      **Welcome to the December 2013 issue of the *Washington Socialist***

      (***Meeting dates and a notice ***

      ***at the foot of this column…)***

      Having just endured what has come to be called Black Friday (and is morphing into Bleak Thanksgiving), we note with mixed feelings that some of our core concerns as socialists have risen to high levels of public attention – because the news is so bad. Our issues –  joblessness and underemployment, a low-wage corporate regime, public revulsion at the moribund federal minimum wage and its visible consequences, and health implications of the lack of paid sick leave in local jurisdictions – are out front, for now. Whether they will stay in the public eye is at least to some extent dependent on the readers of this newsletter.The public’s awareness of these issues has been driven by courageous workers at the bottom of the wage scale – at Walmart, at fast-food outlets and other bottom feeders that combine low wages with sub-fulltime hours to extract the cheapest of labor – who have pushed back against their conditions. Social media and some mainstream media coverage have raised the salience of these efforts. And local and state governments here and around the country are [*taking action*](http://meetup.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=5bb87cda33&e=003de9ccab) to raise minimum wages in the pathetic absence of any Congressional willingness to raise the federal minimum of \$7.25 an hour.

      In suburban Maryland and the District, a regional effort is nearing fruition. Montgomery and Prince George’s counties have passed minimum wage bills that will raise the minimum in stages to \$11.50 per hour by 2017. The D.C. Council is scheduled to vote on a companion measure Tuesday, Dec. 3. That’s after our press time, but we’ll update it on the website. Lead sponsors Marc Elrich on the Montgomery Council and Prince George’s council chairwoman Andrea Harrison may both have to fend off veto threats from their respective county executives, but both bills were supported by veto-proof majorities at the time of their passage.

      According to the weekly *Gazette*, “Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) has said he plans to make a minimum wage increase a priority and Maryland is expected take up a bill in the 2014 session to raise the statewide minimum wage to \$10.10.” Local sponsors for the bill are not clear yet; last year Del. Aisha Braveboy of Prince Georges’ 25^th^ District was a co-sponsor of the version that failed but this year she has declared a run for state Attorney General.

      Progressive Maryland, a union-allied group, published [*results *](http://meetup.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=5c42dcee68&e=003de9ccab)Nov. 12 of a poll showing 83% of Marylanders polled favored raising the minimum wage to \$10.10 per hour. The federal \$7.25 wage currently applies in the Free State.

      Maryland’s legislature will also see a return of a [*paid sick leave measure*](http://meetup.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=ce2361af31&e=003de9ccab) that failed in the last session. It would allow the state’s 700,000 workers not now covered by sick leave policy to earn paid sick days. A campaign for paid sick leave in the District is also being pursued by the alt-labor Restaurant Opportunity Council. For many low-wage workers an unpaid day off for illness or a child’s illness risks missing rent or utility payments – not to mention being fired.

      Many other states and local governments [*have recently passed, or are considering,*](http://meetup.us5.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=403f0a5d36&e=003de9ccab) measures to raise jurisdictional minimum wages well above the federal minimum.\
      Black Friday saw many actions in support of Walmart and other low-wage workers as they pushed for higher wages and protested management attempts to punish or fire workers who participated in organizing activities – a charge that the National Labor Relations Board [*has preliminarily upheld*](http://meetup.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=28f76d7a66&e=003de9ccab) against Walmart.\
      Progressive activists should not pass up the chance, even in the holiday season, to support and engage with these and other efforts.

[*Building trust, defending
rights*](http://dsadc.org/building-trust-defending-rights/)

Sunday, December 1st, 2013

 ***The Washington Socialist* &lt;&gt; December 2013**

** ***By Kurt Stand*

  Congressional action and inaction last year – part of a
right-wing/corporate assault on democratic rights – victimized millions
via the sequester and the government shutdown, through budget cuts that
hurt the neediest and tax breaks that help the wealthiest. And among
those most hurt by such action/inaction have been immigrants, millions
of whom are forced to live in a shadow world because Congress has
refused to pass just and comprehensive immigration reform legislation,
as well as because of federal and local enforcement of unjust laws that
deem categories of people living in the country as “illegals.” These
laws are and should be seen as unjust like those segregation laws that
defined African Americans as being second-class citizens.

  Difficulty in making progress nationally has therefore pushed the
struggle to the states – and there progress has been made in Maryland. .
Last year, state legislators passed the Dream Act, enabling children of
immigrants – many who have spent virtually their whole life in the U.S.
– to attend college. This important measure opened up opportunities, the
chance for a future, for many whose hopes up til then had been denied.
Nonetheless that step alone didn’t fully legalize their status or the
status of their family members; the danger of being subject to unfair
and unjust treatment under the law, including the danger of deportation,
remains. Thus the battle for immigrant rights in the state has taken a
new direction. Prince George’s County State Senator Victor Ramirez
(D-47^th^) – with support from Casa de Maryland, SEIU, and the ACLU – is
proposing the “Maryland Trust Act,” legislation that would prohibit
local police from holding immigrants for transfer to federal immigration
unless they have been charged or convicted of felonies.

 This legislation is designed to establish community trust in law
enforcement, trust impossible when something as simple as a traffic
ticket can lead to someone’s deportation, splitting families, taking
livelihoods, creating fear. Such a measure is an assertion of state
authority designed to *protect* civil liberties, and stands in direct
opposition to state measures of voter suppression and civil rights
abuses directed at African Americans in states like Alabama, North
Carolina and Texas – states also at the forefront of targeting and
harassing immigrants. Absent such laws, local police can be used by
right-wing forces to disrupt community organizing, and can be and have
been used by business interests to try and undermine union organizing
drives. The past two decades have seen numerous instances of collusion
between local police and immigration police to arrest and deport workers
who are raising their voices in packinghouse and other industries.

  Ramirez’s bill is modeled on a similar measure signed into law last
month in California and is based on research and policy proposals
developed by the ACLU and presented in the report “Restoring Trust: How
Immigration Detainers in Maryland Undermine Public Safety Through
Unnecessary Enforcement.” According to a “Maryland Juice” post, key
findings in the ACLU report include:

-   Most individuals held on an immigration detainer in Maryland are
    charged only with traffic violations or minor misdemeanor offenses.

-   The overwhelming majority of people targeted by immigration
    detainers in Maryland are Latino.

-   Immigration detainers undermine public safety and community trust in
    local law enforcement by entangling local authorities in federal
    immigration enforcement.

-   Immigration detainers are purely voluntary requests that impose
    costs on local jurisdictions, and those costs are not reimbursed by
    the federal government.

-   Several states, counties, and cities across the United States have
    taken steps to stop detaining individuals based solely on
    immigration detainer requests.

 If the bill is passed it will be a step toward equalization of rights
between communities. Another such initiative is taking place now in the
on-going labor/community legislative drive to increase the minimum wage
in Prince George’s and Montgomery Counties in Maryland and in Washington
DC, in order to create a regional minimum wage of \$11.50 per hour,
indexed to inflation. The idea behind pushing the same bill in all three
jurisdictions is to create a common front so that lower wages in one
area are not used to push down wages in other areas. And indexing the
gains to inflation means that today’s progress won’t be lost each time
the local cost of living rises. Absent that, a full-time worker with two
children has a standard of living at or below the poverty level,
makingany path out of that poverty far more difficult.

     Initiatives such as these won’t substitute for needed federal
action, but they are important stepping stones toward that end. Victory,
however, will not come easily — as seen in Washington DC where Walmart
used its economic power to blackmail the city and force a rollback of
proposed wage increases that had been easily passed by the City Council.
And, as comments on Ramirez’ legislation indicates, his bill will be
fought by demagogic appeals to fear and hatred, by the effort to blame
our country’s economic distress on those without rights so that those
with power are held unaccountable. Yet the progress made in Maryland
last year is a sign that these victories can be won – and each such
victory can provide a basis to further social and economic equality and
thereby fight back against corporate power’s attempts to render
democratic rights meaningless.

How the TARP Program for Banks Was Sold & How It Really Worked — Under
Bush & Obama

***The Washington Socialist* &lt;&gt; December 2013**

*By Andy Feeney*

Book review of *Bailout: An Inside Account of How Washington Abandoned
Main Street While Rescuing Wall Street*, by Neil Barofsky, former
Special Inspector General in Charge of Oversight of TARP. (New York:
Free Press, 2012)

 

In October 2008, Neil Barofsky was an aggressive young prosecutor
working for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan on mortgage-related
financial fraud. A lifelong Democrat, he was surprised when his
Republican boss persuaded the Bush administration to hire him as Special
Inspector General for the newly created Troubled Assets Relief Program
(TARP), which then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson had hastily cobbled
together to avert the overall collapse of a tottering U.S. financial
system.

In *Bailout*, his memoir of attempting to provide anti-fraud oversight
for TARP, Barofsky provides the reader with a lively anecdotal account
of how TARP evolved and functioned, first under the outgoing Bush White
House and then under Obama’s team.

In telling the tale, Barofsky provides informative vignettes of – among
many others— Neel Kashkari, the 35-year-old former Goldman Sachs vice
president chosen to administer the new bailout program by Bush Treasury
Secretary Hank Paulson, and Herb Allison, a courtly 65-year-old
financial industry veteran who was tapped by Obama’s new Treasury chief
Tim Geithner to run TARP after Kashkari’s departure. Fascinating
glimpses of other well-known Washington personalities also are scattered
through the book, giving us insights into political players like Barney
Frank, Elizabeth Warren, conservative Republican senator Charles
Grassley, Alabama’s Sen. Richard Shelby, and many others.

Beyond the trove of collected personality profiles that Barofsky
furnishes in this memoir, however, is one big and uncomfortable truth:
in Barofsky’s estimation, TARP never worked well – or to be more
accurate, it worked for some of the big banks, but it never delivered
what its proponents and administrators had promised it would also
deliver: relief for millions of heavily indebted homeowners whose
mortgages were at risk of foreclosure in the wake of the 2008 financial
crisis.

Instead, Barofsky writes, first the Bush Treasury Department and then
the Obama team devised scheme after scheme to employ hundreds of
billions of dollars in taxpayer funds to bail out the biggest US banks
that had helped to create runaway speculation in mortgage-backed
securities, and that profited heavily from the trend until it exploded.
Both administrations also resisted Barofsky’s proposals for anti-fraud
controls on the TARP outlays, thus making it extremely difficult for him
to do his job.

In response to his proposals, Barofsky reports of one tense meeting with
the Bush team for TARP, “Kashkari suggested that requiring banks to
report on their use of funds could actually destroy … TARP and perhaps,
as a result, the entire banking system. He accused us of being
politically motivated or just plain stupid.”

Despite Barofsky’s hopes, Obama’s new Treasury team, featuring Geithner
and Allison, failed to bring much improvement over Kashkari and the
Republicans. Under Democratic as well as under Republican auspices, the
bailout program continued to shovel huge sums of money in the direction
of the bankers, with minimal if any oversight from the Special Inspector
General’s office.

When Geithner’s Treasury Department, which by now was attempting to
relabel the TARP program as the Financial Stability Plan, unveiled a
huge new scheme for helping endangered mortage holders as well as the
financial industry – a plan that Geithner called the Public Private
Investment Program (PPIP) — Barofsky and his staff were stunned by the
potential financial holes and loopholes in it.

“The fraud risks jumped out at us,” he writes. “Although it was going to
be funded overwhelmingly with taxpayer dollars, PPIP had been designed
by Wall Street, for Wall Street. We only later learned, in connection
with one of our audits, that at the same time that Treasury had been
keeping us in the dark, it had been working on the design of the program
with … two of the giant investment houses that would later manage funds
under the program and stand to profit from it the most.”

Yet – at least according to Barofsky’s account – Geithner and other
Treasury Department officials stoutly resisted his attempts as Special
IG to prevent serious abuse of the program. As Barofsky fought back
against his Treasury Department superiors by using his power as an
auditor to issue a series of well-publicized reports outlining potential
problems with the ongoing bailout efforts, he found himself being
attacked in the *Wall Street Journal* by anonymous Treasury officials
who accused him of trying to scare bankers away from the financial
rescue package. Late in his career as Special Inspector General for
TARP, he was attacked by name by a White House press official, an Obama
appointee, for allegedly undermining the program.

Why was there such bipartisan pushback against efforts to provide
financial oversight of TARP and its successor programs? Why did those
administering the programs repeatedly sacrifice the interests of
homeowners facing foreclosure while focusing obsessively on helping the
banks, as Barofsky reports they did?

*Bailout* offers an intriguing series of insights as to what may have
motivated the Republicans and Democrats who administered TARP. To start
with, Barofsky strongly suggests, the pressures of electoral politics in
an off-year Congressional election year probably explained some of the
hits that the TARP Special Inspector General’s office took from the
Obama team in 2010.

The added fact – much lamented by the political left at the time — that
both the Bush administration and the Obama White House filled
high-ranking economic policy positions in Washington with financial
veterans of the same professional circles on Wall Street that had helped
to create the near-financial collapse of 2008 in the first place was, in
Barofsky’s view, another key factor.

Such Treasury appointees as Paulson, Kashkari, Geithner and Allison all
had the same or similar backgrounds as the banking officials they were
overseeing, and Barofsky thinks they simply could not imagine that their
old colleagues – who had previously driven the global financial system
to the brink of the abyss – might somehow lack the integrity or the
genius to save it.

But one far more basic and highly disquieting fact about TARP as Barosky
portrays it is that the program was sold under false pretenses from the
start. Hank Paulson, after previously denying that there was anything
seriously wrong with the US financial sector, rolled out a proposed
\$700 billion TARP program in the fall of 2008 in hopes of preventing a
total failure of the banks.

Paulson promoted his original scheme as a way to relieve endangered
homeowners as well as banks by using TARP’s unprecedented budget to buy
up “toxic” mortgages and remove them from the bankers’ books, Barofsky
notes. Some progressive Congressional Democrats reluctantly supported
the plan for that reason. But by the time Congress finally approved the
program, Paulson had already decided his original scheme would be too
slow to provide the relief needed, and he therefore carved a \$250
billion sub-program out of the original \$700 plan to provide immediate
infusions of cash to several of the biggest banks, without doing
anything about their toxic mortgages.

When Congress howled in protest, Paulson insisted that the banks getting
the money were healthy, and that the new funds would help spur them into
lending money and restarting economic growth. But Paulson himself later
admitted to him, according to Barofsky, that at least two of the banks
getting the CPP money were believed ready to collapse, and as it turned
out, the banks getting relief were still too uncertain about the
economy’s health to lend out the funds they’d been given. Instead, they
sat on them, for the sake of their own security, and the benefits to the
economy were limited.

CPP and in a larger sense TARP, in short, were designed by Paulson to
inject huge amounts of government money into the financial sector to
prevent immediate economic Armageddon, and the assurances given to
Congress and the public about relief for homeowners were just window
dressing for this fact. This suggests that Kashkari may have been
completely sincere in saying that Barofsky’s proposed anti-fraud
safeguards for the bailout fund might have wrecked the entire financial
sector. Treasury officials wanted to rescue the banks, period, without
drawing anyone’s attention to their perilously fragile condition,
Barofsky concludes; and naturally, they hated the idea of the Special
Inspector General’s office drawing public attention to this.

Geithner apparently didn’t confide in Barofsky as Paulson allegedly did.
But judging from *Bailout*’s narrative of the Geithner years, the Obama
Treasury Department seems to have been motivated by the same fear of
total collapse that apparently motivated Paulson and Kashkari.

The root problem, Barofsky argues late in this book, is that the US
financial sector in 2008 really was dominated by a few giant banks and
other financial institutions that were so entwined with one another and
with other parts of the financial industry that they had become “too big
to fail,” and both Bush Republicans and Obama Democrats deemed it
urgently important to throw money at them to prevent that potential
disaster – but without being candid with the voters or underwater
homeowners that this was the government’s aim.

Since 2008 and the passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, as
Barofsky and many other commentators have noted, the largest banks have
gotten even larger and more central to the financial sector than they
were at the time of the last financial collapse. What’s more, the health
of our capitalist U.S. economy depends in large part on private
investors’ – whether wealthy individuals or large institutions— having
the confidence (what Keynes once termed the “animal spirits”) to risk
large sums on making new investments in production, distribution and
exchange.

Having a financially fragile banking system – and what’s worse, having
smart and aggressive regulatory officials from the government, like
Barofsky in his tenure – publicly commenting on the system’s weakness is
potentially fatal to investor confidence, as Barofsky comes close to
admitting in this memoir.

What this suggests to many socialists, anyway, is that until we devise a
somewhat different economic system with somewhat different arrangements
for insuring investment and re-investment in the real economy, we can
probably count on bailouts of this ilk being repeated, and Treasury
officials lying to the public as this occurs.

 ***The Washington Socialist* &lt;&gt; December 2013**

*By Bill Mosley*

Review of *The Right to Stay Home: How US Policy Drives Mexican
Migration* by David Bacon. Beacon Press, Boston, 2013.

The debate over U.S. immigration policy has largely become a question
over what to do about immigrants already in the United States. Smooth
their path to citizenship? Give them green cards and enroll them in
guest-worker programs? Throw them out? Send them to prison?

To assume that large numbers of people from abroad will always clamor to
enter the United States, legally or not, unfortunately casts the debate
in terms favorable to the anti-immigrant right. Charismatic xenophobes
such as Fox TV commentator Lou Dobbs and Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff
Joe Arpaio eagerly raise the specter of foreign hordes at the gates – or
inside the gates – aiming to steal our jobs and corrupt our culture
while refusing to learn English. Even liberals and the left tend to
focus on legalization and a path to citizenship, rather on the more
fundamental question – why do so many people from Mexico and other
countries come to the United States in the first place?

Labor journalist and former union organizer David Bacon provides a
necessary corrective to the notion of the inevitability of large-scale
immigration with his new book *The Right to Stay Home: How US Policy
Drives Mexican Migration*. The book could be viewed as Part II of
Bacon’s dissection of U.S. immigration policy, following 2008’s *Illegal
People: How Globalization Creates Migration and Criminalizes Immigrants.
*

In his latest book, Bacon supplements his own reportage and analysis
with narratives by migrants themselves, describing in their own words
their experiences in the United States – why they left Mexico, their
exploitation and mistreatment by their employers, and their attempts to
fight back. Bacon relayed some of these stories in a talk last October
at Democratic Socialists of America’s national convention in Oakland,
Calif.

In both of his books, Bacon shows why so many Mexicans and persons of
other nationalities are desperately trying to enter the United States –
not from the lure of living in “the land of the free,” but because
globalization and U.S. corporate priorities are driving them here. And
while Bacon largely examines migration of Mexicans, his analysis also
could apply to many of the countries and regions that are the source of
large numbers of migrants, especially Central America and Asia. Yet his
focus on Mexico allows him to more sharply illustrate the impact of
globalization on the country that is by far the source of the greatest
number of migrants – both documented and not – to the United States.

In both books, Bacon skillfully connects the dots between neoliberal
trade policy and the desperation that drives people from Mexico to the
United States. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which
took effect in 1994, broke down trade barriers between the United
States, Canada and Mexico. This allowed cheap, industrially produced
U.S. agricultural products – notably corn – to flood the Mexican market,
causing prices to plummet below the level that would allow Mexican
farmers to make a profit. This drove countless Mexican farmers off the
land to seek work elsewhere. Many migrated within Mexico, but many
others crossed the border to the United States where certain kinds of
jobs were plentiful – seasonal agricultural jobs or work in
meat-processing factories lured many of them. Although many of these
jobs were difficult and dangerous, and almost all of them paid below a
living wage for a U.S. worker, the difference between the cost of living
in the United States and Mexico made it possible for Mexican migrant
workers to subsist while sending part of their pay back to their
families south of the border. This suited the Mexican government,
because the remittances – in excess of \$20 billion annually — were a
valuable source of income, and encouraged successive Mexican governments
to collaborate with U.S. neoliberal trade policy.

U.S. corporations welcomed the migrants because they were willing to
work cheap – especially undocumented immigrants, who were trying to stay
under the radar of U.S. immigration authorities and therefore tended to
be reluctant to fight back against unjust treatment. And there has been
plenty of that: Bacon documents rampant abuses faced by migrant workers,
such as wage theft, barely habitable housing, exposure to toxic
pesticides, sexual assaults on female workers and much more.

Bacon makes sense of the seeming contradiction of U.S. corporations
eagerly exploiting desperate migrant workers while the U.S. government,
in the form of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), hunts them
down for deportation or even imprisonment. In fact, the companies and
ICE work hand in glove: When migrant workers become too assertive in
protesting brutal conditions or, especially, when they become so bold as
to try to organize a union, the employer tips off ICE, which then rushes
in with arrests and deportation orders – a practice that has accelerated
during the Obama administration. The company then hires a new batch of
undocumented workers and starts afresh.

Even under such oppressive conditions, a surprisingly large number of
migrants have attempted to speak up or fight back. In Los Angeles,
Mexican migrant workers became leaders of International Longshore and
Warehouse Union and United Electrical Workers locals. Sometimes workers
fired for lack of documents take to the streets, as did large numbers of
San Francisco janitors in 2010, although their protests failed to win
them back their jobs. Bacon also illustrates the growth of solidarity
between unions on both sides of the border with the growing recognition
that U.S. and Mexican workers face a common struggle.

Some employers, mostly bigger companies that hire large numbers of
non-citizens, would prefer an expanded guest-worker program rather than
rely on undocumented workers – in other words, a return to the *bracero*
program that brought large numbers of Mexican workers to the United
States from the 1940s to the 1960s. These workers, initially imported to
compensate for worker shortages during World War II, came to be used
regularly by companies to replace striking workers and break unions. The
*bracero* program also was characterized by abusive treatment of the
workers, and was not so different from today’s program that provides a
limited number of temporary visas for foreign workers who are recruited
by specific companies. These companies seek a more “managed” form of
immigration, one that provides them with a low-cost, docile workforce
without the threat of ICE raids. Smaller employers, however, tend to
prefer undocumented workers, who will work cheaper and be even less
likely to speak up against unfair treatment.

Employers are supposedly subject to sanctions for knowingly hiring
undocumented immigrants. But, as Bacon shows, companies are hardly ever
penalized for the practice. ICE will frequently notify a company that
many of their employees have Social Security numbers that do not match
their names, a sign that the numbers may be fictitious or “borrowed”
from real cardholders and therefore being used by undocumented
immigrants. However, this only encourages the company to fire the
suspect workers, and there are seldom further repercussions for the
employer – but for the employee, the result is unemployment and possibly
worse.

Bacon argues that the immigration debate must emphasize reducing the
need for people to leave their communities in the first place.
Organizations such as the Binational Front of Indigenous Organizations
have led strikes and other protests, largely in the poorer regions of
southern Mexico, demanding alleviation of the conditions that drive
people out of their communities in order to survive.

“”Without addressing the sources of the displacement that pushes people
into the guest worker stream, recommendations for better management
assume an inherent desire on the part of workers to come to the United
States,” Bacon writes.

A major step in halting forced migration, Bacon asserts, would be to
renegotiate NAFTA and other trade agreements that are the cause of
displacement. Progressives should support policies that strengthen local
economies in Mexico, making them more self-sufficient and less subject
to the vicissitudes of the global economy.

Canceling or reducing Mexico’s foreign debt would go a long way to
making unnecessary the remittances by Mexican workers in the United
States. Remittances account for 2 percent of Mexico’s GDP, but these are
largely swallowed by the country’s debt payments, which are 3 percent of
GDP. Without the debt, the payments could be used for local development
projects that in time would make the remittances unnecessary.

Another part of the solution must be better treatment of all migrants in
the United States. One way to make guest-worker programs less
oppressive, Bacon argues, would be to allow holders of work permits to
seek employment anywhere they wish, rather than have their right to be
in the United States tied to employment with a specific company. The
current system is a form of indentured servitude in which the company
can threaten employees not only with firing but almost-certain
deportation if they become too assertive.

A welcome challenge to the criminalization of migrants was the AFL-CIO’s
reversal of its stance on immigration. Once concerned about migrants as
competitors for their members’ jobs, in 1999 the federation “called for
the repeal of employee sanctions, legalization of the undocumented, and
enforcing labor rights for all workers,” Bacon writes. In addition, last
year President Obama told ICE to stop deporting young people who were
brought to the United States as children if they were attending or had
graduated from school or served in the military – although he was
unsuccessful in persuading Congress from passing the Dream Act, meaning
that their ability to remain here is subject to the whim of whomever
occupies the White House.

Migrant activists and their allies amplified their demands by
participating in the 2011 Occupy protests and by protesting the attacks
the same year against Wisconsin public-sector workers. In communities
such as Seattle, San Diego and Oakland, Calif., the Occupy movement’s
tactics were inspired by the Mexican tradition of the *planton*, an
encampment in a public square designed to focus public attention on a
particular demand or injustice. In Wisconsin, Bacon writes, the message
of migrants and U.S. citizens alike was: “We all work, we all contribute
to our communities and we all have the right to a job, a union and a
decent life.”

Yet a sensible, just solution to the immigration crisis is contrary to
corporate interests and those of their cronies in both the U.S. and
Mexican governments. It will take a vocal, sophisticated movement on
both sides of the border to force the “right to stay home” onto the
agenda of policymakers. That movement is growing in Mexico, and it needs
more allies north of the border. Yet David Bacon has done his part in
providing that movement with facts, ideas and stories that will help it
succeed.

***The Washington Socialist* &lt;&gt; December 2013**

*By Carolyn M. Byerly*

First, the back story.

It’s a fact that more and more of the world’s people are getting their
news online these days, but the traditional news media – increasingly
called the “legacy media” – remain the main employers of both print and
electronic journalists. Add to this another fact: Those media still
actively discriminate against their women employees the world over.

But how bad is it, and how does it differ from nation to nation?

In 2008, I was asked by the International Women’s Media Foundation to
oversee a global study of women’s employment in the traditional news
companies to answer these questions. The project would take over my
academic life for several years, culminate in more statistical data than
anyone would ever use, and produce two publications – a technical report
and an academic text. This was not done singlehandedly – I had a small
budget that was used to secure and pay a team of 160 researchers in 59
nations (whom I would also supervise – that was fun). The project would
encompass interviews with executives at 522 companies (newspapers, TV &
radio stations). The media we surveyed published or broadcast in nearly
40 different languages; however, completed questionnaires were submitted
to me in English, Spanish and French. After months of data entry and
fussing with numbers (hooray for statisticians), I wrote (and IWMF
published) the 400-page technical report in 2011(See *Global Report on
the Status of Women in News Media*, downloadable free at
[*www.iwmf.org*](http://www.iwmf.org)).

What the study found will be summarized shortly.

But now the current story:

In late October, the second publication, *The Palgrave International
Handbook of Women and Journalism*, came into print. It included 29 of
the original 59 nations, with most chapters written by the original
researchers for those nations. (See details on the book at
http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=634271)

Did I mention looking for a publisher? It turns out that book publishing
has gone through the same conglomeration process as other media (all
over the world), and few academic publishers in the social sciences want
to publish real research (which now goes almost exclusively to
journals). Publishers have shifted to textbooks, mostly, which are more
lucrative. The UK-based Palgrave Macmillan Company is one of few that
still recognizes the value of original work and its editors were excited
about the project from the outset.

What distinguishes the *Palgrave Handbook* from its predecessor *Global
Report* is that the findings for each of the 29 nations are discussed in
greater detail, within a context of history, politics, media-government
relations, culture and women’s status. I authored four chapters,
including one on feminist political economy of news that makes an effort
at situating women in the neoliberalized (is that a word?) news
industry. The book is arguably the biggest effort to date to determine
where women fit into the newsmaking apparatus of companies across the
world. While not comprehensive (we did not even set out to gather data
on all companies), it is representative – and revealing.

When aggregated, the data from those original 59 nations show women
beginning to do quite well within the profession at the reporting ranks,
and, in some nations, even in the lower rungs of newsroom management.
But in nearly ALL nations, there is a clear glass ceiling, with men
dominating in top management and governance roles of traditional media
companies. Women are also marginalized in technical jobs, e.g., camera
work and production.

There are some surprises. Women journalists seem to fare best in the
former communist nations of Eastern Europe, where the goal was to
educate women for the workforce. Women are near parity with men and in
some nations (e.g., Russia) even surpass them in number. Why? Journalism
became feminized during the Soviet-era news industry, which was both
heavily oriented to state propaganda and also low paid. After the Berlin
Wall came down, and those nations moved toward democracy, women were
already in place in those newsrooms and have retained their jobs.
Authors of these nations, however, are quick to point out that sexism
still abounds in the news and other employment sectors and across the
broader society.

Women journalists also fare well in the Nordic nations, where the
Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish authors noted “gender equality is a
public consensus” and laws for several decades provide the framework for
women’s advancement professionally. It also helps that these nations
have extremely generous maternity and paternity benefits, as well as
community based public daycare centers.

By contrast, in Japan, men outnumber women 7:1 in news companies. In
Bangladesh, India and Jordan, the ratio is 5:1, and in Lebanon, 2:1.
Here in the USA, women are inching toward parity with men in reporting
roles and even in middle management (e.g., senior editors), but not so
in the higher roles of decision making. The glass-ceiling is firmly in
place even in this nation which has experienced a more vigorous era of
feminism than many others.

Leftists are likely to dismiss traditional news media as sources of the
truth; however, there is no way to dismiss those them as workplaces.
Newsrooms have greatly (also gravely) been affected by major structural
shifts these last two decades, the most obvious two being digital
convergence and a rapid process of conglomeration. Often overlooked are
the gendered dimensions of these events, and so it is significant that
the majority of the authors in the *Palgrave Handbook* talked about
media conglomeration and its impact on women journalists in their
countries (both developed and developing). Some examples are layoffs,
the switch from full to part-time (or freelance) positions, and a level
of emotional tension on the job produced by uncertainty. Women feel
these pinches disproportionately within this occupation, as they do in
others, and it falls to leftist feminist researchers to examine these
lest they be ignored.

war*](http://dsadc.org/virginia-elections-2013-dems-slip-by-amid-gop-civil-war/)

***The Washington Socialist* &lt;&gt; December 2013**

*By Daniel C. Adkins*

The 2013 Virginia elections were unique in that it was the Democrats
against the Tea Party. The Democrats seem to have won the state-wide
offices although the Attorney General race is headed for a recount. The
Tea Party’s war on women’s health aided the Democrats, as women voted in
larger numbers for Democrats. The government shut-down also aided the
Democrats by pissing off federal workers, their contractors, and the
workers and businesses that support them.

The race was won partly because a civil war is starting in the
Republican Party. There was much criticism of the Republicans’ having a
convention to choose their statewide slate. This tactic favors the
extremists. Some business-oriented Republicans stopped funding their
party and supported the Democrats. In other parts of the US,
business-oriented Republicans are supporting candidates in primaries for
the first time in order to minimize the Tea Party effect and get
electable candidates. Demographic changes aid the Democrats and
Asian-Virginians made appearances in several races.

However, the multi-cultural environment of Northern Virginia and cities
has not spread to southern Virginia. Given the Republican gerrymandering
and the slowness of demographic change, we should not count the Tea
Party out anytime soon.

Sometimes we question the time spent on elections. However, protecting
the poor, workers, the environment, and stopping the war on women are
important goals. Also there is an opportunity to organize our
neighborhoods, condos, and apartments. A useful tactic we can do today
is to get our apartment building or condos to post our polling places on
our apartment websites. With the natural turnover of residents, it helps
to get our allies to vote to the maximum extent. Also, in aiding
elections we have a chance to meet politically committed people. Now is
a time that many Democrats are wondering about what role their party has
played in raising inequality in the US. This is still a great time for a
discussion.
