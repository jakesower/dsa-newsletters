[{"title":"Commodified Nature – Capitalism's (Most) Fatal Error","date":"2014-09-06","issue":"September 2014","author":"Lucy Duff","body":"For Labor Day, a look backward at thoughts Red and Green, on the intertwined fortunes of working people and the natural and social worlds we all inhabit, starting with Karl Polanyi from 70 years ago.\n\nLong before Thomas Piketty's acclaimed *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* (2013; English translation Belknap Press, 2014) came Karl Polanyi's path-making study of capitalism, *The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time*, first published in 1944 and reissued by Beacon Press in 1957 and again, with a foreword by Joseph E. Stiglitz, in 2001.\n\nA scholar in Budapest and then a reformist journalist in Vienna, Polanyi wrote his masterwork while an intellectual refugee in England and later the U.S. Surveying European history from the late 18<sup>th</sup> through the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, he developed and documented his theory that the classical-economics idea of a self-regulating economic system had always been a fantasy. The crucial error lay in having reduced human life, the natural world and the social inheritance – elements manifestly not produced for sale— into the \"fictitious commodities\" labor, land and capital, respectively. Yet the fantasy held real power, as a capitalist prop under the Industrial Revolution, to wreck the land, exploit the labor force, and generally dislocate traditional \"organic society.\" That society – which had previously subordinated small local markets – was thus transformed into the market *system*, \"one big Market,\" that became the \"basic organizing principle of society\" dominating peoples and places rural and urban, domestic and foreign.\n\n\"There was nothing natural about *laissez-faire*,\" Polanyi writes; it took the intervention of deliberate state planning to pin that airy idea to the ground. And politics maintains it in the real world. What *was* spontaneous, in his view, was the long \"social protection\" countermovement to restrict the damages of the policy, very slowly and but partially successful in \"the conservation of man and nature as well as productive organization.\" He sees the countermovement as based on a changing mixture of class and common interests. Today, of course, we find the competing sides of what he termed this \"double movement\" still very active worldwide. Thinkers crossing varied disciplines have continued to apply Polanyi's thesis to the accelerating juggernaut of capitalist accumulation in our tightly interconnected global economy. And they propose varied channels, revived or new, for a continuing multi-faceted countermovement.\n\n*Recently* sociologists Margaret Somers and Fred Block revisited *The Great Transformation. *In [**\"The Return of Karl Polanyi\"**](http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-return-of-karl-polanyi) (*Dissent*, Spring 2014) they introduce their book *The Power of Market Fundamentalism: Karl Polanyi's Critique* (Harvard University Press, April 2014). Henry Farrell's July 18 *Washington Post* interview with the writers – *\"The free market is an impossible utopia\"* – aptly picks up Polanyi's own ironic catchword for the fantastic undergirding of the capitalist system.\n\n**In their article Somers and Block characterize Polanyi as \"a heterodox thinker—even among fellow socialists. With some significant exceptions, it has taken decades to recognize the extraordinary theoretical contributions to socialist thought that he made in his masterpiece .... He is regularly invoked by both scholars and activists who challenge unfettered free-market globalization, and his writings are increasingly part of the core canon for sociologists, political scientists, historians, and heterodox economists. Last November the *Atlantic* invoked Karl Polanyi, not Karl Marx, as the social thinker most relevant to Pope Francis's widely circulated moral injunction on the evils of social inequality and the limits of unregulated markets—just one sign of Polanyi's recent fame.\" Not a dogmatic Marxist, he did not prejudge the necessity for collective ownership of all means of production: \"Polanyi, in contrast, insists that since the economic order is constituted through political decisions, politics can effectively redefine the meaning of ownership.\" Looking through his eyes, Somers and Block take fresh hope for \"revitalizing the democratic socialist tradition.\"\n\nAlso in tune with Polanyi are a number of environmental scientists, economists and activists. Ecological economist Herman Daly, proponent since the 1970s of a \"steady-state economy\" and a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland, draws explicitly from him. In *For the Common Good: Redirecting the Economy Toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future* (Beacon Press, 1989), Daly and co-author John B. Cobb cite Polanyi's observation that since the Great Transformation \"social relations are embedded in the economic system.\" They go on to say \"an economics for community cannot tolerate\" that reversal, and to point out that capitalism deals with Polanyi's \"fictitious commodities\" as though humanity, nature and the social inheritance were merely products, rather than the means of production. By the \"fallacy of misplaced concreteness\" mainstream economists hide the full, true foundations of social well-being with overly abstracted concepts; since \"money is the common denominator for land and labor as well as capital\" the priceless realities disappear from their analyses.\n\nAfter admiring reference to Polanyi's theory and a nod of respect to others' discussion of labor and capital as commodities, Daly and Cobb focus mainly on issues around land, \"a very peculiar commodity\" given its inseparability from the Biosphere with no surveyor-laid borders. Yet they acknowledge that the three fictions at root form one problem. Concluding with recommended policies for the U.S., they return to Polanyi's insistence that \"separating labor from the rest of life\" so as to subject it to market laws created a system that \"could not exist for any length of time without annihilating the human and natural substance of society.\" And their key policy goals – equity of distribution, sustainability of natural resources, and efficiency in maintaining wealth- relate to all three factors.\n\nGerman economist E. F. Schumacher, also a 1930's refugee in England, echoes Polanyi when he speaks of how modern economics disturbs our whole reality by its illusory separation of its elements. In his classic work, *Small is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered* (Blond & Briggs, 1973; reprinted by Harper, 2010) he reminds us that \"man-as-producer and man-as-consumer is in fact the same man, who is always producing and consuming at the same time.\" The disconnection is clearest in the case of industrialized agriculture: a farmer feels driven to cut costs and raise cash even if that means he \"destroys... the health of the soil and the beauty of the landscape.\" Confusion arises \"as long as the land and the creatures upon it are looked upon as *nothing but* 'factors of production,'...but this is their secondary, not their primary, nature.\" Despite the beliefs of those \"alienated from living nature...any society can afford to look after its land and keep it healthy and beautiful in perpetuity.\" Schumacher too sees the market in the modern world as having reversed tradition, putting means over ends. All goals other than accumulation of wealth \"take second place.\" In fact, this 'logic of production' is and should be seen as, \"neither the logic of life nor that of society. It is a small and subservient part of both.\" Beyond an end to exploitation of people and nature worldwide, he calls for restoring the balance of \"wealth, power, culture, attraction and hope\" between city and countryside, by developing an \"agro-industrial culture\" with diverse occupations in each locality.\n\nOver his long career Wendell Berry – farmer, activist, poet, storyteller – wrote various essays republished as *Bringing It to the Table* (Counterpoint, 2009). He starkly contrasts two economies, analogous to Polanyi's traditional society and the big market system. Daly and Cobb refer to Berry's \"Great Economy\" of nature, sustainer of the web of life and rightful container of the human economy. It is at odds with the \"Totalitarian Economy\" of industrial agriculture, based on \"the fantasy of the free market.\" In the short term, Totalitarian Economy ruins the self-sufficiency of local communities, drives out their labor force, and allows monopoly capital to value fast profits over the \"claims of posterity.\" Farms become factories; in a process \"closely akin to mining\" much of rural America has become a colony, like coal country at an earlier stage of capitalism. That profit-based system cannot possibly function in the long run. Like Polanyi, Berry perceives the clash of reality and fantasy, and relies on the good sense of ordinary people working together re-create farms, forests, towns, their workplaces and home-places, somewhat in the mold of traditional society, aiming for a secure, sustainable subsistence and neighborly justice.\n\nIn *A Sand County Almanac* (Oxford, 1949), Aldo Leopold succinctly defines \"the basic concept of ecology\" as understanding land not as a commodity but rather \"a community to which we belong.\" It seems fair to say he was restating a key idea of Polanyi, Daly, Schumacher, and Berry.\n\nThis country-born English major and amateur naturalist is content to leave off there. What follows are a few bare quotations from the greener side of Marxism, offered for the scientific-socialist readers of DC-DSA. She awaits with interest to hear what they make of them.\n\n*From Wikipedia entry on eco-socialism:* \"The 'second contradiction' of capitalism\"\n\n\"Building on the work of Karl Polanyi, along with Marx, James O'Connor argues that capitalism necessarily undermines the 'conditions of production' necessary to sustain the endless accumulation of capital. These conditions of production include soil, water, energy... As the conditions of production are exhausted, the costs of production for capital increase. For this reason, the second contradiction generates an underproduction crisis tendency, with the rising cost of inputs and labor... Like Marx's contradiction of capital and labor, the second contradiction therefore threatens the system's existence.\"\n\nO'Connor presents this line of thought in \"Capitalism, nature, socialism a theoretical introduction,\" *Capitalism Nature Socialism* (vol. 1, no. 1, 1988) and published online 2009 at [*http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rcns20*](http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rcns20)\n\n*Decrying a certain \"crude class theory\" of popular Marxism, Polanyi alludes in a side remark to \"the essential philosophy of Marx centered on the totality of society and the noneconomic nature of man\" (p. 151, 1957).* He may have had in mind these lines from *Capital,* vol. 1 (1867), quoted by Chris Williams in *Ecology and Socialism* (Haymarket Books, 2010):\n\n\"\\[Man\\] can work only as Nature does...constantly helped by natural forces. We see, then, that labour is not the only source of wealth.\"\n\n\"All progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the worker, but of robbing the soil...Capitalist production disturbs the metabolic interaction between man and the earth.\"\n\n*Williams also quotes some plainer lines from Engels'* *The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State*, 1884:\n\n\"In relation to nature, as to society, the present mode of production is predominantly concerned only about the immediate, the most tangible result.\"\n\n\"\\[At\\] every step we are reminded that we by no means rule over nature...but that we, with flesh, blood and brain, belong to nature, exist in its midst, and that all our mastery of it consists in the fact that we have the advantage of all other creatures of being able to learn its laws and apply them correctly.\"","order":0},{"title":"Cross-national Dangers of Fast-Track Trade Treaties","date":"2014-09-01","issue":"September 2014","author":"Daniel C. Adkins","body":"The potential damage of fast-tracking trade deals is great because they may supplant congressional legislation. These trade deals include the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). If Congress is not able to fully debate and, if necessary, amend the language of these all-encompassing trade pacts, the environment, our climate, and our families could suffer as a result of multinational lobbyists. Introduced early this year, the Camp-Baucus bill limits transparency to the public and maybe even to the Congress. It has not gotten traction in Congress. However it is being revised and replaced by a new bill this November. Trade bills like NAFTA have increased our exports, but they have increased our imports much more.\n\nIn the rush to do away with trade barriers, these treaties can eviscerate hard-won gains of labor and consumers. The trade bills would undermine unions internationally and sharply diminish U.S. allies by stopping citizens' right to information, consultations, and remedies. Below are some of the possible outcomes that are dangerous to Americans and Europeans.\n\nLori Wallach of *Le Monde Diplomatique* [*wrote in June*](http://mondediplo.com/2014/06/10ttip) about the risks of these trade pacts for those of us in the US; her list is adapted here:\n\n[*TTIP Risks to Americans*](http://mondediplo.com/2014/06/10ttip)\n\n1.  **Financial reforms:** European Union (EU) negotiators have called for the rollback of the Volcker Rule and other Wall Street reforms thus jeopardizing our economic stability.\n\n2.  **Mad cow issues:** The European lobby BUSINESSEUROPE has called bans on beef products a trade barrier. They were not happy with the U.S. ban on mad cow disease and would endanger our health.\n\n3.  **Alternative Fuels:** BUSINESSEUROPE and BP have asked to eliminate tax credits for alternative climate-friendly fuels and slow our move to a sustainable economy.\n\n4.  **Unsafe medicines:** European pharmaceuticals have asked that the US government automatically approve European determinations for drug safety.\n\n5.  **Cost of medicines:** Pharmaceutical companies are pushing to limit governments' ability to negotiate prices of medicines and thus keep health costs from growing.\n\n6.  **Data privacy:** US tech companies want to limit barriers to collection of personal data and make it easier for them to make personal profiles. We could lose control of our life's story.\n\n7.  **Local job creation:** EU officials want to block local governments' \"buy local\" policies and thus threaten our jobs.\n\n8.  **Genetically modified food:** Monsanto and others are pushing to ban labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMO) and thus pave the way for us to eat GMO food without our knowing it.\n\n9.  **Dangerous toys:** The toy industry of Europe wants the safety of European toys to be trusted.\n\n10. **Subordination of state laws to multinational interests:** This is the basic intention of multinationals and would mean our elected representatives will not be able to overturn treaties designed\nby multinationals.\n\n\n\n[*Threats to Europeans were enumerated in another listicle by Wolf Jaklein in the same issue of *Le Monde* *Diplomatique:* again they are summarized here:*](http://mondediplo.com/2014/06/11ttip)\n\n\n\n1.  **Workers' rights:** The US. has ratified two out of eight labor conventions protecting workers of the International Labor Organization while the EU has ratified all eight. European labor fear that their rights will be lost.\n\n2.  **Collective representation:** The main influences to the trade talks are business interests that see labor rights as barriers. Rights to information and work councils could stop at the border.\n\n3.  **Worker and consumer standards:** In Europe products are tested for safety before they are released, whereas in the US products are released and the consumer has the right to sue for product damages. In Europe, risk assessment is not confined to products but also includes working conditions. In the US, workplace safety is limited\nby weak enforcement and a lack of unionization. The creation of a\ntransatlantic Regulatory Cooperation Council free of democratic control and cognitively captured by multinationals is a real danger for European workers.\n\n4.  **Limits of free movement of people:** The TTIP only focuses on the movement of people for business reasons and misses the opportunity to harmonize laws for travel permitting people the rights of goods and capital.\n\n5.  **Sustainable development:** The TTIP may include a chapter relating to social and environmental law. Such chapters generally do not have sanctions to enforce environmental goals while economic and technical sanctions are quite specific. One might be sued for a law limiting profit but not for one violating the environment.\n\n6.  **Public services loss:** Negotiations may list all services not to be privatized. Everything else is up for grabs. Experience has seen the definitions challenged leading to more privatizations and loss of public control. New service needs would by definition be in the private area.\n\n7.  **Increased unemployment:** In the EU all businesses, foreign and domestic, are given public support. The US doesn't have this kind of support but often requires a minimum of \"local content\". This inequality of business markets favors the U. S. businesses and will lead to unemployment in Europe.\n\n8.  **Personal data confidentiality:** Europeans have concern about their personal data but US rules and courts are unconcerned by non-US regulation. Also cloud-based data storage makes national ownership of data difficult.\n\n9.  **Intellectual property rights:** There is a risk to European freedom of publication and distribution to US-style property rights. This may open Europe to counterfeiting and an author's or producer's control of their products' use. This includes access to generic medicines.\n\n10. **Subordination of states to multinationals:** Treaties can trump rights and the massive lobbying of multinationals on trade issues threaten citizen's interests.","order":1},{"title":"DC Mayoral Race Gets the Press, but Open Council Seat Draws the Crowds","date":"2014-09-01","issue":"September 2014","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Readers of the *Washington Post* and other mainstream local publications can be forgiven for thinking that the only contest of interest in this fall's District of Columbia election is the contest for mayor. And indeed, that race has become more than the usual quadrennial coronation of the Democratic mayoral nominee, with two prominent independent candidates challenging Democrat Muriel Bowser.\n\nBut of at least equal interest is the race for the at-large DC Council seat being vacated by David Catania, who has chosen to run for mayor rather than for re-election to his seat. The prospect of capturing an open seat has sparked a gold rush for the office, with 15 candidates qualifying for the ballot.\n\nWith serious contests for both mayor and councilmember-at-large, the 2014 election should generate greater-than-usual interest among DC voters, as well as progressive activists and organizations seeing an opportunity to elect candidates sympathetic to their causes. Metro-DC DSA is one of these organizations, keeping an eye on candidates in preparation for its **September 13** membership meeting at which it will consider endorsements in local races. **The meeting will be held from 1:30-2:30 pm at the Watha T. Daniel/Shaw Public Library, 1630 7<sup>th</sup> St. NW (Shaw/Howard Metro).**\n\nAt its February endorsement meeting, held in advance of the April DC primary election, Metro DC-DSA made endorsements in three DC Democratic Primary races, voting to back Andy Shallal, owner of the Busboys and Poets chain of restaurant/bookstores, for mayor, as well as two incumbents: Eleanor Holmes Norton for delegate to Congress and Phil Mendelson for chair of the DC Council. Norton and Mendelson won their primaries and are expected to cruise to victory in November, while Shallal finished fifth in a field of eight.\n\nAlso to be chosen by voters in the November 4 election are councilmembers from DC Wards 1,3, 5 and 6; a statehood (or \"shadow\") senator and representative; a DC attorney general; members of the Board of Education from each of the eight DC wards; and approximately 200 Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, as well as a ballot initiative on legalization of marijuana. This article will briefly discuss the more high-profile races.\n\n**Mayor**\n\nIn addition to Bowser and Catania, the other well-known candidate in the race to succeed outgoing Mayor Vince Gray is Carol Schwartz, a former Republican councilmember and four-time unsuccessful Republican candidate for mayor, running this time as an independent. Trailing the big three is a crowded field of independents and minor-party candidates – including Faith, the Statehood Green Party nominee and perennial candidate. Also on the ballot are Libertarian Bruce Majors and independent Nestor Djonkam. No Republican ran in the party's primary.\n\nIt's safe to say there is no true \"progressive\" among the top three candidates. Bowser was a protégé of former Mayor Adrian Fenty and a supporter of his takeover of public schools. She has been a cautious centrist who, among other actions on the Council, opposed the Large Retailer Accountability Act (LRAA) which would have required Walmart and other big-box stores to pay a higher-than-minimum wage. Perhaps more than any other recent measure before the Council, the LRAA exposed which candidates were willing to go to bat for DC's low-wage workers and which supported the corporate agenda. Bowser was the principal author of recent ethics legislation – coming in the wake of criminal convictions of three councilmembers and a federal investigation of Gray for campaign finance violations. But her ethical image has been tarnished by charges that she helped a political supporter, the head of a nonprofit apartment complex, avoid public scrutiny of the company's failing finances and the dilapidated condition of its building. In her general election campaign thus far, Bowser has emphasized her Democratic Party affiliation and mostly avoided both the issues and engagement with other candidates. [*Bowser has been endorsed by the Metropolitan Washington Council of the AFL-CIO.*](http://www.dclabor.org/home/metro-council-afl-cio-announces-endorsement-of-murriel-bowser-for-dc-mayor)\n\nCatania, the Council's first openly gay member, is liberal on social issues but business-friendly on economic issues. He has promoted himself as an expert on education, with a record of supporting charter schools, and opposed the LRAA. He initially opposed sick-leave legislation (Bowser and Schwartz consistently supported it) before later changing course and backing it. He is a self-styled \"maverick\" whose would bring a prickliness and combativeness to the mayoral suite that would pose a stark contrast to Gray's self-styled collegiality.\n\nSchwartz, who has been out of office since losing her re-election primary in 2008, compiled a fairly liberal record of the three on the Council, despite her Republican affiliation. She was strong on tenants' issues and was an early champion of requiring employers to provide sick leave for their workers — putting her at odds with Catania, who helped engineer her 2008 primary defeat.\n\nWhen Catania entered the race, he was looking forward to a head-to-head contest with a compromised Mayor Gray, who would have to fight ethics charges with one hand and electoral opposition with the other. Bowser's defeat of Gray in the Democratic primary has made Catania's path to victory much steeper, and Schwartz's entry has two prominent white ex-Republicans competing for the same limited pool of voters, while Bowser is running on the strengths of her being a member of the city's largest demographics – African-American and Democratic. Catania has even asserted that Schwartz entered the race on Bowser's behest to carve into his support, which both Bowser and Schwartz deny. Whether or not this is the case, Bowser has the wind at her back, and it's her race to lose.\n\n**At-Large Council **\n\nUnlike the mayor's race, the at-large Council race provides real choices for progressives. Under an oddity of DC election law, each biennial Council election includes races for two at-large seats, but no party may nominate more than one candidate in each election – effectively carving out a seat for a non-Democrat in this overwhelmingly Democratic city. Catania's decision to vacate the non-Democratic seat to run for mayor has attracted a large field of would-be successors.\n\nThe Democratic primary was won by incumbent Anita Bonds, who can be charitably described as an undistinguished party hack. (She initially voted for the LRAA but then changed sides and voted against overriding Mayor Gray's veto). However, no winner of a Democratic primary has ever lost a general election during the District's 40-year history of home rule, and Bonds is not expected to be the first.\n\nIt is the field of non-Democratic candidates that is generating the most heat. Most of the hopefuls are political newcomers with thin or nonexistent records, drawn to an election where a candidate could win one of the two seats with a tiny percentage of the vote. However, several candidates have established records and/or are running campaigns that raised hopes among progressives that the Council's center of gravity could be pushed to the left. These candidates are:\n\nGraylan Hagler (Independent) — The minister of Plymouth United Congregational Church of Christ is a long-time activist in progressive causes. He has worked with DSA on a number of projects and events, most recently on the 2010 jobs event at which he spoke and which was held in his church. Among the progressive organizations and causes he has worked with are United for Peace and Justice and the union UNITE HERE. He also has emphasized community empowerment, opposed attempts by Congress to impose a death penalty on DC, and opposed school vouchers. In 1991, before he moved to DC, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Boston.\n\nEugene Puryear (Statehood Green) — He's a younger candidate without much of a past in DC politics, but the Statehood Green Party is working hard for him to become the first candidate from their party to win a Council race since Hilda Mason. Puryear identifies as a socialist and is a member of the Party of Socialism and Liberation, whose outlook and history was summarized in [*DSA's guide to organizations*](http://dsadc.org/2014/05/) of the socialist left. Puryear was the 2008 PSL vice-presidential candidate and has been active in the antiwar ANSWER coalition. His website emphasizes a more progressive DC budget, tenants' rights, fairness for ex-prisoners and pursuit of DC statehood, as well as advocating a name change for Washington's football team and national issues such as the Iraq crisis and immigrant rights.\n\nElissa Silverman (Independent) — Silverman, a former journalist, ran unsuccessfully in the 2013 special election for Council, losing to Anita Bonds. She has built a profile as a favorite of DC's \"young progressives\" who are largely newcomers to the District, to the left on social and livability issues but far from united when it comes to economics and social justice. Her principal true \"progressive\" credential is being a leader of the unsuccessful effort to ban corporate contributions to DC election campaigns.\n\nMichael D. Brown (Independent) – Brown has been a DC Statehood (shadow) senator since 2006 and a strong advocate of statehood while lobbying Congress and promoting the cause outside of DC. Brown would be expected to use his council seat to continue to promote statehood. However, he doesn't have much of a record on other issues. He ran unsuccessfully against Phil Mendelson for the Democratic nomination for DC Council in 2010.\n\nWith the exception of Puryear, all of the above Council candidates were previously identified as Democrats, changing their registration to take advantage of the open seat reserved for non-Democrats.\n\nThe other at-large Council candidates qualifying for the ballot are less well-known: Republican Marc Morgan; Libertarian Frederick Steiner; and independents Wendell Felder, Calvin Gurley, Brian Hart, Eric Jones, Khalid Pitts, Kishan Putta, Courtney Snowden and Robert White.\n\n**Ward Councilmembers**\n\nIn addition to the at-large councilmembers, the District is divided into eight voting wards, each of which elects one councilmember. Four of the ward seats are on the ballot this year; the other four will next be up in 2016.\n\nIn all of the ward races, the winners of last April's Democratic primary have no opponents or at best token opposition. They are:\n\nWARD 1: Brianne Nadeau, a newcomer who defeated Jim Graham in the primary, mostly stressing ethics. She is largely a blank slate on other issues.\n\nWARD 3: Mary Cheh, incumbent. She has something of a mixed record. Significantly, she opposed the LRAA.\n\nWARD 5: Kenyon McDuffie, incumbent. McDuffie is running for his first full term after winning the special election to replace Harry Thomas Jr. He supported the LRAA, but otherwise his political profile is still being developed.\n\nWARD 6: Charles Allen, newcomer, a staffer for outgoing Councilmember Tommy Wells (Wells left his seat to run unsuccessfully for the nomination for mayor). Allen is expected to carry on Wells' record as a proponent of a livable, walkable city and a representative of \"young progressives\" (see description of Elissa Silverman, above).\n\n**Shadow Senator and Representative**\n\nIn addition to having an officially recognized delegate to Congress (currently Norton), the District elects two \"shadow senators\" to six-year terms and a \"shadow representative\" for a two-year term. The sole responsibility of these unpaid officials is to lobby Congress for DC statehood.\n\nThis year, one of the two shadow Senate races is on the ballot, with two-term incumbent Democrat Paul Strauss is being challenged by David Schwartzman of the Statehood Green Party. Strauss has been fairly visible, and has been mostly known for getting celebrities to endorse statehood. As the Democratic nominee, he is a prohibitive favorite to be re-elected. Schwartzman is a longtime Statehood Green activist and member of the socialist organization Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism, also described in [*DSA's guide to socialist organizations*](http://dsadc.org/2014/05/). He has been especially active in the DC Fair Budget Coalition, which advocates for greater spending by DC government on human needs and alleviating poverty. John Daniel, a Libertarian, is also running, as is Glenda Richmond, an independent.\n\nIn the race for Shadow Representative, Franklin Garcia, a first-time candidate, is the Democratic nominee and prohibitive favorite. He's president of the DC Latino Caucus and a party activist. No candidate ran in the Statehood Green primary, but afterwards the party selected Joyce Robinson-Paul for their slot on the ballot. She is a longtime statehood activist (she is currently vice president of the Stand Up! for Democracy in DC Coalition, a nonprofit organization that performs public education on DC statehood) and a former ANC commissioner. Mark Moulton, a Libertarian, is also running.\n\n**Attorney General**\n\nThis race was just added to the ballot and there was no primary. In 2010 DC voters chose to convert this office from an appointed post to an elected office beginning this year, but the DC Council tried to postpone the first election to 2018, claiming the duties of the office needed to be clarified. Attorney Paul Zukerberg, former DC Council candidate and advocate of marijuana decriminalization, led the successful court challenge to force the election to be held this year and, unsurprisingly, is himself running for the position and favored to win. The other candidates are Mark Tuohey and Edward Smith.\n\n**Council Chair and Delegate to Congress**\n\nRunning against the DSA-endorsed incumbent Phil Mendelson for Council Chair is Republican Kris Hammond and independent John Cheeks. Incumbent Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, also endorsed by DSA, is opposed by Republican Nelson Rimensnyder, Statehood Green Natale Lino Stracuzzi, Libertarian Sara Jane Panfil and independent Timothy Krepp. Neither's opposition is serious.\n\n**Ballot Initiative**\n\nIn addition to races for elective office, the November ballot will have an initiative that would legalize marijuana for recreational use in the District. This goes beyond a recent law that decriminalized (but did not fully legalize) marijuana. A 1998 initiative legalized marijuana for medical use in the District.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWith all of this action, the 2014 election in DC provides a seldom-seen opportunity for progressives to have an impact on the outcome, especially on the composition of the DC Council. Some elections force the left onto the sidelines; this one beckons us to become players.","order":2},{"title":"GOOD READS FOR SOCIALISTS on Labor Day 2014","date":"2014-09-01","issue":"September 2014","author":"","body":"From **Bill Mosley**: In his blog *Keep On Keepin' On*, Carl Davidson – co-chair of the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism – offers a new perspective on political alignment in U.S. politics. Where there is a formal two-party system, and many progressives see a \"one-party\" system – the party of big money that dominates both major parties – Davidson sees a \"six-party\" system representing tendencies from the Tea Party right to the progressive, social-democratic Left.

Paul Ryan (R-Wis), chairman of the House Budget Committee and former Republican candidate for vice-president, solving the problem of poverty in America can be simplified to the case of \"Andrea.\"\n\nSpeaking at the American Enterprise Institute in late July, Ryan spoke of 24-year-old Andrea, mother of two children, 2 and 4 years old, abandoned by her husband six months before we come across her. Andrea has a high school diploma, worked briefly behind the counter in retail, lives with her parents in a two-bedroom trailer and has been looking for work for five months without luck. She dreams of becoming a teacher.\n\nUnder the Ryan \"Opportunity Grant\" pilot program proposal he has begun to float around Washington, she would go to a service provider, which could be a nongovernment group, the welfare office or something else. Taking a page out of every known antipoverty intervention, she would sit down with a case manager and develop an \"opportunity plan\" specifying immediate, intermediate and long-term goals that would become part of a \"contract\" she would fulfill with some help. The deal comes with penalties and rewards built in.\n\n\"So she might find a job in retail to pay the bills. Meanwhile, her case manager would help pay for transportation and child care so she could take classes at night,\" Ryan explained. \"Over time, Andrea could go to school, get her certification and find a teaching job.\"\n\nEssentially, Ryan is proposing to help a typical welfare mother get her the master's degree needed to be a certified public school teacher in most states by doing in Congress nothing more than merging 11 existing programs and holding their funding flat. To their credit, his House panel's Republican staff filled in the picture somewhat more in their paper *Expanding Opportunity in America: A Discussion Draft*.\n\nUnder this plan, the Opportunity Grants pilot would include the billions from welfare, food assistance, and the never-fully-funded child development grants, several smaller housing programs pots, plus the few nickels from job training money. (*See full list at the bottom of this article*)\n\nThe proposed all-purpose block grant in the document is simple and in its broad intent remarkably similar to a plan proposed by AEI political scientist Charles Murray published in 2006 as *In Our Hands: A Plan to Replace Welfare*. However, the controversy-seeking Murray – whose 1994 work *The Bell Curve* essentially argued that ethnic minority Americans who are poor just happen to be unintelligent – proposed abolishing all social programs, including Social Security and Medicare, and replacing them with a universal cash grant.\n\nThe House Budget Committee GOP staff is more moderate than that. Indeed, in their paper they added to Andrea the case of \"Steven.\" Unlike Andrea, who is described as in \"Situational Poverty,\" Steven is in \"Generational Poverty.\"\n\nHe is 19 years old, the noncustodial father of a three-year-old he has not seen in \"over a year\" and lives with his 38-year-old mother and 55-year-old grandmother in a subsidized two-bedroom apartment, where he sleeps on the couch. Both his mother and grandmother were single parents, he does not know his father and his 20-year-old older brother is in prison. He dreams of going to college and getting joint custody of his child\n\n\"Steven faces much tougher circumstances,\" the paper states. \"He is struggling to avoid drugs, he doesn't have a high-school diploma, and worst of all, he can't rely on his family for support. Instead he will need to rely on others — preferably other people in his community who have overcome the same challenges.\"\n\nThe paper outlines an \"opportunity plan\" (the contract in Andrea's story) for Steven, but offers no happy ending, as Ryan did with Andrea.\n\nBut the paper is not merely a brochure about a proposal. The document devotes two-thirds of its pages to revisions to programs other than these, some 92 \"fragmented and formulaic\" programs, which per Ryan's assertions cost $800 billion annually to \"help struggling families\" and coexist with a poverty rate that is \"the highest in a generation.\" That last bit of stiletto-tongued innuendo is true if one does not count Baby Boomers; of course, he does not mention that the rate most recently began to rise under President George W. Bush.\n\nThe words \"block grant\" figure prominently in the Ryan plan for education, from Head Start to postsecondary aid, for which the paper proposes a mix of expansion (Pell Grants) and funding caps (financial aid), and for other areas.\n\nThe two words are a longstanding Republican legislative strategy: first, you merge everything you don't like; second, you block grant it (essentially passing the baby and its dirty diapers to the states), then you sit back as the states either go crazy trying to perform the redistributive federal functions or throw in the towel and the (Republican) governors simply refuse to take the money. Some creative state governments have even used block grants as general revenue substitutions: For example, in the 1990s, Virginia cut gasoline taxes and recovered the revenue by trimming federally funded welfare checks. It was all perfectly legal.\n\nThe Ryan plan did not emerge out of nowhere. It sprang from a series of June hearings and papers sponsored by Ryan's committee in the guise of celebrating the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty. Both policymakers and wonks seemed to be in a frenzy, like children before Christmas, to be the first to adorn the celebration of the half-century.\n\nThere was a minor problem. President Lyndon Johnson did indeed state before Congress, \"This administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America.\" But the date was Jan. 8, 1965. Fifty years from that will come next year.\n\nNever mind. In June 2014 the House Budget Committee held a hearing on the subject and the Brookings Institution issued 14 antipoverty proposals with explanatory essays, all complementing the House panel's own report and an economic evaluation of poverty by the National Bureau of Economic Research earlier this year. The material produced is voluminous, in large part repetitive of studies and political speeches of the last half century, and too unwieldy to summarize in one fell swoop.\n\nConsider instead two representative views.\n\n\"When poverty is measured in ways that take the War on Poverty programs into account, researchers find that they cut the poverty rate almost in half,\" said Olivia Golden, executive director of the liberal-leaning Center for Law and Social Policy, in her testimony before Ryan's panel. \"One recent estimate by researchers at Columbia University finds that government tax and transfer policies reduced the share of people who are poor by 13 percentage points, from 29 percent to 16 percent in 2012.\"\n\nShe acknowledged the drawbacks in reforms that she helped implement as HHS assistant secretary for children and families under President Clinton, but added, \"Unfortunately, however, changes in the economy, particularly in the availability of secure, decent-paying jobs and the nature of low-wage work, created an enormous headwind for public programs. Despite the accomplishments of the War on Poverty and the large increase in work effort by poor parents themselves, about one in five children remain(s) poor today.\"\n\nBefore and after her stint the federal government, Golden had specialized in administering welfare systems and she brought that perspective as she called on Congress to strengthen \"economic security for low-wage workers\" and help them \"move up on the job.\" Golden urged boosting child care and early childhood education to help parents stay on the job, improve access to Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps) and child care subsidies, strengthen the safety net for youth and childless adults and help families \"with less than $2 per person in household income per day.\"\n\nThe NBER report Golden cited was one of several papers by five specialists who analyzed poverty from the 1960s to the present.\n\nAuthors of one study said: \"We find that historical trends in poverty have been more favorable — and that government programs have played a larger role — than \\[the official poverty measure\\] estimates suggest. The OPM shows the overall poverty rates to be nearly the same in 1967 and 2012 — at 14 and 15 percent respectively.\" In *Waging War on Poverty: Historical Trends in Poverty Using the Supplemental Poverty Measure,* they continue: \"But our counterfactual estimates using SPM show that without government programs, poverty would have risen from 25 percent to 31 percent, while with government benefits poverty has fallen from 19 percent to 16 percent. Thus government programs today are cutting poverty nearly in half (from 31 percent to 16 percent) while in 1967 they cut poverty by only a quarter (from 25 percent to 19 percent).\"\n\nTake, in contrast, Jason Turner, currently executive director of the Secretaries' Innovation Group, a networking group for GOP state health and welfare cabinet members, who blamed \"the fix we are in\" with federal spending (meaning the deficit) on 79 \"welfare state\" federal means-tested programs.\n\n\"What have we gotten for all of that spending? The poverty rate fell sharply after World War II until it reached 12 percent in 1969,\" Turner asserted. \"Then, as the negative effects of dependency and other induced problems reduced labor participation and family cohesion, the rate in 2011 ended up higher than when the war on poverty began, at 15 percent.\"\n\n(According to the Census Bureau, the poverty rate fell to an all-time low of 11.1 percent in 1973, rose to 15.3 percent in 1983, declined to 11.3 percent in 2000 and in 2011 was 15.0 percent, down from a high of 15.1 percent the previous year.)\n\nTurner's perspective is easily explained by his curriculum vitae. He goes back to Ryan's home Badger State, whence he emerged from running Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson's Wisconsin Works welfare reduction program to become HHS director of family assistance under the elder President Bush. He was later New York City Commissioner of Human Resources — essentially the welfare programs chief — under Mayor Rudy Giuliani; there he was investigated several times concerning improprieties involving welfare contracts but was only once forced to admit a conflict of interest and accept a $6,500 fine. Now he counsels fellow Republicans on how to cut social spending.\n\nIn his testimony, Turner hailed the Clinton Administration's 1996 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program as a model. \"The adoption of TANF and the energy its reforms unleashed — adults newly finding and taking jobs, caseworkers oriented to work-first, time limits inducing urgency, and new program purposes such as the promotion of two parent families — is an example of how states can operate under the proper federal/state partnership,\" he testified.\n\nTANF reduced a federal entitlement for low-income families to a program dispensing aid for up to a five-year lifetime maximum, so long as the recipient makes bona fide efforts to work.\n\nAdmittedly, TANF did reduce what Republicans call \"dependence\" on welfare during what remained then of the 1990s economic boom, the longest and most broadly felt in U.S. history. TANF's record under the persistently depressed economy since the financial crash of 2008 is, incontrovertibly, that welfare rolls did not grow to match the swell of poverty and unemployment; scholars are still assessing whether the program itself is to blame.\n\nOverall, Ryan's plan offers nothing so ambitious as a major reform. Instead, an antipoverty experiment is pitched to deliver results that current programs cannot, using no more resources than present efforts receive. None of the palaver of Ryan's allies explains how the same old programs at the same level of underfunding will perform new miracles.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**List of programs Ryan would include in the \"Opportunity Grants\":**\n\n• Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\n\n• Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\n\n• Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program\n\n• Section 521 Rural Rental Assistance Payments\n\n• Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance\n\n• Public Housing Capital and Operating Funds\n\n• Child Care and Development Fund\n\n• Weatherization Assistance Program\n\n• Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program\n\n• Community Development Block Grant\n\n• Workforce Investment Act, Title II Dislocated Worker Program","order":4},{"title":"Is Economic Growth the Cure for the Jobs Gap? Or a \"Catch 22\" Setting Greens & Labor at Odds?","date":"2014-09-01","issue":"September 2014","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"As the U.S. and the world both struggle to recover from the lingering after-effects of the 2008 financial crisis, commentators from across the political spectrum are focusing a good deal on economic growth.\n\nAre today's growth rates fast enough to keep bringing down U.S. unemployment levels? How about fast enough to bolster federal income tax revenues, so the Obama administration can start to pay down the huge debts that Washington racked up a few years back to keep the financial crisis from leading to a full-fledged depression?\n\nIs the U.S. economy seeing enough growth this year, and enough job creation with it, that the Federal Reserve Board can safely end its \"qualitative easing\" policy that was largely designed to fend off another recession by slightly inflating the currency each year? Will the Fed now feel confident enough of healthy growth that it will soon begin raising short-term interest rates again, so as to slightly reduce the growth rate and new job creation to keep workers from growing so secure that that we demand big pay increases that will spark serious inflation?\n\nIn terms of the troubled economies of the Eurozone, is economic growth starting to return to Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, all of which were pushed into recession by a flap over government debts, and all of which have been pressured by European bankers to adopt austerity policies that have generated high unemployment and sometimes violent street protests, not to mention rightwing political backlash?\n\nThe usual experts quoted by the capitalist media sometimes disagree on how to measure economic growth, not to mention how best to promote it. But the vast majority, and many labor leaders and political progressives who do not always get media exposure, agree that economic growth is not only good, but essential for achieving economic health and long-term political progress in our system. Most economists are especially insistent that growth, or at least the right kind of growth, is especially crucial for organized and unorganized labor. When healthy growth is occurring, they agree, jobs are usually more plentiful, consumers are more optimistic and likely to buy things, which helps support the creation of new jobs, employers tend to be a little more generous, and voters and politicians are kinder towards the poor.\n\n\"A rising tide lifts all boats,\" is how John F. Kennedy put it, and a large majority of this society's labor economists agree.\n\nFrom one admittedly radical Green perspective, however, the capitalist West's near-worship of economic growth is tragically, suicidally wrong. The radical Green logic here is simple – if not simplistic, which is what some critics say about it.\n\nThe earth, the atmosphere and the biosphere of living things that earth and atmosphere support are all, according to this viewpoint, parts of a single physical system. That physical system is big, and has been capable of supporting a great deal of human endeavor to date, but it is finite.\n\nGreen radical logic says that by definition, no constituent element within a finite system, regardless of how big the system may be, can grow in size indefinitely without eventually bursting the system's boundaries – probably fatally. As the controversial environmentalist Paul Ehrlich once wrote, from a Green viewpoint, \"The belief in endless growth is the ideology of a cancer cell.\"\n\nSome 40 years ago, in its highly publicized *Limits to Growth* report, a think tank called the Club of Rome argued that both the population growth rates and the economic growth rates that prevailed around the world in the early 1970s were environmentally unsustainable, and the report cited a computer simulation indicating that the continuation of such growth rates in world economic output and human population would trigger serious disasters by the close of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Critics questioned the validity of the computer simulation at the time, and some of the report's gloomiest predictions turned out to be wrong.\n\nBut from the perspective of some Green radicals today, the growing scientific concern about global climate change is an indication that the basic logic of the *Limits to Growth* report was valid. Human civilization's apparent inability or unwillingness to place limits on both economic and population growth, they argue, is not only feeding dangerous climate change. Growth of various kinds also drives forward the ongoing destruction of tropical rain forests, among the most genetically diverse environments on the planet. Growth, at least the wrong kind of growth, also is generating the depletion of major ocean fisheries, the creation of \"dead zones\" in the ocean caused by excessive agricultural runoff, the destruction of productive farmland, the contamination of important food chains and the fatty tissues of many human beings by long-lasting chemical wastes, and what evolutionary biologists call the \"[*Sixth Extinction Event*](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/02/140218-kolbert-book-extinction-climate-science-amazon-rain-forest-wilderness/),\" a spasm of extinctions of plant and animal species during our lifetimes that promises to rival the one that ended the dinosaur age in 65 million B.C.\n\nSooner or later, the Green radicals argue, our society and all other societies on the planet have to move from a growth-dependent economy to a \"steady state\" or no-growth economy, in which humanity's total physical impact on the natural world will not increase but remain roughly constant from year to year.\n\nYet modern capitalism since its origins in the British Industrial Revolution of the late 1700s and early 1800s has essentially been a system devoted to infinitely prolonged growth. Adam Smith, the intellectual founder of capitalist political economy and the thinker who coined the phrase \"the invisible hand of the market\" for the delight of future libertarians, explained some of the reasons for this in his masterwork *The Wealth of Nations.* In that book, Smith noted that continuing economic growth is quite beneficial for private investors and business owners, for in a steady-state or non-growing economy, he argued, profits would fall to a very low level. But he thought that growth was even more important for the working class. Why?\n\nIn primitive economies with little or no division of labor and no class divisions, Smith reasoned, \"the whole produce of labour belongs to the labourer. He has neither landlord nor master to share with him.\" But this state of affairs, to Smith, \"could not last beyond the first introduction of the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock.\" In other words, it was incompatible with modern private property.\n\nIn advanced market societies that rest on private property, Smith observed that landlords demand a share of almost everything that is produced from their lands in the form of rent. Also, \"In all arts and manufactures the greater part of the workmen stand in need of a master to advanced them the materials of their work, and their wages and maintenance until it be completed. He shares in the produce of their labour ... and in this share consists his profit.\"\n\nIn the basically pro-capitalist analysis of Adam Smith, it followed that in advanced market societies, the average wages of labor are determined everywhere by a \"contract usually made between ... two parties, whose interests are by no means the same. The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as little as possible.\" Moreover, Smith thought, \"It is not ... difficult to foresee which of the two parties, must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms.\"\n\nBecause employers are usually fewer in number than workers, they can generally organize more easily to present a united front against wage increases. They also are generally richer than the workers, and can withstand the economic pain of a strike or work stoppage longer than most workers can. To Smith, it followed that employers generally can force workers to accept wages that are barely adequate to keep the workers themselves alive, and to raise families of future employees who will one day go to work for the employers. Below this minimal level, Smith thought, wages usually do not fall.\n\nYet there are \"certain circumstances,\" Smith wrote, \"which sometimes give the laborers an advantage and enable them to raise their wages considerably above this rate, evidently the lowest which is consistent with common humanity.\" When demand for labor exceeds the available supply, market forces will allow its price to rise, and in Smith's view, this can only occur under conditions of rapid growth. As he put it, \"The demand for those who live by wages ... necessarily increases with the increase of the revenue and stock of every country, and cannot possibly increase without it.\" Thus \"It is not the actual greatness of national wealth, but its continual increase, which occasions a rise in the wages of labour. It is not ... in the richest countries, but in the most thriving, or in those which are growing the fastest, that the wages of labour are highest.\"\n\nFor Smith, accordingly, \"The liberal reward of labour ... is the natural symptom of increasing national wealth. The scanty maintenance of the labouring poor, on the other hand, is the natural symptom that things are at a stand\\[still\\], and their starving condition, that they are going backward.\" And since the \"labouring poor\" were the vast majority of the population in every society, Smith concluded, it is only the rapidly growing capitalist market society – or what he called the \"progressive\" society – that can offer a good life to most of its people.\n\nToday's apologists for unregulated capitalism don't seem to cite *The Wealth of Nations* quite as frequently as they did in the 1950s, perhaps because many conservatives have grown more aware of Smith's almost proto-Marxist thinking about how working people can normally be exploited by private landlords and capitalist employers. However, it's clear that Smith's ideas about the capitalist job market and the effects of economic growth on it still apply to contemporary market societies.\n\nThis is one reason that liberal Democratic politicians who rely on the support of organized labor, and some who merely give lip service to labor, regularly promise to \"grow this economy,\" and why Keynesian economists such as Paul Krugman sometimes call for higher deficit spending to spur economic growth in hopes that in the long run, reinvigorated growth will allow the U.S. government to expand its way out of its \\[hopefully temporary\\] debt problems.\n\nToday, just as in Smith's time, average wages are determined by contracts made \"between two parties, whose interests are by no means the same,\" and today in the U.S. just as in 18<sup>th</sup> century Scotland, advocates for working class interests generally call for faster growth to give employees some advantage in negotiating with capitalists over pay. Whenever growth stops, whenever the increase in total U.S. output of income and investment capital reaches a \"stand,\" as Smith would have it, professional economists declare our economy is in recession, and labor economists predict that if the recession continues, job creation and wages both will fall.\n\nIt naturally follows that virtually all politicians, labor leaders, mainstream economists and media commentators in our society think further U.S. economic growth is necessary. They probably do not say this because of the low output of our system. The U.S. last year had a Gross Domestic Product of $15.92 trillion, according to the government's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In constant dollars, adjusted for inflation, the nation's GDP in 1972 when *Limits to Growth* first appeared was roughly $5.25 trillion. In short, our national economic output, already high compared to that of the rest of the world in the 1970s, has apparently tripled in the last 42 years.\n\nYet as Adam Smith put it, it is not the total wealth of any capitalist market economy that determines whether members of the \"working poor\" are paid adequately. It is how fast the economy is growing. Last year the Bureau of Economic Analysis recorded a growth rate in GDP of just 1.9 percent, which almost everyone agrees was inadequate to spur healthy job growth and decent pay for all Americans. So presumably, our $15.9 trillion economy, after expanding threefold over the past 40 years, now needs to grow faster than an average rate of 1.9 percent annually for indefinitely far into the future, if we want conditions for working people to improve. Presumably, our national GDP must double to – say — $31 trillion a year in another 40 years and double again to $62 trillion or so before 2100, to keep jobs available and wages at decent levels for all.\n\nWhen radical Greens object that such economic expansion is almost certain to be environmentally disastrous, accordingly, advocates for continued growth usually simply ignore them. Sometimes, when the \"no growthers\" are too loud to be ignored, as they were in the early 1970s, advocates for growth criticize the alleged alarmism of the Greens, their alleged class biases, and their imperfect research methods. Judging from the failure of some of the Club of Rome's 1972 computer predictions, it should be admitted that some anti-Green criticisms, at some times, have been at least partly valid.\n\nBut at least in this society, the real problem with \"steady state\" or \"no-growth\" economics is not primarily that its advocates are methodologically careless or committed to supposedly elitist values that privilege tree-hugging at the expense of human welfare. The fundamental problem with no-growth environmentalism in the United States is that it appears incompatible with capitalism, and capitalism is the political coin of the realm.\n\nCan democratic socialists inside or outside of DSA have any useful contributions to make to debates over \"growth\" versus \"no growth\" economics? Can we prevent open or hidden conflicts over the desirability of growth from driving destructive political wedges between the Green groups and organized labor? Can we find ways to work for a future in which the U.S. economy does not need to embrace serious environmental risks to prevent poverty from worsening? Maybe, but maybe not.\n\nIn 1974, in a book of interviews with prominent thinkers on reactions to the *Limits to Growth* report, the great Marxist economist Ernest Mandel, a member of the Trotskyist Fourth International, reported \"an impression of satisfaction and an impression of irritation\" with the Club of Rome's findings. Some solutions the report's authors had proposed would be worse than the problems they hoped to cure, Mandel stated, but he basically agreed that \"capitalist economic growth threatens human survival.\"\n\nSimilarly, U.S. anarchist Noam Chomsky told interviewer Willem Oltmans that without commenting on the accuracy of the Club of Rome's computer model, he agreed that physical and chemical laws would eventually set some limits to capitalist growth in the U.S. at some stage in the future, and \"probably not a very distant stage.\" The Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse, an inspiration to many New Left radicals during the 1960s, declared that *Limits to Growth* \"shows from a new angle the destructiveness and aggressiveness which is inherent in the capitalist system.\"\n\nYet democratic socialist Michael Harrington, who would later help found DSA, told Oltmans that \"if the projections of the Club of Rome study are true, then it seems to me socialism becomes an impossibility.\" Harrington explained that socialists have traditionally believed that many of capitalism's worst features arise from competition over scarce resources, and \"the problem of the *Limits to Growth* hypothesis is that if it is true, then one has removed permanently the possibility of abolishing that fundamental scarcity which is at the root of so many of the basic human emotions.\"\n\nBesides that, Harrington added, he basically believed that the future is impossible to predict, and given the impossibility of prediction, he felt compelled to be an optimist about it. He therefore opposed the \"no growth\" position, and he continued to do so until his death in 1989.\n\nToday scientific warnings about climate crisis appear to have persuaded a sizeable number of people on the U.S. left that Marcuse, Mandel and Chomsky were right about capitalism's environmental destructiveness, but there are probably large numbers of progressives within DSA and the U.S. labor movement, particularly, who still embrace Harrington's position – and Adam Smith's – about the importance of economic growth to human welfare in our society.\n\nOne possible short- to medium-term way for progressives to finesse this divide rests on advocating for new definitions of growth and new technological methods for achieving it. If the U.S. and world economies can switch from dirtier, more resource-intensive industrial methods to cleaner, more environmentally frugal and environmentally sustainable ones, for example, economic growth can continue for some time, even in a capitalist context, without necessarily triggering eco-disaster.\n\nThis is the logic behind the Green Party's 2012 call for a \"Green New Deal\" and is being proposed in a more economically mainstream form by would-be \"green capitalists\" and entrepreneurs who propose to reinvigorate the U.S. economy through private investments in renewable energy and conservation. It is also the course advocated by some business economists who argue that through technological innovation, capitalism already is developing new and more efficient ways to use resources to create economic value and generate profits, supposedly without too many nasty side effects.\n\nA second possibility suggested by Marx in the third volume of *Capital*, and echoed within the last few generations by the French anarchist Andre Gorz and by some U.S. radicals, is to weaken the links among growth, job creation and wages by legislating a radical reduction in the average work week. The goal would be to reduce the economy's physical impact on nature by stabilizing both output and resource use, but to prevent higher unemployment and wage losses by distributing work, leisure and income more equally in the economy. Historically, the demand for a shorter work week was central to U.S. labor radicalism in the late 1800s and into the 20th century, although it was eclipsed within the mainstream labor movement following World War II. Today, labor radicals might find common cause with environmentalists by working to revive the notion, this time with a Green twist.\n\nA third possibility suggested by Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations* is to change the capitalist labor market so that growth is no longer a precondition for higher wages. How? If worker-owned and worker-controlled enterprises could eliminate the role of private employers in production, say, so that every working person reaped the full economic value created by his or her labor, without needing to share it with a landlord or a capitalist boss, wages would no longer be set by \"a contract between two parties, whose interests are by no means the same.\" Then the scarcity or non-scarcity of labor, and with it the rate of growth, might cease to have much effect on average incomes, and working people might prosper even when growth slows or ceases entirely.\n\nDavid Schweickart, author of *After Capitalism*, has suggested something like this arrangement in his plans for a system of \"economic democracy\" or market socialism characterized by widespread worker ownership and worker control over production. Leftist economist Gar Alperovitz has implicitly proposed something rather similar in several recent books on the importance of worker-owned enterprises, producer coops and other alternative business models in the place of today's capitalist workplaces.\n\nIn order to avoid debates over growth becoming a chronic \"Catch-22\" problem for the left, in which progressives cannot embrace the labor movement's goals without alienating the Green groups and vice versa, DSA members might want to spend some time studying these potential part-solutions to the growth dilemma.\n\nMeanwhile, we can undoubtedly expect conflicts over growth to continue. Thomas Picketty's best-selling new book on inequality actually identifies the expected slow growth of all the developed capitalist economies in the future as a key factor that he believes will make inequality ever worse. In the U.S. economy at this writing, meanwhile, the nation's fastest economic growth and job creation is probably occurring around the shale oil deposits of North Dakota, as well as through the production of natural gas through \"fracking.\"\n\nSome readers of Picketty's work are sure to argue that faster growth is the best or the only way to raise U.S wage levels in the near future, while the CO2 emissions and water pollution associated with fracking and shale oil production seem likely guarantee that for the next generation, as in the past, a great deal of U.S. economic growth will be associated with severe environmental destruction. Can democratic socialists help organize a movement to do something about this?\n\n\n\n[*Is the Recession Over Yet? Four Left Visions of What Comes Next for American Labor*](http://dsadc.org/is-the-recession-over-yet-four-left-visions-of-what-comes-next-for-american-labor/)\n\nMonday, September 1st, 2014\n\n**By Andy Feeney**\n\n&gt;&gt;Greg Albo, Sam Gindin and Leo Panitch, *In and Out of Crisis: The Global Financial Meltdown and Left Alternatives* (2010, Spectre/PM Press, Oakland, Calif., $13.95), 140 pp.\n\n&gt;&gt;David McNally, *Global Slump: The Economics and Politics of Crisis and Resistance* (2011, Spectre/PM Press, Oakland, $17.00), 230 pp.\n\n&gt;&gt;Jeff Faux, *The Servant Economy: Where America's Elite Is Sending the Middle Class* (2011, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, N.J., $27.95), 298 pp.\n\n**&gt;&gt;**John Bellamy Foster and Robert McChesney, *The Endless Crisis: How Monopoly- Finance Capital Produces Stagnation and Upheaval from the USA to China* (2013, Monthly Review Press, New York, $25.00), 320 pp.\n\nThis year's media attention to Thomas Piketty's *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* has put an official stamp on some bad news long familiar to democratic socialists: income equality in the U.S. and other western market societies is growing and has worsened significantly since the 1970s. Meanwhile, the U.S. labor movement is embattled and has lost political influence over the past half-century. Unemployment is still at near-crisis levels in Europe and is a serious social problem in our society, although Democrats campaigning for reelection and some Republicans, too, may try to pretend otherwise. And six years after the global financial crisis of 2008, which had many in Washington and on Wall Street worried about a possible collapse of the entire banking system, economic growth in the U.S. and elsewhere is still precarious, although the Obama White House and Janet Yellen of the Federal Reserve Board are beginning to sound cautiously optimistic about it.\n\nAs progressive activists ponder these trends and what they might mean, what does the capitalist system have in store for labor in the coming years? No one knows for sure, of course: as *New York Times* economics writer Leonard Silk once observed, capitalism as a system is a \"moving target\" whose dynamism and flexibility have often surprised both critics and supporters in the past. The current cult of \"disruptive\" innovation in the high-technology sector along with business enthusiasm for what Joseph Schumpeter called \"creative destruction\" make prediction even harder than it might be otherwise.\n\nOn the progressive U.S. left, however, and to a large extent within DSA, there seems to be a view emerging that pins many of the problems now plaguing American working people on \"neoliberalism,\" the anti-Keynesian free-market fundamentalism that powerful corporations and members of the economic elite have been promoting for decades now. The biggest problem that working class and/or \"middle class\" Americans face today is not that capitalism has turned into a \"winner-take-all economy,\" this school of thought contends; the main problem is what political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson have called \"Winner-Take-All Politics.\" Both major political parties have been capturedin part or whole by wealthy corporate campaign donors since the 1970s, and they have succeeded in pushing Washington to adopt anti-egalitarian policies – tax cuts for billionaires, huge Pentagon budgets, painful cuts in social spending, weak enforcement of labor laws and deregulation of finance – that privilege billionaires at the expense of the rest of us.\n\nEducate most Americans about neoliberal \"winner-take-all politics\" and mobilize them to demand change, the theory goes, and with an admittedly huge expenditure of effort, members of the U.S. middle class/working class may be able to resurrect at least some of the key features of the so-called \"golden age\" of U.S. capitalism, between 1946 and 1971, when income was better distributed, unions were stronger, and Keynesian fiscal policies helped the government head off recessions before they got really serious.\n\nThere are at least a few dissenters on the left, however, who argue that a progressive focus on fighting \"winner-take-all politics\" and neoliberalism, although essential, is too optimistic concerning the inner dynamics of capitalism. The four books addressed in this review are largely written from this more pessimistic perspective, although one – *The Servant Economy,* by Jeff Faux, a founder of the Economic Policy Institute – actually supports what many optimistic progressives think needs to be done. Like the optimists, Faux focuses his analysis on the sins of the neoliberal rich, but he differs from some other progressives in the bleak outlook and the barely concealed anger he brings to the discussion.\n\nIt is impossible in this review to offer a really comprehensive account of any the four books mentioned here. But for DSA members interested in doing more reading on the subject of economic crisis and its possible cures, here are some highlights of what the different authors say on the subject.\n\nFaux, in *The Servant Economy,* offers the least \"Marxist\" account of how U.S. capitalism has evolved (and devolved) over the past 150 years or so. One of his central points is that U.S. economic success since the early 1800s has depended heavily on the system of protective tariffs that Alexander Hamilton invented for the purpose of shielding \"infant industries\" from ruinous foreign competition. The increasing abandonment of protective tariffs in favor of global free trade, notably by a surprisingly coalition of Bill Clinton's White House and the Republicans in the 1990s, is a key to why this nation's working class is now facing hard times, in Faux's view.\n\nDespite the economic growth facilitated by the tariff, Faux acknowledges, the U.S. economy suffered through several major economic crises and some bitter class wars in the 60 or 70 years leading up to the start of the 1929 Depression. However, the progressive economic programs of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, followed by the temporary destruction of most foreign competition to U.S. industry thanks to World War II's impacts on Western Europe and Japan, then set the stage for the \"golden age\" economy of 1946-1971. The creation of the Bretton Woods system in the late 1940s, which stabilized global trade patterns and currency values by turning the U.S. dollar into a global currency, with a guarantee that foreign holders of dollars could redeem them from the U.S. Treasury at the stated value of $35 per ounce of gold, further supported general prosperity.\n\nUltimately, though, the Europeans and Japanese rebuilt their industrial economies and began to challenge U.S. dominance in major world markets again. Meanwhile Lyndon Johnson's refusal in the 1960s to raise taxes to pay for the Great Society and the Vietnam War had the effect of reintroducing serious inflation into the economy. Inflation plus an increasing flow of U.S. investments overseas led foreigners who were accumulating large numbers of dollars to try to redeem them at Fort Knox, thus threatening to deplete the entire U.S. gold supply and trigger disaster.\n\nTo head off that risk, Faux writes, Richard Nixon in 1971 abrogated the Bretton Wood Agreement by ending the convertibility of dollars to gold and allowed the dollar to \"float\" on global currency markets. This saved the U.S. from a gold-related default, but at the cost of encouraging renewed speculation in national currencies and supporting the growth of an increasing large volume of financial speculation in derivative securities that helped businesses and governments to hedge against currency risks. The decoupling of dollars, the main currency used to purchase Middle Eastern petroleum, also triggered the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise the dollar prices of oil dramatically, triggering two separate \"oil shocks\" in the 1970s that further destabilized the world economy.\n\nFaux's analysis of the last 30 years is rather complicated, but he makes two or three main points about how the U.S. government responded to the crises of the 1970s that together support his charge that the U.S. elite today is in fact betraying the middle class/working class to neoliberal austerity politics and untrammeled globalism. Unless Americans mobilize to prevent this, he contends, neoliberalism and globalism together will condemn most of us to lives in a \"servant economy,\" as well-paid or badly paid servants to the globally minded rich.\n\nFirst, Faux argues, the U.S. political elite decided after some debate not to meet the economic challenges of the 1970s through the creation of a national industrial policy, as some progressive Democrats urged at the time, and opted instead to rely on market forces to determine which industries would live or die. Secondly, the U.S. Federal Reserve took strong action to end inflation in the early 1980s by triggering a deep global recession and putting millions of Americans out of work, thus drastically weakening organized labor. The Reagan administration, by brutally breaking the Professional Air Traffic Controllers' strike in 1981, then signaled to corporate employers that they could take strong anti-union actions without much concern for prevailing labor laws, further weakening labor.\n\nLarge national debts that the Reagan administration incurred in the 1980s meanwhile undercut the financial foundation of the New Deal welfare state, and then in 1994 Bill Clinton joined with corporate America and pro-business Republicans to push through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which helped end the tradition of Hamiltonian tariff walls that had protected U.S. industrial jobs for more than a century.\n\nThere are more economic misdeeds that Faux attributes to mainstream U.S. political leaders over the past generation, too, but these are some of the key ones.\n\nUnderlying most of these bad economic decisions, he argues, is one central flaw: the growing domination of our national politics by big money. Although Faux in his closing arguments states that overall, the Democrats are still mostly better for labor and the middle class than Republicans, he sees Obama and Clinton as well as their Republican rivals as all carrying out the wishes of the economic elite, especially on Wall Street. Indeed, he writes, proving one is willing to serve the elite at the expense of ordinary Americans, if necessary, has probably become an essential qualification of being elected to the White House.\n\n*The Servant Economy* therefore ends with a call to U.S. progressives to focus on one objective above all others: amending the U.S. Constitution to end the Supreme Court's treatment of large corporations as \"persons\" under the law, as demonstrated recently in the Citizens United and Hobby Lobby cases. The political process of amending the Constitution, especially against the wishes of the establishment, is enormously\n\ndifficult, Faux writes, but it is the only reform that can save us from a future as lackeys to the global elite. He adds that if progressives can organize for a constitutional amendment intelligently, we will probably win a good fraction of the Tea Party's supporters to our cause.\n\nUnlike Faux, the Canadian labor economists Greg Albo, Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin are open socialists and Marxists. In their book *In and Out of Crisis* they agree that the roots of our current labor market problems are political as well as economic. However, one striking feature of their analysis is they do not identify neoliberal politics with \"free market\" extremism alone, and they reject the arguments of some left-liberal commentators who seem to believe that one problem with the U.S. is that the political state here is \"weak\" as compared with the governments, say, of the social democratic nations of Europe. Corporate neoliberalism actually requires a strong political state, they write, but one that privileges elite interests over all others.\n\nThey also reject what they see as an irresponsible and \"populist\" tendency by North American politicians and some progressives to blame all economic problems on the financial sector. The financial sector did trigger the global crisis of 2008, this book notes, but the financial sector has always been an essential feature of industrial capitalism; it is not just a parasitic outgrowth that has emerged since the 1970s to cannibalize the \"real\" economy. Moreover, it was the financial sector that offered working people an apparent way out of the crisis of the 1970s and the massive losses of industrial jobs that have occurred in the early to mid-1990s. As working people lost good jobs and decent pay, the book reports, many have turned to financial products – credit card debt, speculation on securities during the \"dot.com bubble\" of the 1990s, and more recently home equity lines of credit and the refinancing of home mortgages – as the best way to maintain their incomes and their families in very hard times.\n\nAccordingly, Albo, Gindin and Panitch see U.S. and Canadian workers as being increasingly entangled with the financial industry, which limits real political support for populist campaigns to punish \"evil bankers.\" Indeed, \"The American Dream has always materially entailed promoting the integration of the popular classes into the circuits of commodity capital\" – whether as indebted farmers demanding free coinage of silver, as industrial workers with paychecks deposited in banks and old-age pensions dependent on the stock market, as consumers running up credit card debt, or as homeowners trying to stay afloat through home equity loans and subprime mortgages.\n\nToo often in the past, this book adds, North American progressives have cemented working class incorporation into the financial economy by employing the \"democratic\" state to improve popular access to credit – a strategy that has indirectly bolstered the neoliberal order. To respond to the aftermath of the 2008 crisis and build a better foundation for the left, the authors offer a handful of brief suggestions for an alternative politics. One of their recommendations is a major push to nationalize the banks, or create new publicly-owned ones, rather than calling on an elitist-dominated state to improve regulation of the private banking sector that now exists.\n\nIn *Global Slump: The Economics and Politics of Crisis and Resistance,* Canadian political scientist David McNally argues that neoliberalism, despite its elitist biases and its painful effects on working people, is not simply a pathology: instead, McNally contends, it offered capitalism an apparent solution to the economic crisis of the 1970s, which is why it initially won such support. Beginning in around 1980, it supported a 25-year wave of new economic growth – the achievement of the Reagan and Thatcher years. But the financial crisis of 2008 has signaled the end of that capitalist growth wave and \"the transition to a protracted period of slump.\" The crisis triggered by the 2008 financial meltdown continues still, McNally adds, despite claims by politicians, business leaders and the mainstream media that the world economy is now on a path to renewed prosperity.\n\n\n\nThe prolonged period of austerity politics that lies ahead, McNally writes, will be characterized by \"a new period of social conflict and class struggle. For our planet's rulers, this conflict takes the form of a war against indigenous lands, public services, unions, and communities of color. For the world's workers, it is expressed in factory occupations, general strikes, land seizures, street protests, and mass demonstrations for migrant justice.\"\n\nMcNally's economic analysis, which reflects some traditional Marxist concepts about the inevitability of capitalist business crises and how they are resolved, is not easy to summarize. But essentially, he rejects what some left-liberal labor economists in the United States have written about the Keynesian idea of governments running up large debts in times of crisis so as to \"jump start\" stalled economies, then relying on renewed growth and improved tax collections to pay down the debts later. Following the 2008 financial crisis, McNally argues, capitalist governments, especially in the Eurozone, rescued failing banks by taking on enormous levels of debt that are unsustainable.\n\nTo shrink the debts and insure continuing corporate profits despite the cost of doing so, he believes capitalist governments will be compelled to wage a vicious war against the working class and the poor. The leftwing response must be insurrectionary or nearly so – the building of a \"culture of resistance\" that will do battle against the austerity and privatization drive of capital, from street demonstrations against job losses and pension cuts in Greece, to factory takeovers in Chicago, to \"intransigent\" fights against racism, to militant anti-globalization protests in Toronto and Bolivian campaigns against the privatization of public water systems. Citing the revolutionary legacy of Rosa Luxemburg, McNally writes that socialists who help to link together such fights will embody \"the conviction that we are mobilizing ... to create something new – a vigorous, dynamic movement of opposition to capitalism and all its multiple oppressions.\"\n\nIn *The Endless Crisis,* John Bellamy Foster and Robert McChesney focus far less on activist responses to capitalist crisis, far more on plumbing its dimensions from the perspective of the \"monopoly capital\" school of Marxism associated with the journal *Monthly Review. *Their conclusions are implicitly as pro-revolutionary as McNally's, but their account of how capitalist crisis has evolved since the 1960s is radically different. This book is a relatively scholarly exploration of the monopoly capitalism theory, complete with footnotes to a host of different leftwing and some rightwing authorities – e.g. Milton Friedman.\n\nOne common Marxist explanation for economic crisis is that it results from a \"tendency\" for the rate of corporate profits to fall over time, basically in response to business competition reducing the proportion of labor employed in production, as opposed to machinery and other forms of investment capital. When profit rates fall far enough – as McNally and many other Marxists argue they did in the mid-1970s – capitalism goes into crisis, which invariably entails large-scale job losses and falling wages and usually ends with workers being exploited more intensively than before.\n\nThe theory of monopoly capital, though, is that economic crisis today results from too many corporate profits, not too few. The development of enormous global corporations in the place of the more competitive small businesses of 19<sup>th</sup> century capitalism, the theory asserts, has reduced or at least radically altered competition among corporations. They no longer compete through price-cutting, but through advertising, marketing and the creation of planned waste in the economy to absorb surplus production capacity. The oligopoly structure of the market and the avoidance of price-cutting mean that even in times of recession, corporate profits for large firms remain high. However, this then leads to a crisis of \"over-accumulation\" – investors have too much capital on hand and too few profitable outlets for it.\n\nAccording to Foster and McChesney, this over-accumulation crisis is the root of the massive \"financialization\" of U.S. and arguably the world economy since the 1980s. With huge sums of investment capital on hand and existing surplus capacity in the economy making new investments in commodity production unattractive, capitalist money managers have turned instead to financial speculation – to gambling on asset prices – as the best use for the money. This process has generated a series of financial crises and a chronic problem of economic stagnation in western economies since Reagan's time, *The Endless Crisis* argues, and the recent appearance of industrial over-capacity in China, too, suggests that the entire world now faces a prolonged slump.\n\n\n\nEnormously adding to the woes of working people everywhere, meanwhile, is the recent incorporation of tens of millions of poor Chinese peasants and millions of displaced African and Latin American peasants into the global working class. Along with the 1989 collapse of the Soviet Union, which soon led to Western investors being able to penetrate Eastern Europe, the ongoing proletarianization of the global South and the flow of Western corporate investment to Asia have enormously expanded what Marx called \"the reserve army of the unemployed\" – the pool of unemployed workers that employers can now call on to \"discipline\" the old industrial working class of the West through the threat of worldwide competition for jobs.\n\n\n\nThe long-term implications for workers everywhere, and not just in the West, are potentially disastrous, Foster and McChesney indicate, and leftists need to mobilize a vigorous political movement to meet the challenge. Far more than Faux, Albo, Gindin and Panitch do in their respective analyses of the present crisis, Foster and McChesney imply that to succeed, that politicized labor movement will need to be global in scope.\n\nUnfortunately, Foster and McChesney offer few guidelines on how such a movement might be built. But by broadening the scope of how socialists and labor activists need to think about current capitalist trends, *The Endless Crisis* along with the other books may help organizers develop practical strategies for addressing the slump in years to come.","order":5},{"title":"Labor Day's Forgotten Roots","date":"2014-09-01","issue":"September 2014","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"Labor Day, like other holidays and traditions in the United States, has largely been stripped of its content over the years. Often ignored except as the last summer holiday weekend, perhaps most people no longer recall its connection to the trade union movement. Where rallies and parades are held, they are generally no more than occasions for politicians to salute those who work without speaking to the need for changes in law and public policy to restore labor rights, promote social insurance, and establish \"jobs for all,\" economic policies. Exceptions exist, of course, but fewer and fewer, the exhaustion of the labor movement after decades of losses making it harder to use the day as reason to celebrate, making it harder to use the day to mobilize for militant action.\n\nPerhaps this is only natural, for Labor Day itself has an ambiguous history, having been used to divert support from the working-class radicalism and international solidarity associated with May 1<sup>st</sup>. That shift took place during the 1950s, because May Day's association with Communists made it suspect during the McCarthy era (an association all the more disturbing to the Red-baiters because its roots – just as with March 8<sup>th</sup> International Women's Day's roots – lay in class struggles that took place in the United States). Our history, however, has not only erased May Day traditions from our collective memory; it has also erased the true legacy of Labor Day. For it too was initiated by socialist trade unionists and conceived as a means of militant demonstration against a rapacious capitalist class that seemed to know no bounds or limits in the push to expand and exploit. A popular 1880s poem about railroad robber baron Jay Gould (who famously claimed that he could hire half the working-class to kill the other half) gives some idea of the prevailing mood:\n\n\n\n*Jay Gould's Modest Wants*\n\n**\n\n\"My wants are few; I scorn to be\n\nA querulous refiner;\n\nI only want America\n\nAnd a mortgage deed of China;\n\nAnd if kind fate threw Europe in,\n\nAnd Africa and Asia,\n\nAnd a few islands of the sea,\n\nI'd ask no other treasure\n\nGive me but these – they are enough\n\nTo suit my notion –\n\nAnd I'll give to other men\n\nAll land beneath the ocean.\"\n\n\n\nIt was against this background that Peter J. McGuire – General Secretary of the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and a leader of the Socialist Labor Party – proposed to the New York Central Labor Union in New York in 1882 that a day be set aside in early September for workers to show their strength through public rallies. Slogans issued in the marches held those first years show the issues which most concerned unionists of the time. These included \"We must crush the monopolies lest they crush us,\" \"Strike with the Ballot,\" and \"Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, and eight hours for what we will.\" This last reflected the focus on the demand for the 8-hour day, a demand that, although advocated by individual unions, was a demand that could only be won through political means by becoming universal.\n\nLabor Day reflected a transition phase in US labor; the 8-hour day demand was central to the formation of the American Federation of Labor, which was to rapidly outgrow the Knights of Labor as the principal organization of US workers. The Knights embraced the values of collective organization and brought together black and white, women and men, unskilled and skilled (but had one blind spot: Chinese workers were excluded), whereas the AFL was rooted in craft unionism and eventually came to stand for division embracing white not black, men not women, skilled not unskilled (sharing only the Knights' prejudice against the Chinese). But this was not inevitable: The drift toward a unionism of exclusion was contested by socialists and other labor radicals, contested by the excluded themselves.\n\nThe path not taken until the rise of industrial unionism and the birth of the CIO can be seen in some of the calls for those early Labor Day parades. In 1884, the New York Central Labor Union established the first Monday of September as the date of the parade, urging Central Labor bodies in other parts of the country to similarly act. It called the celebration \"a universal holiday for workingmen,\" in which all who toiled for a living would be welcome, stating \"No distinction of color will be made; race prejudice will be ignored, religious differences will be set aside; but all men will be on an equality provided he earns his daily bread.\" The Chicago Trades and Labor Assembly that year made it clear that women were welcome too, passing a resolution stating: \"That the first Monday in September of each year be set apart as a laborer's national holiday, and that we recommend its observance by all wage workers, irrespective of sex, calling, or nationality.\"\n\nShowing another connection lost through the years, Labor Day demands and actions in 1884 and 1885 were used to build support for the subsequent call in 1886 for May 1<sup>st</sup> as a day for strikes and marches demanding the 8-hour day. The outlook of the early craft union leaders, for the most part, reflected the radicalism of the era's labor struggles. Decentralized action by local groups seemed to them to be the basis for a more self-sustaining working-class movement – and a socialism rooted in worker's organization — than the large mixed assemblies of the Knights or the local mixed skilled and unskilled locals built by revolutionary anarchists (a strong force in Chicago and other industrial centers at the time). If we learn from a history forgotten we should remember how militancy betrayed itself when the potential for unity was not made a priority, when decentralization was set against solidarity rather than becoming its complement.\n\nThat said, those early Labor Day marches provide a legacy we should remember and uphold, for the conditions which they then fought are with us again. A statement issued by the Minneapolis Trades and Labor Assembly in 1884 shows that connection with advice still worth heeding:\n\n\"\\[We call upon workers to demonstrate\\] to capitalists, bankers and their hirelings the power you possess when thoroughly understand how to think and legislate for yourselves. While you drudge and toil away your lives for a bare existence, these idlers and non-producers live in luxury and debauchery, squandering with a lavish hand that which belongs to you – that which your labor produces. ...\n\n\"They have tried to deny us the right to organize – a right guaranteed\nby the constitution of this government. Therefore we call on you to\nshow that we defy them; that you will organize; that you have organized; that the day of deliverance is approaching. To do this we ask you to join in our ranks celebrating the day.\n\n\"The Trades and Labor Assembly proclaims to be labor's annual holiday the first Monday of September.

Sentenced to 90 days, she had just been released from prison (though now facing 5 years probation on the felony conviction) for allegedly \"assaulting\" a policeman at the six-month anniversary of Occupy Wall Street. Her arrest more than a year ago occurred in an incident that the police clearly initiated. That fact, along with the refusal of the judge to allow the jury to hear evidence vital to her defense – in particular records that the officer in question had been charged with excessive use of force in other incidents — and the insistence of the prosecutor to press harsh charges exemplify the continuing hostility of the New York establishment to the legacy of the Occupy movement.\n\nThe two speakers were LucyParks and Chris Hicks. Parks is a New York City activist and a leading member of Justice for Cecily Committee and Hicks, a national staff member of Jobs with Justice, but speaking from his experience with DC & NYC Occupy. Each emphasized McMillan's informal, but real leadership role in Occupy (significant in a movement that rejected the notion of leadership) and, especially, her emphasis on the importance of formulating demands as the basis of organizing. These were particularly important in a movement in which many questioned the validity of leadership per se, questioned the legitimacy of formulating demands.\n\nTaken together, the talks gave a sense of Occupy's development, the political debates within it, and the continuing engagement in different social justice arenas by many of those who had taken part in it. And they served as a reminder that the challenge to politics as usual, the challenge to the systemic abuse of power by those in power, was the reason the movement was suppressed.\n\nHicks focused on the context in which McMillan's arrest was made possible. He described the level of police harassment throughout the Occupation of Zuccotti Plaza and of activists thereafter. Extensive police surveillance of key activists may have led to her being a specific target. Moreover, the permitted excessive use of force against Occupy protestors created the context that gives police the \"right\" to treat dissent as criminal. Parks talked about the role of solidarity in keeping the public's eye on McMillan and thereby preventing her sentence from being longer than it likely would otherwise have been. The Justice for Cecily Committee led the effort, with[*solidarity support from DSA*](http://www.dsausa.org/justice_denied_for_cecily_mcmillan)members and many others, to keep her case in the public eye. She also spoke of Cecily's experience at the Rikers Island prison, the awful conditions many of the women prisoners with whom she served time must cope with, and of how these are an outgrowth of policing patterns that target African Americans and Latinos.\n\nThe line dividing society was evident in another aspect of the case. The charges against McMillan were brought by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. Vance is a scion of a family long a part of the dominant political circles in the US, and an ardent defender of the \"1%,\" of the Wall Street executives with whom he is personally close and politically defends. Thus his prosecutorial zeal does not extend up the ladder; Vance brought no charges against any banker for the practices that brought the country to the brink of financial ruin and led to massive loss of homes, of jobs.\n\nFollowing their presentation, local DSA member (and former Young Democratic Socialists leader) David Duhalde, who helped recruit McMillan to DSA, moderated questions and answers. The discussion, continued at a local restaurant when the meeting ended, touched on Cecily's personal situation, the nature and on-going work of Occupy Wall Street, and our broken criminal justice system.\n\nAs we go to press, the systemic injustice of our justice system, the impunity with which police forces are able to act, is on display with all its tragic consequences in Ferguson, Missouri. Giving proof to the argument developed by Michelle Alexander in her **The New Jim Crow**, we see the connection between racism, economic injustice, and the militarization of police forces with its impact on the civil liberties for us all. The suppression of civil liberties in instances of political protest and the suppression of civil liberties in communities of color are inter-related and need to be confronted as a shared injustice.\n\nThese events emphasize the relevance of the statement McMillan issued upon her release that highlighted the realities women prisoners face and the need for continued solidarity with their struggle for justice.

Millionaires and billionaires who had a vested interest in silencing a peaceful protest about the growing inequalities in America worked the justice system, manipulated the evidence presented and suddenly I became dangerous and distinguished from law-abiding citizens. On May 5th the jury delivered its verdict, the judge deemed me undesirable, and officers drove me across that bridge and barred me within. On the outside, I spent my time fighting for freedom and rights, On the inside I discovered a world where words like freedom and rights don't even exist in the first place. I walked in with one movement, and return to you a representative of another. That bridge right there, that divides the city from Rikers Island does not only divide two worlds, today I hope to bring them closer together.\n\n. . .\n\nWorking with my sisters to organize for change in the confines of jail has strengthened my belief in participatory democracy and collective action. I am inspired by the resilient community I have encountered in a system that is stacked against us. The only difference between people we call \"law-abiding\" citizens and the women I served time with is the unequal access to resources.

This bird's population numbered 3 to 5 billion individuals before European settlement of North America and was still numbering in the billions in the 1860s. Then, in less than 50 years, it was completely extinct. How is this possible?\n\nPassenger pigeons were unlike any other birds in our natural history. They may have constituted one quarter of the bird population of our country. This single species would gather in huge flocks to feed and breed. They lived off the beechnuts of our eastern forests and travelled in huge flocks that would darken the skies.\n\nThe passenger pigeon was the second most important wild food bird in North America, after the turkey – and this was true for both the Native Americans and the European settlers. They were an important source of food for poor people and slaves. Their bodies were full of fat that could be used as a form of butter. These qualities and their seemingly endless abundance would be their downfall.\n\nThe rise of commercial hunting combined with deforestation are the underlying drivers of the passenger pigeon's extinction. The railroads made it possible to kill and ship large numbers of pigeons to more distant markets. Companies formed to hire professional hunters who followed the flocks. They were easily killed in large numbers by a single shotgun blast.\n\nAll kinds of killing methods were devised. Elaborate nets were set up to trap the birds, trees were set afire, birds were immobilized with fumes of burning sulfur. The birds were pickled and salted and shipped to market in large numbers. One professional hunter is credited with killing 3 million birds in the course of his career.\n\nThe pigeons were attacked in their breeding grounds, which disrupted their breeding behavior and probably contributed to fewer births. As their numbers plummeted, it became more difficult for the remaining individuals to meet and mate. They had formerly mated in very large groups. By the mid- 1890s they had become very scarce across their range.\n\nThe last individual, a female nicknamed Martha, died in the Cincinnati Zoo on September 1, 1914. Her body was frozen and shipped to the Smithsonian where she was stuffed and mounted and is still kept. You can see a stuffed passenger pigeon, though not Martha, in the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History as a part of a display of the birds that used to inhabit the District of Columbia.\n\nWhat can be learned from the rapid extermination of this bird that might prevent a repetition of this sort of destruction? For one thing, the commercial harvest of any wildlife is difficult to sustain. As long as pigeons were hunted for subsistence by Native Americans and settlers, there was not a massive depletion of the resource. But mass consumption in the market could not be sustained.\n\nWhat killed the pigeons off was a drive to kill as many as possible to ship to distant markets for sale. The extinction cannot be separated from these factors and from the rise of railroads.\n\nParallels in today's world are sharks being killed for the shark fin soup trade and elephants for the ivory trade.\n\nGlobally, one in seven species of birds is threatened with extinction. The main threat to their existence is habitat destruction and alteration. It is predicted that unbridled climate change could raise the percentage to half of all bird species. This would [*include common species that are not currently threatened.*](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23697uptohalfofallbirdsthreatenedbyclimatechang)\n\nThe bottom line is that passenger pigeons were killed off by exactly the same forces that are emptying the oceans of fish. The profit motive comes into intense conflict with people trying to conserve a resource – especially where there is not an effective governmental body that can regulate or stop these clear depredations. Change also needs support in the community through organizing and educating.\n\n*What can you do to protect and enjoy birds in your community?*\n\n1\\.

Byerly*\n\nDonna Leon's mystery novels are an imaginative escape for Leftists who seek a little relief from day-to-day political challenges. Leon, who was born and raised in Montclair, NJ, has lived in Venice for three decades ([*http://www.donnaleon.net/*](http://www.donnaleon.net/)). She writes about the city, environs and culture she has embraced from a decidedly feminist, Leftist sensibility, infusing her police commissioner Guido Brunetti novels with the rich sensory detail of Venetian waterways, architecture, history, smells, language, and most tantalizing, mouth-watering cuisine, while also spinning great, engaging stories.\n\nIn two dozen Brunetti novels beginning with her first, *Death at La Fenice*, in 1992, Leon's murder plots are typically dramatic and ensconced in political and sexual intrigue. In *La Fenice*, a German conductor named Wellauer is found poisoned in his dressing room at the famous opera house during intermission. The suspects are many: Is it Flavia the soprano who appears to be having a relationship with a British woman? Or the baritone, the tenor, or Wellauer's young unhappy wife? And, does Wellauer's wartime Nazi past connections have anything to do with his poisoning by cyanide?\n\nIn *Dressed for Death* (1994), a man dressed as a woman is found bludgeoned to death in a field near a slaughter house where prostitutes work. But was the victim really involved in the sex trades, or was his grisly murder motivated by his work in financial matters that threatened to expose others' wrongdoing? And how is Giancarlo Santomauro, a prominent defense lawyer who happens to be in the apartment of a male prostitute Brunetti goes to interview, implicated in the crime?\n\nIn *Uniform Justice* (2003), a cadet attending one of Venice's elite military academies is found hanged in the showers. Leon's disdain for all things military is never hidden but rather shapes the tone and development of this story. In one scene, Brunetti, who investigates the crime, encounters three intoxicated cadets in uniform walking with arms linked through a narrow Venetian street. As they walk toward him with the intent to displace him, he gives a swift kick to the ankle of one cadet, sending him careening onto the pavement in agony.\n\nLeon speaks clearly through her characters, who some readers note are \"fascinating and believable.\" Her hero central figure Brunetti, the vice commissario of Venice police, is a complicated guy who has been compared to the French writer Simenon's Inspector Maigret. Like Maigret, Brunetti is \"a serious, honest anti-hero . . . sober yet deep, subtle yet elegant.\" His investigations are intelligent and plodding, never rushed, and they are replete with his internal thoughts that ponder the meanings of life, crime, and human relations . One reviewer notes that in Brunetti Leon has created \"the quintessential police detective. . . a surprisingly neat man: tie carefully knotted, hair shorter than was the fashion; even his ears lay close to his head, as if reluctant to call attention to themselves. His clothing marked him as Italian. The cadence of his speech announced that he was Venetian. His eyes were all policeman.\"\n\nAnother reviewer mentions the scenes that Leon creates between Brunetti and his \"pompous, faintly stupid boss, who doesn't even know when he's being insulted by Brunetti.\" These exchanges between the dim boss and his brighter underling pepper the novels and provide a space for both levity and challenges to upper class pretenses.\n\nLeon's novels examine gender and class relations at a number of levels, but never brashly, in fact, mostly in the context of Brunetti's home and family life. His wife Paola, daughter of an Italian count, was raised in and among the aristocracy but chose to pursue an academic life in English literature. The family – Guido, Paola and two teenagers – are supported by the modest incomes of a professor and a policeman. They live in an apartment with a terrace that looks out over the city, where many of Guido and Paola's political conversations take place. Paola cooks fabulous (elaborately described) meals served in courses. They pour wine liberally with both lunch and dinner.\n\nAfter hours, Paola and Guido talk more philosophically about his cases, her teaching and research, the affairs of their city, over a glass of grappa. This is a mature, egalitarian relationship with no taboos on subject matter or calling each other's views into question. In *Willful Behavior* (2002) Paola asks Guido why he bothers to read the *Gazzettino*, one of several newspapers he follows daily. In one of its stories, the paper had just referred to a woman who had been kidnapped some years before as \"*confessing* to having been the victim of some sort of sexual attack.\" Why would a woman *confess* to being victimized, she demanded, and addedthen, \"I don't know why you bother to read it!\"\n\nLeon never shies away from the political realities of Italian life, whether corruption in government, the peculiar power dynamics of academic departments, or a class system still based on feudal structures that include a titled aristocracy. One reviewer observed that she also is \"a great hater: hates the Mafia, the Vatican, the American military (in no particular order) – along with neo-Stalinist architecture, the kid sex trade, and a long list more.\" She also routinely belittles U.S. culture, particularly as exhibited by American tourists who throng to the city in summertime.\n\nLeon launched her Brunetti mysteries after a career as a lecturer in English literature for the University of Maryland's international programs that took her to posts in Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Iran and China, before she settled in Venice. Her novels bear the signs of her academic training in their attention to cultural and historical detail, political dynamics, and feminist and critical analyses. She is a skillful writer, and her tightly edited stories are nonetheless notable for their rich descriptions of the ambience of Venetian life and places.\n\nEuropean audiences, particularly Germany and the UKBritish, popularized Leon's work before she developed an American following. Recognition for her work novels includes the CWA Macallan Silver Dagger for Fiction for *A Sea of Troubles* and *Willful Behavior*, the first of which draws readers into the world of fishing on Pellestrina Island, just off the coast of Venice. *Sea of Troubles* stands out as one of Leon's best examinations of a marginal social class, the men and women reliant on a dwindling supply of fish and shellfish for their living and their contentious relations among themselves and with those on mainland Italy. She also subtly sets forth the limitations of rigid gender roles institutionalized by the nature of the hard physical work of men and the entrenched customs of women who them. In this rather isolated subculture, there is little way out.\n\nFiction allows writers to advance political analyses through the device of storytelling, the creation of complex characters, and dialogue that engages ideas and problems in more customary cotillion settings than non-fiction writing can accomplish. Donna Leon's mysteries open the are ways for those who want more than just an entertaining whodunit page turner. Readers will also get that, but with more to poke and arouse consciousness.\n\n[*Report on Socialist Organizing Weekend/Young Leaders Retreat*](http://dsadc.org/report-on-socialist-organizing-weekendyoung-leaders-retreat/)\n\nMonday, September 1st, 2014\n\n***The Washington Socialist*** &lt;&gt; **Labor Day 2014**\n\n*****By Jose Gutierrez *\n\nSeveral under-40 year-old Metro DSA members participated in a national retreat located in Bolivar, Pa. The event served as both the Young Democratic Socialists' (DSA's youth section) summer conference and activist training for DSA members under 40. One of the event's main purposes was for YDS and younger DSA members to interact and learn from each other. Our contingent was composed of seasoned DSA & YDS conference attendees as well as those who had never registered for a national gathering.\n\nDSA chapters represented included members from Atlanta, Detroit, DC, New York City, Philly, Providence, Sacramento, and Utah. YDS chapters included New York, Ohio, Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and California. Attendance seemed equally split between YDS campus activists and DSA local members.\n\nMany of us arrived Thursday night. We took part in several workshops and sessions Friday thru Sunday. We shared information about the state of our chapters and the situation that we faced in our corner of the country.\n\nCaucuses met during lunch and included: writers, LGBTQ, women, people of color, ableism/disability, and education. The identity based caucuses want to develop members in their identity areas because they want YDS and DSA to have a more diverse membership and leadership.\n\nThe weekend was also the YDS annual internal, and the primarily campus organization voted on two key agenda items: to shrink the coordinating committee (their volunteer leadership body) and their Activist Agenda (the national priorities). Members decided to shrink the coordinating committee from twelve to six seats, with 50% quotas from women and people of color. The student activists also voted to maintain work fighting student debt as their main focus in the coming year.\n\nI was impressed by the diversity of the participants that took part: ethnic, class, gender, and sexual orientation. This diversity was better than previous DSA conferences that I've attended. Also learning from comrades on what has worked for them and what does not was very useful. I hope that all of the participants will be able to continue the conversation that we started in Bolivar, Pa. and I look forward to the next time we get together.","order":8},{"title":"Review: Creative Path to a Future of Work","date":"2014-09-01","issue":"September 2014","author":"Daniel Adkins","body":"*&gt;&gt;Creativity Inc.*, by Ed Catmull (Random House, $28)\n\nThe new book, *Creativity, Inc*., suggests an increasingly dynamic culture in the more creative sectors of U.S. industry. The guidelines for the \"creative industry\" are in sharp contrast to how most U.S. industry and government currently work. Yet the future holds broad competition with a mercantile China and others, when all our work will require creativity and sustainability. How we treat each other and work will be changing to meet future needs. Whether we meet the challenge by a part of the U.S., or by all of us will be important.\n\nAn old work model from 1900s is called \"Taylorism\" or scientific management (sic) which is still alive in Amazon. This theory aimed at controlling the physical work of labor by using time and motion studies to script the flow of work. Combined with the assembly line, it influenced work for much of the last century. Taylorist theory moved the mental aspects of physical labor to be decided by industrial engineers and management. Some of its excesses were mitigated by labor unionization. Today Amazon uses Taylorism and computers to drive some employees so severely in un-air-conditioned warehouses that ambulances are needed to preserve the un-unionized worker's lives. It seems Jeff Bezos' libertarian individualism works for CEO's wealth but not so much for workers survivability.\n\nIn the 1950s another movement was increasingly apparent and sometimes it was called the quality movement or the Deming System of Profound Knowledge. This system was the development of W. Edwards Deming's life's work and was an effort to systematize the mental labor of work and management. Instead of programming labor like a computer, Deming wanted to enroll labor's mental capacities by giving them skills to evaluate the work process and provide aid. Management was also engaged to think in terms of systems of work and design as well of the psychology of workers and management. Deming's teaching in Japan resulted Japan's leapfrogging the quality of American cars and other products.\n\nThe Deming principles go far beyond the focus on short-term profits and managers' belief that they have sole responsibility to control an organization. Deming's System of Profound Knowledge includes an appreciation of the system of production and market, a knowledge of variation of quality including statistical sampling, a theory of knowledge including its limits, and a knowledge of psychology and human nature. This focus presupposes an organizations learning to cooperate within and between themselves, driving out fear to enable honest communication, allowing pride of workmanship, instituting education and self-improvement, and believing that organizational transformation is everybody's job. He also championed the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle. Deming demanded a profoundly cooperative, educational, and motivated system with a long-term view in order to create a highly competitive organization.\n\nBelow are some of Deming's principles:\n\n1.  Create a constant purpose toward improvement.\n\n2.  Continuously improve your systems and processes.\n\n3.  Use training on the job.\n\n4.  Implement leadership (Be a coach instead of a policeman).\n\n5.  Eliminate fear.\n\n6.  Break down barriers between departments.\n\n7.  Remove barriers to pride of workmanship.\n\n8.  Implement education and self-improvement.\n\n9.  Make \"transformation\" everyone's job.\n\n*Creativity, Inc.* is the history of the growth of computer graphics and Pixar, which is one of the U.S. entertainment industry's crown jewels. Pixar is the culmination of over 40 years of computer animation development mixed with world-class storytelling. The author, Ed E. Catmull, helped lead the computer graphic revolution that allowed Pixar to excel. The author expanded his technical skills into the management of creative people including artists of stories and animation. The story of Pixar is the story of inventing the enabling hardware, software, culture, processes, and story lines.\n\nSome of Pixar's principles are listed below and the reader will see that they parallel Deming's theories. These are the most relevant to development and creative tasks but can enable excellence in much work.\n\n-   When hiring people, give more weight to their growth potential then their current skill level.\n\n-   If there are people in your organization not free to suggest ideas, you lose.\n\n-   \"Engaging the collective brainpower of the people you work with is an active, ongoing process. As a manager, you must coax ideas out of your staff and constantly push them to contribute.\"\n\n-   \"If there is fear in an organization, there is a reason for it – our job is to find what's causing it, understand it, and try to root it out.\"\n\n-   \"If there is more truth in the hallways than at meeting, you have a problem.\"\n\n-   \"Sharing problems is an act of inclusion that makes employees feel invested in the enterprise.\"\n\n-   \"Many managers feel that if they are not notified about problems before others . . then that is a sign of disrespect. Get over it.\" \\[This can happen when managers are more focused on competing with each other, than solving agency problems.\\]\n\n-   \"Change and uncertainty are part of life. Our job is not to resist them but to build the capacity to recover when the unexpected events occur.\"\n\n-   \"Failure isn't a necessary evil. . . It is a necessary consequence of doing something new.\"\n\n-   \"The people ultimately responsible for implementing a plan must be empowered to make decisions when things go wrong, even before getting approval.\"\n\n-   \"Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.\" \\[management competition and pride can block this\\]\n\n-   \"An organization, as a whole, is more conservative and resistant to change than the individuals who comprise it. . . . it takes substantial energy to move a group, even when all are on board.\"\n\nThe trick of these statements is to think of them as a prompt toward deeper inquiry.\n\nWorking in the federal government gave me a view to the limits of bureaucratic work. When staff and managers compete with each other, often knowledge of the work process, potential options, creativity, and efficiency are lost.\n\nThe question of work styles or cultures may become more intense in coming years when China becomes a more developed country. China is a mercantilist country lead by an elite that is focused on maximizing the country's economic wealth and dominance. The U.S. is different in that it tries to maximize its elites' wealth, but not the country's wealth (i.e. its people's potential). A mercantilist country is more focused on maximizing its national abilities and potential, and should outperform leadership like the U. S. elites that are more focused on extracting wealth from its people than on developing them. This contradiction will make for increasing political fractures in the U. S. A support for U. S. competiveness is an effective government that supports all our pursuit of happiness, growth, and development. Social democratic programs that support free education and health care, sustainable growth, and worker involvement in design and leadership will more completely grow and use all of our mental and physical powers. This is the promise of a Star Trek society that will work together for our and all the world's growth and development.","order":9},{"title":"Solidarity for Peace or War: A perspective on Ukraine, Russia and the New Cold War","date":"2014-09-01","issue":"September 2014","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"**Introduction**\n\nThe article below was written in early July; unfortunately it is just as relevant now at the end of August. And the analysis below is relevant to the unconditional support the US is giving Israel during the on-going fighting in Gaza. Political conflicts require political solutions; the attempt to impose military solutions inevitable fails (as is evident once again in the current crisis in Iraq). The police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri provides an example of a domestic equivalent, as does the response to the subsequent protests. Militarization – whether of our own police forces or our foreign policy – only serves to strengthen social injustice, only serves to strengthen reaction.\n\n**Choices and Alternatives**\n\nDenounced and threatened for the on-going crisis in Ukraine, Russia is routinely held as responsible for the violence and turmoil in the area by the White House, State Department, leading members of Congress and virtually the entire mainstream media. By contrast, the US, the European Union, and NATO are all presented as disinterested parties motivated primarily by humanitarian concerns, responding to a situation rather than being active forces in creating the problems now to be addressed. Debates within government and press are limited to the ways and means of intervening. The underlying assessment of events and of our government's moral superiority, our right to intervene if we so choose, are unquestioned.\n\nBehind that pose lies an imperial arrogance in which no legitimate interests are acknowledged other than those of the dominant powers – therefore Ukrainians on all sides of the political spectrum and from the various communities that comprise the country are denied agency as though puppets without opinions of their own. Goals sought by people on either side of conflict are ignored except as soundbites and photo-ops depicting supposed virtuous democrats who just want to \"join the West\" and share in the good life we allegedly all enjoy.\n\nSome, no doubt, may even believe that; nonetheless the political range of Ukrainians is far wider and more complex – as are the goals driving US policy. Diversity of opinion and underlying analysis, however, are absent from coverage of the crisis – and absent from our political discourse. Stephen Cohen notes in *The Nation:*\n\nAs atrocities and humanitarian disaster grow in Ukraine, both Obama and Kerry have all but vanished as statesmen. Except for periodic banalities asserting the virtuous intentions of Washington and Kiev and alleging Putin's responsibility for the violence, they have left specific responses to lesser US officials. Not surprisingly, all have told the same Manichean story, from the White House to Foggy Bottom. ... Still more shameful, no American official at any level appears to have issued a meaningful statement of sympathy for civilian victims of the Kiev government, not even those in Odessa. Instead, the administration has been unswervingly indifferent. When asked if her superiors had \"any concerns\" about the casualties of Kiev's military campaign, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki has repeatedly answered \"no.\" Indeed, at the UN Security Council on May 2, US Ambassador Samantha Power, referring explicitly to the \"counterterrorism initiative\" and suspending her revered \"Responsibility to Protect\" doctrine, gave Kiev's leaders a US license to kill. ... (Since then, the administration has blocked Moscow's appeal for a UN humanitarian corridor between southeastern Ukraine and Russia).\n\nEchoed by the press and television, this outlook bespeaks a double standard that allows the current wave of violence directed at ethnic Russians and Russian-language speakers in Ukraine to be ignored; one can only imagine the headlines were the equivalent violence launched by forces our foreign policy apparatus deemed unfriendly. It is a uniformity of opinion that replaces historical understanding with self-serving anecdotes rooted in \"good guy\" \"bad guy\" story-telling. The construction of an \"evil\" opponent, of an \"other\" to be feared — in this instance, Russian President Putin — functions to depoliticize discussion, and inhibit debate. Consequently, the ability of the broader society to intervene in foreign policy debate and to construct a alternative perspective is contained, all such questions handled by self-serving \"experts.\" This serves, too, to sever foreign policy from domestic policy, a particularly false divide in this era of globalization.\n\nBy contrast, what is needed is an alternative approach that connects humanitarian concerns to a challenge unequal to the injustices rooted in corporate/military power — as suggested in a resolution adopted by the European Left Party (ELP) entitled \"No More War, No More Fascism:\"\n\nWe call on all parties to the conflict to stop armed operations and to avoid further escalation of the situation. We are against repression by the military forces and armed militias. The conflict has to be solved by negotiations and political democratic means, as e.g. referenda.\n\nWe consider as the main factors in the Ukraine crisis the imperial attitude towards the country, as shown by all major powers involved: the deliberately provocative and bellicose moves by USA, NATO and EU as well as the aggressive steps taken by Russia. This leads to a dangerous situation at our doorsteps, with reminiscence to the Cold War and even to the WWI outbreak in 1914.\n\nWe are against undemocratic repression of communist party, left wing, and other democratic political forces. We demand the release of all political prisoners and people taken hostage.\n\nWe demand an impartial international investigation of the Maidan shooting \\[hundreds were killed in government/protestor violence when street demonstrations turned into a coup\\], Odessa massacre \\[explained below\\], and of all other war crimes committed during the conflict. We condemn the presence of fascist forces like Svoboda and Pravi Sektor in the government and state apparatus, and the presence of far-right forces in the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lugansk.\n\nWe are strongly against the austerity measures imposed on Ukraine by the EU \\[European Union\\] and IMF \\[International Monetary Fund\\], and we support the right of Ukrainian people to control the resources of their own country and their rights for social protection. We are against the presence of any foreign forces on the soil of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n**Looking Within**\n\nThe last paragraph is key, for igniting the conflict last year was the then Ukrainian government's rejection of the austerity program that would have followed incorporation into the European Union (as working people in southern and eastern Europe have already discovered) – an austerity program that labor and the left in the US oppose domestically and should also oppose abroad. For the \"liberal\" human rights the US is promoting in Ukraine are for the rights of banks and corporations to stand over and above the rights of working people. The logic of Citizens United, turning corporations into people and endowing them with greater rights than living, breathing beings, does not stop at our border. Bill Blum noted the extent to which the US had been working on behalf of those political/economic goals long before the Ukrainian crisis broke out in violence.\n\nThe National Endowment for Democracy, an agency created by the Reagan administration in 1983 to promote political action and psychological warfare against states not in love with US foreign policy, is Washington's foremost non-military tool for effecting regime change. The NED website lists 65 projects that it has supported financially in recent years in Ukraine. The descriptions NED gives to the projects don't reveal the fact that generally their programs impart the basic philosophy that working people and other citizens are best served under a system of free enterprise, class cooperation, collective bargaining, minimal government intervention in the economy, and opposition to socialism in any shape or form. A free-market economy is equated with democracy, reform, and growth; and the merits of foreign investment in their economy are emphasized.\n\nDeveloping a critical perspective on US policy toward the Ukraine and Russia is part and parcel of challenging the assumption that our society, our political and economic system, our government's foreign policy, is in essence a positive good relative to the rest of the world (an assumption maintained even by many who critique aspects of the system). The justifications used to support our aggressive, interventionist overseas actions – especially when pictured as actions conducted for \"humanitarian\" reasons – reinforce a narrow nationalism which limits questioning of the fundamental nature of our system. And, by identifying the \"free market,\" the capitalist system, as an objective good, it reinforces the logic that socialism is illegitimate (and, far short of that, that social programs – such as health care – are somehow limitations on freedom). The needed criticism of authoritarian and unjust actions by the Russian government loses its force when our system is used as a yardstick against which others are measured.\n\nAfter all, the US \"right\" to act as the world's policeman and to intervene directly or indirectly in other nation's affairs loses much of its force if we are guilty of the same (or worse) transactions. No overseas action of Russia (or China, or any of our putative opponents abroad) is comparable to the deaths and destruction the US has directly inflicted on countries far from our border – be it Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq or numerous \"lesser\" engagements. And criticism of political repression in Russia or by the previous government of the Ukraine is hypocritical so long as we allow the kind of domestic repression that denied \"freedom of assembly\" to Occupy Wall Street encampments. Solidarity with embattled trade unionists in countries our foreign policy targets has little meaning if not connected to the substantive, defacto limitation on US unions' rights to strike, organize, bargain, engage in political action. So too the denunciation of Russian \"oligarchs\" (and of those Ukrainian \"oligarchs\" we opposed and helped depose) is used to conjure up an image of evil that avoids acknowledging that our own 1% is richer and politically more powerful. That poverty, inequality and injustice so easily condemned abroad exists in our own country – though too often ignored by those for who from their seats of power sit in judgment over others.\n\n**Looking Abroad **\n\nThis is the framework in which to try and understand developments in Ukraine. It is too easy to engage in competing horror stories in countries far away in which most who are taking sides one way or the other know little of the history and culture of those of whom they speak, who fail to know the literature or language of people readily cast into pre-determined images. While an \"us against them\" viewpoint is easy to state, it inevitably fails to explain anything at all. Certainly, on both sides of the conflict in the Ukraine there are activists and groups involved who see themselves as promoting democracy, see themselves as victims of repression. And certainly on all sides of the conflict in the Ukraine, foreign governments are working to advance their own national interests.\n\nBut the forces backed by the US and EU are those committed to that neo-liberal agenda also embodied in attempts to expand free trade pacts and weaken social safety nets. It is the austerity agenda the European Left scored, that also finds the US aligned with ultra-nationalists looking for an ethnically pure state, finds us aligned with fascist organizations (just as in some parts of the world it has us aligned with militant Islamists we oppose in other places). For those right-wing forces support a new model of social integration to accompany giving a free hand to the blind market – a model of exclusion enforced by violence.\n\nThe attempt to solve Ukraine's economic and social challenges via integration into western capitalism creates social dislocation – a dislocation which some see as only resolvable by a policy of exclusion. This has been the path of Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Spain, and other countries and has led to attacks on Roma, immigrants from central Africa or from the Arab world, even to a revival of anti-Semitism. And the search by western eyes for that \"other\" to be condemned has turned toward Russian-language speakers in the Ukraine, to Russia itself. The fact that structural adjustment policies promote globalization and cultural freedom while making societies more unequal and less democratic opens up political space to right-wingers who use the language of freedom to suppress any sign of equality – a process analogous in some ways to the Tea Party, anti-immigrant supporters and others of similar views here at home.\n\nIn Ukraine, however, this has resulted in horrific violence, and has been utilized by actual fascists who, though relatively small in number, are disproportionately influential. Along with the racist attacks designed to divide Ukraine, undermining its character and further narrowing its politics have come attacks on Ukraine's unions, and on the left (including, but not limited to the Communist Party). All this is acceptable to our media and politicians as is the repression imposed by the Saudi kingdom over its people and neighbors – because it reinforces that free-market capitalist order that is considered the only acceptable form of society. The depths of that acceptance allows the unquestioned moral relativism within the US (aided and abetted by McCarthyism's legacy) that does not condemn as \"undemocratic\" the destruction of Ukraine's Communist Party offices, assaults on its members, bans on its public activities.\n\nBut that does not mean that authoritarian groups cannot be found on either side of the divide, that on both sides are groups seeking an expansive democracy. What it does underscore is that reaction moves in when demands for freedom and social rights, for a more liberal society are divorced from demands for social justice, equality and peace. In practical terms it reinforces the need to support calls for negotiations rather than further militarization of the conflict, for only through a political process can a just solution be found.\n\n**A Bit of History**\n\nWe are too quick to forget the past, exemplified by the ease with which arguments used to justify war in Iraq or Vietnam are recycled today. Yet there is a direct connection between the growth of US global domination and the diminution of the rights of working people. The United Electrical Workers (UE) issued a statement to combat that forgetfulness by placing the Ukrainian conflict in the context of our past. The union begins with a review of developments since early this year:\n\nOn February 22, the elected president of Ukraine was overthrown in a coup which was supported by the Obama administration. Since then, the country has been torn apart and violence has escalated. On May 2 in the southern city of Odessa, supporters of the new unelected Kiev government, including members of the violent extremist Right Sector party, surrounded peaceful, unarmed anti-government protestors who had taken refuge in the city's main union hall. The right-wing crowd then set the union hall on fire, and 46 people died by being burned alive or jumping to their deaths trying to escape.\n\nWe are troubled by this horrific atrocity, and by the fact that mass murder was committed by burning a union hall. We are concerned about the conflict in Ukraine, by the massing of Russian troops near Ukraine's eastern border and U.S. and NATO troops and planes in neighboring Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which signal the return of the Cold War and the threat of a much hotter war.\n\nThe statement then goes on to explain the reasons why UE's particular past has made it aware as a union of the importance of opposing this drift as a labor issue relevant to all working people:\n\nA defining period in the history of UE was our union's courageous opposition to the Cold War. At the end of World War II there was great hope among union members and other Americans for a continuation of FDR's New Deal, with progressive social and economic policies including national healthcare, expanded Social Security, and progress against racial discrimination in employment. What we got instead was the anti-union Taft-Hartley Act and the Cold War. Military spending, including the nuclear arms race, continued to trump all other priorities. Local conflicts all over the world were treated as global showdowns between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. In the name of \"fighting communism,\" the U.S. sided with the French and British colonial empires against independence movements, and backed many brutal dictators against their own people. The 40-year-long Cold War included some very hot wars – notably Korea and Vietnam. The CIA organized coups that overthrew democratic governments that dared to disagree with the U.S. government or corporations. On the domestic front, the Cold War was a massive attack on civil liberties and an effort to wipe out organizations, including UE, that refused to enlist in the Cold War.\n\n**** Cold War arguments and ideology are resurfacing in one account after the other of the Ukraine and Russia, despite the Cold War having long been over. But the US tendency to global expansion and the deleterious effect of that expansion remains as it was. And the connection between that past and the present weakness of US labor and the slow erosion of democratic rights here at home should give pause to those who so uncritically want to jump on the band-wagon of calls for sanctions, for any action that further inflames conflict.\n\n**Action**\n\nWorking for peace is active, not passive; it is a form of engagement, not a withdrawal from conflicts around the world. Opposing US foreign policy means acting in solidarity with all working people, with all who suffer from repression and oppression, irrespective of which side they are on. Only via advocacy for an engaged alternative overseas policy will it be possible to challenge both the domestic and overseas corporate/militarist agenda, to build support for an alternative domestic and foreign policy.\n\nThe perspective offered by the European Left Party noted above provides one framework in which to conceive this. UE concludes its statement with a similar call:\n\nWe reaffirm UE's historic position. We favor peace and friendly, equitable economic relations between nations. We favor negotiations rather than military confrontation to resolve disputes, including this one. We believe the countries that defeated Nazism in World War II, including the U.S. and Russia, should work together against any resurgence of racism, anti-Semitism and fascism in Europe.\n\nIn this, we can build on the recent experience of war in Iraq, which was justified by horror stories about Saddam Hussein – and which broad sections, one can say the majority, of US society came to oppose not because of sympathy for Hussein, not out of a misguided belief that he represented a positive social model, but because change cannot be imposed from without, because the purpose of the war was rooted in a corporate imperative toward expansion unrelated to the degree of human rights permitted or repressed in the government being targeted. US Labor Against War was the key organization which successfully mobilized union opposition to the invasion. Its statement on Ukraine reflects a similar perspective:\n\nThere is plenty of blame to go around and all parties share some responsibility for the crisis. It defies simple solutions. We here in the U.S. may not have any opportunity to influence other parties to the conflict, but we do have both the opportunity and responsibility to influence our own government.\n\nU.S. Labor Against the War opposes any and all resort to military force or the threat of military force by the U.S. or any other party in response to developments in Ukraine. USLAW calls on the U.S. government to abide by the U.N. charter that bans war and the use of force, and to rely on diplomatic processes in dealing with all affected parties to resolve differences peacefully.\n\nUSLAW opposes expressions of or appeals to racism, anti-Semitism, jingoism or xenophobia and acts of violence motivated by them, whether committed in the U.S. or by Russians, Crimeans, Ukrainians, or any others.\n\nThe U.S. must not contribute to the crisis by introducing more arms or escalating hostile rhetoric. Most certainly launching war games and expanding the \"missile defense\" program represent a dangerous escalation, and lend themselves to potentially tragic miscalculation.\n\nUSLAW encourages our affiliates and all union members to better understand the situation in Ukraine, and events leading up to the current crisis. We caution against relying on the corporate media for an accurate and unbiased perspective.\n\nIt remains important to understand and debate the nature of events, even where sources of information are limited. Debate that is not about picking sides, but rather is rooted in trying to gain a deeper understanding of the reasons social conflict turns violent, of the challenges others face in navigating challenges of race and nationality, of cultural freedom and democratic rights, of sexual equality and an end to violence in everyday life within the framework of the need to ensure social justice and universal social standards that enable all who live within given borders to enjoy a secure life.\n\nBut such debate and discussion ought not to lose sight that, however the conflict in Ukraine (or the next such situation) is understood, the primary goal of those seeking justice here in the US is to work to influence working people, the political climate and government action in the direction of support for peace and negotiations. Together with that we should strive to build a diverse set of links abroad to develop an ever-more informed global solidarity, seeing within that the basis for strengthening an agenda here and abroad that promotes labor and human rights, that builds support for a socialist alternative to capitalist politics of war and oppression anywhere.\n\n\n\nQuotes:\n\nELP Statement on Ukraine Conflict: \"No More War, No More Fascism!\" July 2, 2014 ([*http://www.european-left.org/positions/ukraine-no-more-war-no-more-fascism*](http://www.european-left.org/positions/ukraine-no-more-war-no-more-fascism)).\n\nThe Silence of American Hawks About Kiev's Atrocities by Stephen F.

Adkins","body":"Many progressives are faced with solar- averse utilities like Dominion Virginia Power that limit our ability to move to a sustainable future. When we try to regulate some utilities on the state or national level we are met with the utility buying state and national representatives. Direct appeals at the utility level may fail because we often find that utility leadership is in sync with short–term business interests and groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). ALEC supplies prototype bills benefiting the fossil fuel industry's short-term interests. In some areas it may take a long time to get moving on sustainability on the state and national levels.\n\nOther paths to a sustainable future are available to us. Besides outfitting our own homes, we must consider actions on the community level where we may have more influence. Cities and suburbs in the mid-Atlantic states are generally more Democratic and more amenable to the needs of sustainability.\n\nAn example of community action is the award given by the Urban Libraries Council to Arlington County Library (Va.) for encouraging clean transportation, clean energy buildings, and community gardens. Another possibility might be to mobilize to outfit our local governments with renewable systems like photovoltaic panels. This action could expand the community's knowledge of solar technologies, and inspire and educate our younger citizens. Solar technologies are competitive or near competitive to fossil fuel technology. They aid important community values of public health, energy self-reliance in emergencies, and sustainability. In many states these arguments are better understood in urban and suburban areas even though they are just important in rural areas. It is just that the Tea Party members' opposition to all government blinds them to market limits (near-term bias) and community cooperation.\n\nOnce we have a nucleus of solar momentum and knowledge it may be possible to spread solar technology throughout the school system and municipal buildings and create a broader coalition to confront large utilities. Cities or coalitions of cities may be better able to negotiate better deals with a state utility. Over a decade or so it might be possible for those championing community renewables to challenge an intransigent utility with a city-based utility. In the longer term we might envision an Appalachian Power Administration District with renewable jobs replacing coal jobs for those in Appalachia and energy for all.\n\nSustainability in one city is no more a solution than sustainability in one state or country, but it is a start. For sustainability to succeed our focus must eventually find solutions for the whole world. However unless we get cooperation from political parties and business, the self-interest of the few will jeopardize the sustainability and survival of us all. The short-term focus of some business interests will have to mature into a longer-term vision tempered with the cooperation of all of us.","order":11},{"title":"Transportation for People, Not for Profit","date":"2014-09-01","issue":"September 2014","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Politicians often speak of transportation as one of the rare policy fields that lie above partisanship. \"There are no Democratic roads; there are no Republican roads\" has worked its way into the speeches of several recent secretaries of transportation in administrations of both parties. One might suppose that transportation, unlike such ideology-laden fields as health care or immigration, involves issues most people can agree upon.\n\nWe all want safe cars and planes, pothole-free streets, and bridges that lead somewhere and don't fall down. Yet the notion that transportation is nonpartisan, that solutions are the province of technology or engineering rather than policy or ideology, has been propagated largely by special interests who don't want the public asking too many questions. Corporate interests, in particular, have driven transportation policy for the past century or more, with an eye more to their own profit than to whether these policies help move people and goods.\n\nCongress and the Obama administration are currently weighing an overhaul of federal surface transportation (highway and transit) programs, an exercise that takes place every few years. In February, the Obama administration proposed a $302 billion, four-year transportation bill. However, members of Congress have their own ideas about transportation, and the debate over a multi-year authorization will continue into next year, and possibly beyond, while Congress enacts short-term authorizations to keep the concrete flowing.\n\nWhile these periodic reauthorization debates often degenerate into political posturing, they can result in policy changes that determine whether federal transportation programs can serve communities, commuters and travelers better, or whether they will become vehicles, so to speak, for helping the rich become richer while sacrificing genuine mobility, the environment and energy conservation. Therefore, it behooves socialists and other progressives to become engaged in the emerging debate over transportation policy.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nPublic transit in the form of trolleys emerged in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century – first horse-drawn and then electric – helping city-dwellers cope with the urban expansion of that period. This continued to be the predominant mode of public transportation until after the First World War, when the car came roaring into the picture.\n\nEven after Model T Fords became a common sight on US streets, trolleys still were an efficient and popular way for people to move around cities. But for a growing corporate sector invested in selling more cars – composed of automakers, oil and rubber companies and the like – trolleys were the enemy. During the 1930s, General Motors, Firestone Tires, Standard Oil and Mack Trucks formed a holding company which bought, and then dismantled, trolley systems around the country. By 1955 nearly 90 percent of the pre-war trolley systems were no more.\n\nEven in the face of the disappearing trolley, public transportation – in the form of newly minted buses (whose sales benefited GM and its fellow anti-trolley conspirators) remained popular in urban areas during the 1930s and after, especially given that fewer people could afford cars during the Great Depression.\n\nHowever, in 1956 everything began to change when Congress enacted legislation launching the construction of the Interstate and Defense Highway System. The Interstates were sold to Congress and the public first as bulwarks of national defense, and secondarily as a means for people to quickly move from city to city and around the country. But as they grew, they also altered the face of the city itself and the way people moved around metropolitan areas.\n\nThe extension of the Interstates into exurban land made it feasible for more people to live outside the city limits even if they worked in the city. Trolleys and commuter trains already had created \"streetcar suburbs\" – in the Washington area, these included the close-in neighborhoods of Mount Pleasant and Brookland as well as farther-out Anacostia and Chevy Chase – but the Interstates made possible an exponential increase in suburban living. However, it took more than the building of highways to make that happen.\n\nDevelopers, seeing profit to be made in the newly accessible suburbs, quickly began gobbling up farm and forest to be converted into tract-house communities. Their ally was the Federal Housing Administration, which provided federally subsidized mortgages for suburban homeowners but seldom to urban dwellers. This contributed to \"white flight,\" robbing cities of a large portion of their tax base and making it more difficult for them to fund schools, socials services and, of course, transportation.\n\nBusiness interests successfully lobbied for the expansion of the highway system in order to open new land for commercial exploitation. Developers have been at the forefront of the pro-highway lobby, buying exurban land and campaigning for highways to run through their property, increasing its value and making development there more profitable. Publicly, corporate interests argue for new highways as a means to relieve congestion and shorten commuting times. However, while the new highways were very effective at generating profits for developers, homebuilders, retails chains and other corporate interests, they frequently failed to reduce congestion, and often increased it.\n\nThe development of highways in the DC region provides a case study in this developer-driven highway development. The Capital Beltway, completed in 1964, was sold to the public as a way for through traffic on the East Coast to avoid having to pick its way through downtown Washington. Once the highway was completed, however, it became the Washington area's \"main street,\" with housing developments, shopping centers and office developments clustering around its 44 interchanges. Before the coming of the Beltway, Tysons Corner was a sleepy crossroads; today it is a major \"edge city;\" [*with 46 million square feet of retail and office space*](http://www.wtop.com/139/1484972/Tysons-plan-looks-at-success-pitfalls-of-Rossyln-Ballston). The Beltway not only attracted development but congestion and delay as well, with a recent study finding it to be [*third-most congested freeway in the United States.*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/20/AR2010012001265.html)\n\nDeveloper John \"Til\" Hazel, the creator of Tysons Corner and driver of much of Northern Virginia's sprawl, is a prime exemplar of profit-driven highway construction. Hazel's business plan involves buying up cheap suburban land, lobbying for roads to be built through the land, purportedly for the purpose of reducing congestion. Once the roads arrive, the value of his land multiplies, and he pockets big bucks by building housing, malls and offices along the new highway – which are accessible only by cars, leading to more congestion.\n\nLikewise, the new National Harbor complex in Prince George's County, at the Maryland end of the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge, would have been unthinkable without the favor of government-funded transportation infrastructure. For years, local business interests led efforts to replace the deteriorating, early 1960s–era bridge. They argued that a new, larger bridge would relieve a bottleneck in the Interstate system, improve the flow of traffic around the Washington region and enhance safety. Once the new bridge was completed in 2009, making it easier to cross the river, the new edge city rose quickly, [*with 300 acres of shops, condo, offices and a gargantuan Gaylord's Hotel*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Harbor,_Maryland) — and a casino on the way.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nThe result of this developer-driven transportation has been metropolitan sprawl radiating in all directions from central cities, convenient to highways but usually with limited access, if any, to transit. True mobility has been sacrificed to corporate profit, with most growth taking place in car-dependent outer suburbs at the expense of the denser, transit-accessible central cities and closer-in suburbs.\n\nHighways also cut into and across cities to provide suburbanites quick access to urban employment centers, with little thought given to the city residents whose homes lay in the way or to once-vital neighborhoods torn apart when bisected by highways – \"white men's highways through black men's bedrooms\" was the bitter but apt description. A classic example is New York's Cross-Bronx Expressway that drove once-thriving working-class Bronx neighborhoods into decline and blight*.* During the 1960s, Washington-area activists succeeded in blocking plans for highways that would have done the same to DC neighborhoods.\n\nDevelopers pitched the new suburban communities to urban dwellers as a way to escape from the crowded city and its problems to greener pastures, and millions responded. Yet postwar suburbanization brought with it a host of problems:\n\n-   The growth of suburbs drained the cities of their middle classes and their tax dollars, leaving behind an urban population that was increasingly poor and minority. Detroit's recent bankruptcy is a legacy of this trend, but nearly all large cities experienced some measure of abandonment and decline during this period.\n\n-   Residents of the low-density suburbs were almost entirely dependent on cars for mobility, leading to explosions in car ownership and miles driven. This in turn drove up the consumption of oil, seemingly limitless in supply until the energy crisis of the 1970s brought home the reality that petroleum is a finite resource. The continuing appetite for oil and insecurity about its supply led directly to such environmental disasters as the 1991 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska and 2010 Gulf of Mexico BP spill, as well as both recent US wars in the Middle East.\n\n-   Cars are one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide, the principal contributor to climate change, and other toxic pollutants. Runoff from roads, bridges and parking lots pollute drinking water. And uncontrolled, sprawling development leads to the destruction of green space [*– more than 6,000 acres per day, according to the U.S. Forest Service*](http://www.fs.fed.us/openspace/loss_space.html), equivalent to paving over an area equivalent to DC every week – which not only prevents the land from being used for recreation or wildlife habitat, but also contributes to climate change.\n\nFor at least three decades now, it has been clear that a transportation system based on motor vehicles is environmentally unsustainable and not necessarily the best way to move people and goods. And there has been change, however halting or gradual. More cities have increased the reach of their public transportation systems – as have suburbs, despite their residents often being harder to reach. The idea of \"smart growth\" – designing our communities to be walkable and convenient to transit, with shopping, services and jobs close to housing rather that segregated in malls and office parks – has gained adherents and, occasionally, has been put into practice (with jurisdictions such as Portland, Ore., and the state of Maryland adopting the principle as policy). Til Hazel's own Tysons Corner, the archetype of an auto-dependent suburban edge city, is undergoing what local officials hope will be its conversion to a walkable, transit-friendly (with three newly opened Metrorail stations), more \"urban\" suburb.\n\nThe 1991 federal surface transportation authorization – the Intermodal Transportation Surface Transportation Equity Act (ISTEA) – represented a departure from previous legislation that emphasized building more highways. [*ISTEA gave metropolitan areas unprecedented flexibility to decide whether highways or mass transit best met their transportation needs*](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/public_involvement/archive/legislation/istea.cfm). Unfortunately, subsequent authorizations have failed to build on ISTEA's model. [*The $286.4 billion, four-year transportation bill passed by Congress in 2005 degenerated into a contest to see which members could grab the most pork for their states and districts – Alaska's infamous \"Bridge to Nowhere\" was tucked into the massive bill (and, fortunately, later killed).*](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-02-pork-voters_x.htm) The most recent bill, the two-year, [*$105 billion measure passed in 2012*](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/map21/summaryinfo.cfm), curbed some of the pork but continued to favor highways at the expense of transit, bicycling and pedestrians.\n\nFederal officials have recognized that the Highway Trust Fund, derived from gas taxes and used to provide federal funding for highway and transit projects, is running out of cash. President Obama proposes to fill this gap through \"pro-growth business tax reform\" that would provide an additional $150 for transportation projects, while Congress recently injected enough cash into the fund to keep it running until May.\n\nYet a more fundamental question would be: Are we spending transportation money on the right projects? The very reason the trust fund is running dry is that, for the first time since the auto age began, Americans are beginning to drive less –[ *vehicle miles traveled in the United States are down 2 percent from 2007*](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/travel_monitoring/tvt.cfm), according to the Federal Highway Administration– partly because of the higher cost of gasoline, and partly because many people, tired of charmless suburbs and lengthy commutes by car, have moved to central cities or close-in suburbs where transit, walking and bicycling provide alternatives to driving. However, [*highways still receive four times as much federal support as transit*](http://www.dot.gov/budget/dot-budget-highlights-fiscal-year-2014). At a time when the Interstate Highway System has been deemed to be \"complete,\" and when the need to address environmental degradation has become critical, we need to question the continued push for highway-building – a practice that is more about profit than mobility.\n\nSo change will come. Will it be the change we want? Here are some elements of reform that would make serving the public and minimizing environmental impact – *not* corporate profit — the highest priorities of transportation policy:\n\n**&gt;&gt;** **Make transportation environmentally sustainable** – Reducing transportation's impact on the environment is critical to attacking global warming and other environmental problems. Transportation funds must be shifted away from highways — except for upkeep and maintenance — and toward public transit, bicycle lanes and improved pedestrian access. Public transit systems should phase out the use of polluting fossil fuels in favor of vehicles using electric power generated by non-polluting sources such as solar and wind power.\n\n**&gt;&gt; Bring people and transportation together** – Public transit works best when serving relatively dense, compact areas. Transit hubs should be targeted toward already built-up residential and commercial areas in central cities and inner suburbs. Areas that are already well-served by transit should be targeted for new housing and retail. Local communities should look to convert isolated, auto-dependent developments into more transit-friendly locations, as Tysons Corner is trying to do.\n\n**&gt;&gt; Target transit to low-income communities** – People with lower incomes are the most dependent on transit, but often the least well-served by it, while local governments sometimes give undue priority to gentrifying communities when planning new transit options. Alternatives to driving should be available to all, but a higher priority should be placed on serving the least-advantaged. Targeting rail and bus hubs to lower-income communities will help connect their residents to employment opportunities, as well as to health care and other services not available in their neighborhoods.\n\n**&gt;&gt;** **Keep public transit fares low** – Make transit affordable for low-income people and more attractive than driving. Farebox revenue should be supplemented with dedicated sources of funding established by the locality or region being served.\n\n**&gt;&gt; Include affordable housing in transit planning** – There is a tendency for improved transit to cause neighborhoods to gentrify, increasing housing costs and driving lower-income residents out. Local governments should ensure that a substantial percentage of housing in these areas is set aside for lower-income residents.\n\n**&gt;&gt; Make drivers pay the full cost of driving** – When gasoline prices increase, so do complaints from drivers. Yet if one factors in such costs as driving's impact on the environment, the cost of traffic accidents, and the law-enforcement/public works infrastructure needed to make road and highway transportation possible – not to mention the cost of our oil-driven Mideast wars – it's clear that the price at the pump, including taxes, constitutes only a fraction of the true social cost of driving. The federal gasoline tax, currently 18.4 cents a gallon, has not been increased since 1993. A combination of higher gasoline taxes, tolls and auto registration fees, with the proceeds targeted toward transit, bicycling facilities and pedestrian programs, can help correct this imbalance. In addition, emerging technology will allow local governments to record how many miles cars travel and enact fees on this basis, perhaps in lieu of gas taxes. Recognizing that many lower-income people drive and have little or no access to transit – due to their isolation or the unwillingness of their localities to provide adequate transit services to their communities – tax breaks or other allowances should be made to minimize the impact of higher auto fees on poor workers who must drive. However, the thrust of public policy must be to provide better transit to low-income communities, rather than create additional incentives to drive.\n\n**&gt;&gt; No more \"white men's highways in black men's bedrooms\"** – Low-income and minority communities must organize to ensure that they no longer suffer the undesirable impacts of transportation development – especially highways, but also bus garages, rail yards and other facilities incompatible with residential neighborhoods.\n\n**&gt;&gt; Reverse the trend toward privatization of public transit** – Communities are increasingly transferring transit services from public agencies to private corporations, arguing that the private sector can provide better service at lower cost. But experience has shown that privatization often costs the public more, while often failing to improve service quality and usually resulting in less public accountability – while enriching the owners of well-connected businesses that win the contracts. For example, a private firm won a contract to run Phoenix's bus system after putting the city's mayor and his girlfriend on the company's payroll; it subsequently demanded millions in extra payments on top of its contract and was fined for poor performance. Here in DC, plans are afoot to transfer some Metrobus routes to a private operator, an effort being challenged by the local bus drivers' union and its allies.\n\n**&gt;&gt; Beware of false solutions** – Measures such as better fuel economy, vehicles that run on fuels other than gasoline (such as electricity, ethanol or hydrogen), and the expanded presence of hybrid-fuel vehicles have been touted as ways to both minimize the environmental impact of the car and to conserve oil. However, all of these solutions presume continued dependence on cars and could [*encourage people to drive*](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/autos/2009-05-19-new-fuel-economy-standards_N.htm). Any environmental benefits from somewhat more eco-friendly cars must be weighed against their continued contribution to sprawl and the pressure for more roads and parking that they generate. In addition, to the extent that cars use gasoline, no matter how much more efficiently, they are still helping to exhaust the finite supply of oil. In the absence of planning for a future free of fossil fuels, conservation only postpones the inevitable.\n\nFor too long, progressives have sat on the sidelines as corporate interests have dictated the terms of America's transportation policy in the service of their own profit. The ability of the transportation system to move people and goods has often been an afterthought. Lower-income communities, where the need is greatest, have gotten the least benefit from transportation policy while suffering the greatest social and environmental costs. It is time for the people to reclaim transportation from the profit makers and to transform it into a path to mobility and opportunity.\n\n[*Why the US Doesn't Have a Labor Party and Australia does*](http://dsadc.org/why-the-us-doesnt-have-a-labor-party-and-australia-does/)\n\nMonday, September 1st, 2014\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;* Labor Day 2014**\n\n*By Jose Gutierrez*\n\n*&gt;&gt;* Robin Archer*: Why Is There No Labor Party in the United States?* (Princeton University Press 2010)\n\nIn 1906, Werner Sombart wrote*Why Is There No Socialism in the United States?* This book was the first of many that tried to explain why there is no mass socialist party in the United States. It emphasized the relative affluence of American workers in relation to their European counterparts.\n\nIn*Why Is There No Labor Party in the United States?*Robin Archer abandons comparisons with Europe or Canada. Archer makes a strong argument for adopting Australia as the \"most similar case\" to the US for the purpose of analyzing the variation from a comparable base.\n\nArcher uses the labor politics of the 1890s in both countries to illustrate the similarities and the differences between the two societies. He examines and assesses those categories that are traditionally cited as explaining the divergence of the US from other advanced capitalist societies. He concludes that for the most part these factors were equally applicable to the conditions prevailing in Australia during the 1890s at the very time when Australian unions decided to establish a labor party.\n\nIn stark contrast, American union leaders decided against such action despite experiencing the same conditions of industrial defeat and depression that had prompted their antipodean counterparts to opt for a party-based political strategy.\n\nMuch of the author's case rests on the argument that the labor movements in both countries were facing very similar challenges and opportunities in the 1890's. After that decade, conditions started diverging in a very pronounced way. However, in the 1890's it seemed that both countries might develop a labor party.\n\nArcher contests received common wisdom regarding why there is no labor or socialist party in the United States. It is often argued that the relative prosperity of the American working class reduced the perceived need for a working class party in the US. Archer points out that the Australian working class was as prosperous relative to the European working class.\n\nAnother argument is that American working class voters could vote and were not marginalized like they were in Europe but, again, that was also true in Australia. The electoral system of the US with its trademark first-past-the-post elections and single-member districts is cited as one of the explanations for the lack of a working class party. Meanwhile Australia, along with the UK, New Zealand and Canada, had the same voting systems, and yet labor parties developed in all of those countries. Moreover, European countries where socialism grew in strength also had first-past-the post-elections and single-member districts. Proportional systems developed later.\n\nArcher argues that racism was not one of the main stumbling blocks to the creation of a labor party in the 1890's. Racial hostility towards non-white workers was rampant in both Australia and the United States but in Australia it actually facilitated the creation of a labor party.\n\nAustralia actually had more workers who were foreign-born than the United States. Racial hostility towards southern and eastern European immigrants would be a major factor in both countries after the 1890's, but it wasn't an important factor in that decade, partly because immigrants from southern and eastern Europe were a small percentage of both countries' labor force at that time.\n\nArcher argues that the level of state repression that the labor movement faced was one of the factors that was different in the United States. It was in fact higher than in Australia and several Western European countries.\n\nReligious tensions were less important in Australia, but very significant in the US. The Australian working class was more secular and religion was not as divisive as it was in the United States. There was a real fear among American labor activists that a labor party would be wrecked by religious divisions but that trade-union organizing would not be as divisive.\n\nIn both countries, three American authors were at the height of their influence in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Edward Bellamy, author of *Looking Backward*; Henry George, writer of *Progress and Poverty* and Laurence Gronlund's *Co-operative Commonwealth* were well known among labor activists. They were more popular than the works of Marx or other European thinkers.\n\nAnother factor that was different in the United States was that German socialism had a greater impact. Marxism was a more important influence in the US than in Australia. Labor activists who were influenced by Marxism came to different conclusions. Some thought that creating a working-class party was paramount but others believed that trade union work needed to come first. Both sides would use Marx to defend their position. This sectarianism was absent in Australia. Some activists also feared that this ideological division would doom an American labor party.\n\nIt's interesting that in debunking certain arguments for exceptionalism Archer argues for a different version of exceptionalism. Nevertheless, Archer's innovative approach, together with the clarity of his arguments, should lead to questioning about the common wisdom in regard to why there is no labor party in the United States.","order":12},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—September 2014 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"September 2014","order":-1,"date":"2014-09-06","body":"**Welcome to the Labor Day 2014 issue of the *Washington Socialist*, the email newsletter of the DC Metro Local, Democratic Socialists of America.** This issue marks our second year of monthly publication, and the 16 articles (the most in any issue so far) we publish this month brings the total to 220.\n\nWhether we are simply long-winded or profound (and we have been both) this has been two years of keeping the socialist cause, ideals and analysis before a national capital that is ill-served by its capitalist media.

Less criticized was the double standard behind those lies, the double standard by which we sit in judgment over others without allowing ourselves to be judged. Thus the horror of chemical and nuclear arms, the horror of indiscriminate bombing, of the killing of non-combatants, is only condemned as horrible by government and most media when engaged in by those we label enemy. They are not judged so horrible, so random, so worthy of sanction when conducted by those our government labels friend, or when a consequence of our own official actions. It is a double standard we can see domestically when the protection given to prosecutorial misconduct, to police and – as seen in George Zimmerman's murder of Trayvon Martin – vigilante violence, is contrasted with the relentless US criminal justice machine that continues to put unending numbers of individuals behind lock and key, often for non-violent charges. And it is a double standard in evidence when the fig leaf of national security and safety from terrorism is used to justify military action abroad joined to domestic civil liberties restrictions.\n\nAn example of the hypocrisy this entails is evident in the case of the Cuban Five. The FBI's accusation: they threatened US national security. Their actions: trying to protect Cuba from terrorist bombings planned and financed by anti-Castro exiles in Miami. The consequence: Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon Labanino, Antonio Guerrero, Fernando Gonzalez and Rene Gonzalez were arrested in Florida in 1998 on espionage charges and handed prison terms ranging from 15 years (Rene Gonzalez with that \"short\" sentence has been released) to the life sentence imposed on Gerardo Hernandez.\n\nIndeed they were Cuban intelligence officers, but the goal they sought was not to prepare an attack on another country but rather to defend their own society. The sentences were so long because prosecutors were not content to charge them with the relatively minor counts of being unregistered agents of a foreign government and use of false identities – charges of which they were guilty but would not have resulted in the desired harsh sentences. So prosecutors added the charge of \"conspiracy to gather and transmit national defense information\" – a convenient charge making conviction relatively easy, as it does not require the US government to even pretend that they actually did gather or transmit such information.\n\nThe practice of criminal charges becoming more draconian once defendants use the courts to defend themselves is a common practice as anyone familiar with how our legal system actually works can attest. And it is the reason Hernandez was given two life sentences. More than a year after his arrest he faced the additional charge of murder for the deaths of two anti-Castro pilots shot down over Cuban territory, based on political calculation not on any new evidence. However one judges the Cuban action, Hernandez neither shot them down, was part of the decision to do so nor gave the order, but such facts are irrelevant when the goal is punishment not justice. And the amorphous nature of conspiracy charges made proving unprovable facts completely unnecessary.\n\n**An Anniversary** Marking the 15th anniversary of their incarceration, Stephen Kimber, the Canadian author of *What Lies Across the Water: The Real Story of the Cuban Five*, recently spoke about the case in Washington, DC and Columbia, Maryland. The tour, sponsored by the International Committee to Defend the Cuban Five, was part of an effort to bring about greater public awareness of the human costs of this particular \"defense\" of our nation's \"national security.\" Kimber documents the activities of Cuban intelligence apparatus, of the five who were condemned by our courts as guilty, against threats that were anything but abstract. In the early 1990s there was a wave of hotel bombings in Cuba, bombings designed to terrorize people visiting the country. This was \"strategic\" terror, directed at upending Cuba's attempt to build a tourist industry as a step toward reviving its economy — then at a low ebb, having lost its key trading partners after the collapse of the Soviet Union while still suffering from the tightening grip of the US blockade. It was a time too when those exile groups were stepping up their activities, ignoring questions of national sovereignty, in the expectation that the Cuban government would soon fall. Thus private planes flew from Florida over Cuban territory without authorization, an action illegal under US law, but a law unenforced for two linked reasons. First, because the target was a Cuban government that survived when other socialist governments failed. Second, because the exile community in Miami, though still a vehicle of US foreign policy, had also acquired power of its own. Cold War anti-Communism did not end with the end of the Cold War.\n\nThe fact that the US government was neither investigating nor prosecuting those who engaged in illegal acts against Cuba from our own soil was the reason for the dispatch of Cuban agents to Florida. They were in no way an attempt to attack or subvert the US, an absurdity on its face given the relative sizes, economic and military strength of the two countries, and an absurdity given US global predominance and Cuban isolation in the 1990s. It is also contrary to what the Cuban government did. As details of planned violent actions against Cuba were uncovered based on evidence furnished by infiltration into exile groups, Cuban authorities attempted to get the US government to intercede.\n\nKimber describes how Fidel Castro reached out to President Bill Clinton through their mutual friend, novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez, offering to provide information on violent activities emanating from within the US. The Clinton Administration responded positively. A team of FBI agents came to Havana where they were provided with extensive documentation of past and planned attacks. Follow-up action was promised by the FBI. But the action taken was not what was expected for the violent exile groups were left untouched. Instead, several months later, the Cuban agents were arrested. In a sense the victim of terrorist attacks was made to pay the price – another example of the agencies of the powerful holding themselves to different standards than those applied to all others. It was a betrayal of trust that speaks to complicity in anti-Cuban violence, and a betrayal that came at a terrible human cost to the Cuban Five and their families. And, not incidentally, the arrests also prevented the realization of any potential thawing of relations between the two countries represented by anti-terrorist cooperation.\n\nFurther underlining the hypocrisy, the US government has given safe haven to two of the most notorious of the anti-Cuban terrorists — Orlando Bosch (who passed away, never prosecuted let alone confined, in 2011) and Luis Posada Carriles, (living still as a free man in Miami). Posada was implicated in the hotel bombings in the 1990s, and the two of them were implicated in the bombing of a Cuban civilian airliner in 1976, killing all 73 aboard. But when such actions are taken against an \"enemy,\" they become acceptable or, at least, accepted. Approximately 3,000 Cubans have lost their lives in bombing attacks over the past decades, attacks our official double standard refuses to acknowledge.\n\nAs might be expected of a case such as this, numerous jurists and bodies ranging from the UN Commission on Human Rights to Amnesty International have condemned the trial of the Cuban Five as unfair, the sentences vindictive. Appeals continue, however – appeals strengthened by ever new revelations of just how unfair. It's been discovered that federal government funds were used to pay reporters in Miami during the trial to further inflame public opinion and influence the unsequestered jury members — payments which neither the Five, their attorneys nor the judge were informed of at the time. Legal actions on their behalf are joined to attempts to build a broad-based international campaign to win their release from prison and quicken their return to their homes and families in Cuba. From May 30-June 4, numerous public events were held in Washington DC as part of \"Five Days for the Five\" with speakers including Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers Union and an Honorary Chair of DSA, former US Attorney General Ramsay Clark, Angela Davis, Danny Glover, Rev. Graylan Hagler, the late Saul Landau and many others in events to strengthen the public movement on their behalf. Solidarity actions have been especially strong in Latin America where most governments have called for freedom for the Five, and in Africa where memory of Cuba's role in opposing apartheid is well-remembered. In Europe too there has been much action – 116 Members of Parliament in Britain signed a statement earlier this year demanding that the imprisoned Cubans be allowed family visits, a right frequently denied.\n\nAnd actions continue. On the fifth of each month, some public figure writes an open letter calling for freedom for the Five; this October 5th that initiative was expanded through an organized campaign to get as many individuals as possible to e-mail, call, or write the White House, demanding that President Obama free the four remaining Cuban prisoners.\n\n**What is to be done** Yet after five years of imprisonment the case is still too little known in the United States, and support for the Five still not strong enough to gain their release. Part of the difficulty lies in the success of anti-Cuban policies that have made a neighbor 90 miles from our shore an unknown to most. On June 3, as part of the \"Five Days for the Five,\" a labor solidarity event took place at the Local 140 American Postal Workers union hall in Northeast DC. Canadian and British unionists talked about the success they have had in bringing their respective labor movements around to support demands to free the unjustly imprisoned Cubans. It wasn't easy and the task is far from complete, but more progress has been made in those and other countries' labor movements than in the US for one significant reason: Other countries have diplomatic relations with Cuba, allowing for visits, allowing – for example – family members of the imprisoned five to talk about the case giving a human dimension. Here such talks are impossible. Some of those family members not granted visas to come to the US to visit loved ones (the ban British parliamentarians criticized); those who are allowed can only visit, unable to speak to the press or the public. So too, delegations of Cuban unionists can travel to other countries but are banned from our shores – and approval for US citizens to go to Cuba is difficult and potentially liable to sanction. Local 140 President Dena Brisco talked of her trip to Cuba and how it gave her new insights. But the nature of the ban makes such visits themselves too infrequent, possible on too small a scale.\n\nThus the question of why persists – why government policy has been so consistently hostile to Cuba since the 1959 revolution, why the need for Cuba to send agents here to monitor the acts of its violent opponents, why those agents when arrested were given such draconian sentences, why those culpable of violence were left free. Cuban socialism in its strengths and weaknesses, in its changes and developments is simply an unknown reality to the vast majority of people in Florida or Washington, DC or anywhere else in our country. Kimber in his presentation noted that when he began writing his book; he expected others to have already written about the case – then discovered to his surprise that no detailed book on the subject had appeared in the US. No longer surprised, he then discovered how difficult it has been to get the book reviewed and sold here.\n\nFor all our claims to be an \"Open Society,\" we can be pretty closed when it comes to allowing the voices to be heard of those who are designated as enemy. It is the same logic that allows US intelligence agencies to monitor private conversations around the world – and act aggrieved when that monitoring is publicly revealed. Not just aggrieved, as indicated\nby the sentence imposed on Chelsea Manning and the attempted\nprosecutions of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden. The lack of information about Cuba, about the Cuban Five is part and parcel of the way in which the American public is kept uniformed about the purposes and consequences of US foreign policy as a whole.\n\nThat consequence is evident on Guantanamo, a piece of Cuban territory leased indefinitely to the US when the country was a virtual colony and now a land of legal limbo where human beings are held indefinitely. There too human beings are caught in a vise that is all too often ignored because cardboard images replace the fuller understanding of the persons, of the families, impacted by incarceration. British journalist Victoria Brittain puts in her book *Shadow Lives* personalities and lives that our hypocritical war on terror refuses to recognize, providing \"a glimpse into the world of a number of women who have had their lives shattered by the myths and fable generated by the war on terror ...\" Giving human dimension to those otherwise seen as cardboard figures is itself a challenge to the way official policies of war and repression are justified and rationalized.\n\nThe Cubans who were fighting terrorist attacks against their own countries and those imprisoned in Guantanamo – many, though not all, who certainly viewed terror as an appropriate means of struggle – represent different world views, different concepts of how to change the world. But what they share is suffering the fate of a double standard that justifies the politics of empire and civil liberties abuse in the name of a democracy that is itself ever more restricted. And we just survived an attempt to have our rights, and indeed our freedom, even more restricted, as seen by the recent attempt by a minority of a minority to impose its will on the whole country by shutting down the federal government.\n\nThere is a connection to be made there – a connection between repressive global politics, the use of courts as vehicles of political and social repression and attacks on popular government. During the labor meeting on Cuba, one of the speakers from the floor made the point – not recognized nearly enough — that civil liberties is a working class issue which needs to be defended as such. The fate of Gerardo Hernandez, Ramon Labanino, Antonio Guerrero, Fernando Gonzalez and Rene Gonzalez may appear distant from the needs of people who are struggling with housing costs, trying to find or hold onto jobs, figuring out how to meet health care needs or address pension worries. But the expansion of laws that criminalize nonviolent behavior, that make prosecutions easier, sentences longer and appeals more difficult contribute to the climate that has weakened labor organization, weakened movements of public protest, and weakened the left. It is not a step removed, it is the other side of the same struggle.\n\nConspiracy laws, in particular, are laws that criminalize by association and have been used to both repress individual rights and to marginalize groups and organizations deemed objectionable by those in power. The criminal justice system has devastated African-American and Latino communities, has created a climate of fear in immigrant communities, and has served as tool of political repression as seen with the fate of the Occupy movement. Meanwhile that system has ignored the practices that have shipped jobs overseas, created financial havoc, taken families' homes, jobs, futures – all practices akin to the use/misuse of law that enables employers to violate labor protections with impunity while making workers' rights ever less likely to be enforced.\n\n**Solidarity** \"They \\[the Cuban Five\\] have already had to endure the most difficult conditions: solitary confinement, restrictions on communication and family visits, loneliness, and psychological torture. It is cruel when there is a family loss and one cannot be present – and \\[when one\\] must also not show sorrow, because in all spheres \\[of life\\] caution must be exercised.\n\n\"The US authorities have denied me a visa to travel in the US to visit my husband. The argument is always that I am a security risk. ... So long as there is no definitive solution to the case, we demand at least the right to have regular visits. But more important than the visa question is that they finally be allowed to return home.\"\n\nAndriana Perez – Gerardo Hernandez' wife – has become a global leader in the solidarity campaign. She made those remarks while in Germany and they serve as a reminder of the hurts inherent to the lives of those imprisoned, a reminder that while the campaign to free the Cuban Five should be seen as part of the broader fight to retake and remake our society, it should also be seen as a profoundly human movement calling for justice for victims of injustice. Their story, after all is a story also of families, of children growing up without their fathers, of loved ones separated by miles and bars, of celebrations and funerals and daily events missed – of people working to keep hope alive, to remain engaged with the world and with life and with each other. It is a struggle that deserves respect and support on those terms alone.\n\nThe fate of Howard Wallace, a Black Panther activist arrested in 1972, and allowed three days of freedom before his death from cancer at age 72 after having spent 40 years in solitary confinement based on unproven charges is a fate that should never be repeated. And so the importance of solidarity efforts on behalf of Leonard Peltier, on behalf of Mumia Abu Jamal, on behalf of lesser known victims of official injustice – and on behalf of the Cuban Five. Such campaigns can be long and seem hopeless, but hope departs only when people turn their eyes away instead of acting on what they see. Perhaps it is best to end with word of the late Leonard Weinglass, an attorney for Daniel Ellsburg and many others, his last work being working to win freedom for the Five:\n\n\"The worst thing that can happen to anyone in the American system of justice is to be alone. Solidarity is necessary, not to intimidate the Court. But to indicate that the world is watching and the law should be followed.\"\n\nSolidarity is the means by which we can create a single standard of justice, can build a just society, a just world.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nStephen Kimber, *What Lies Across the Water: The Real Story of the Cuban Five,* Fernwood Publishing, 2013.

As the standoff dragged on into a second and third week, the parallel story of whether Congress would bring financial ruin on the country by refusing to extend the federal debt ceiling came to the fore. Much was made of the closure of federal museums and monuments and their impact on the tourist trade. There was, however, another local angle to this tale of federal Washington's dysfunction: the impact of the shutdown on the District of Columbia, the real city of 630,000 people often overshadowed by the often-unreal antics of the national government within its boundaries.\n\nDue to the Constitution's specifying that \"Congress shall have power ... \\[t\\]o exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever\" over the federal district housing the seat of government, Congress must approve the District's budget every year before DC can spend any funds, as if it were a federal agency. This is despite the fact that, like nearly all states and cities, the vast majority of the District government's funding – about three-fourths – comes from taxes raised by the District government itself – income taxes, sales and excise taxes, and the other levies. Nevertheless, because Congress controls the District's legislation, DC requires congressional approval to spend even its own locally raised tax money. In effect, Congress is the schoolyard bully who steals a child's lunch money and says that maybe he'll give it back if the victim asks for it nicely enough.\n\nWhen Oct. 1 arrived and there was no approved budget – for federal agencies or the DC government – DC Mayor Vincent C. Gray, rather than bow to Congress and close shop, scrambled to keep the District government running. Because heads of federal agencies have discretion to declare certain employees \"essential,\" Gray decided that all DC government employees fit this description and kept them all on the job. To pay their salaries and the operational costs of the local government, he dipped into a \"rainy-day fund\" that could keep the District operating for perhaps two or three weeks.\n\nGray also went public with his frustration over the District's entanglement in a dispute to which it should not have been party, and on Oct. 9 held a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to demand that Congress free DC's budget from the impasse. By that time the Republican-controlled House, as part of its strategy to gain public favor by selectively approving funding for a few popular programs – and holding the rest hostage in exchange for concessions on Obamacare – had passed a budget for the District. But the Democratic-controlled Senate insisted that the entire government be funded at once and without conditions, and refused to vote on a DC-only bill. By coincidence, at the time Gray was holding his press conference, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was holding his own media powwow nearby. Gray, spotting Reid, walked over to him and, according to the *Washington Post*, said in the presence of the reporters, \"Sir, we are not a department of the government. We're simply trying to be able to spend our own money.\" To which Reid replied, \"I'm on your side, don't screw it up, okay?\"\n\nGray continued his offensive the following evening with a public meeting at Friendship Public Charter School in Southeast DC. With several hundred DC residents in attendance, he discussed the difficulties the District would face if Congress did not approve its funding promptly. He said the District had already missed a $90 million payment to Medicaid providers due to lack of money, and more cutbacks would be necessary within days as the reserve fund emptied.\n\nFortunately, the Tea Party faction caved on Oct. 16, and DC once again had full access to its own funds. And Congress, which took no pains to prevent disruption of the District's government in October, threw the capital city a bone: DC could spend its funds through next September, although the federal government may face another budget crisis in January. That DC should consider itself \"fortunate\" to be able to spend its own money for another 11 months before once again throwing itself on the mercy of Congress aptly illustrates the absurdity of the District's colonial status.\n\nAlmost since DC gained limited home rule in 1974, District citizens have fought, lobbied and pleaded for the two essential features of American democracy that all other US citizens enjoy but DC residents are denied: voting representation in Congress, and what can be called \"states' rights:\" local control over local legislation and spending. The voting representation struggle has absorbed the most energy and produced the most ink, from the failed attempt to amend the Constitution in the 1970s and 1980s to the more recent, and equally frustrated, attempt to gain voting representation by simple legislation.\n\nThe push for legislative and budget autonomy, while lower-burning than the voting representation fight, has nevertheless been regarded as of equal importance by many DC residents and activists. The lack of autonomy was especially deeply felt in 1997 when Congress, largely to punish the District for re-electing Marion Barry as mayor, stripped the elected government of nearly all its rights and vested authority in the congressionally appointed Control Board. Citizen anger over this insult to democracy led to a surge of activism in support of defending and expanding home rule. One product of this new activism was a bus caravan to the North Carolina district of Sen. Lauch Faircloth, the architect of the 1997 measure. The riders' work in educating Faircloth's mostly working-class constituents was certainly a factor in the senator's defeat for re-election the following year. Another product of the 1997 uprising was the founding of the Stand Up! for Democracy in DC Coalition (also known as Free DC) which became the standard-bearer for the most comprehensive solution to DC's disenfranchisement: statehood. (The local chapter of Democratic Socialists of America was one of the founding organizations of the coalition).\n\nAs advocates have argued, only statehood will confer full citizenship equal to that of all other US citizens – since, as even a cursory reading of the Constitution makes clear, the United States is a federation of states, and full citizenship flows from being the resident of a state. Any law or constitutional amendment to remedy DC's disenfranchisement, short of full statehood, would confer only citizenship with an asterisk.\n\nThis points out a flaw in the DC referendum, approved last April by DC voters, that essentially declares budget autonomy unilaterally and while daring Congress to shoot it down. While the vote represents a feisty middle finger thrust at Capitol Hill, even DC's own attorney general has declared it of dubious legality, and Congress could overturn it at any time.\n\nIn the end, only statehood will grant the full voting rights, full legislative autonomy and full respect that the District deserves and needs. While procedurally easy to attain – it requires only a majority vote in both houses of Congress and the signature of the President – it has been a struggle politically. It has come to a floor vote only once, in the House of Representatives in 1993, and lost by a wide margin. Clearly, the statehood movement has more work to do to educate the public about why DC needs and deserves statehood – not only the residents of the states with voting representatives, but those living in DC as well. Only a stronger, more visible and more aggressive movement will capture the attention of the nation – and prevent an inevitable replay of the outrageous events of October 2013.\n\nFor more information on the DC statehood movement, visit [*www.freedc.org*](http://www.freedc.org).","order":2},{"title":"Maryland looks at formal state body on defense transition","date":"2013-10-31","issue":"November 2013","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"Progressive groups and some like-minded legislators in Maryland are pushing a bill for the January 2014 session to create an economic futures commission to retain and expand the state's high-pay manufacturing base and jobs – especially as military outlays are projected to decline.\n\nThe state would attempt, through this group, systematic planning to not only ride out but benefit from the decline in defense spending likely in the next decade. Preparing the state's workers and their skills for alternative production – including specific green energy manufacture and creation – tops the agenda.\n\nAt a meeting in Columbia Oct. 30, activists from around the state, officials from unions and progressive NGOs and a legislative sponsor heard more.\n\nJean Athey, chair of [*Fund Our Communities Maryland,*](http://ourfunds.org/) outlined the state's dependency on military spending and the higher economic stimulus resulting from federal dollars devoted to non-military projects such as infrastructure, health care and education.\n\nThe draft bill's preamble cites a study suggesting that in 2013 alone the \"sequestration\" budget cuts will cost the state nearly 30,000 jobs and $2.5 billion-plus in Gross State Product.\n\nA panel discussion followed, including bill co-sponsor Sen. Roger Manno of Montgomery County's 19<sup>th</sup> Dist. and state AFL-CIO president Fred Mason. Mason said that Maryland, through lack of planning, was unable to benefit from the 60,000 new jobs resulting from the last round of base closings, and wound up having to recruit workers from New Jersey, original loser of many of the jobs.\n\nThe legislative effort for the bill would be \"an uphill fight\" but a \"fight worth having,\" Mason said, because it would \"get citizens to look at their future more strategically.\" Planning would help the state \"escape the whims of corporations that put profits over people.\"\n\nThe stated goal: \"...to develop plans and policies to ensure a competitive advantage for Maryland as Federal military spending declines.\" The draft bill actually contains the phrase \"industrial policy,\" a term nearly eradicated by the Reagan-era elevation of laissez-faire capitalism as policy.\n\nFund Our Communities Maryland's main mission is to reduce Pentagon spending and divert that money to human needs, at state and local as well as national levels.\n\nHowever, Manno, who will co-sponsor the bill in the Senate along with fellow Montgomery Sens. Richard Madaleno and Jamie Raskin, said as written the bill would \"not be a heavy lift\" in the legislature because it avoids direct confrontation with defense industry interests, instead focusing on job creation and countering job loss. He appealed for early and wide support from activists.\n\n\"We need a caucus,\" Manno said, \"to be strategic how we roll out a new economy\" so that progressive and union interests are not \"pitted against each other.\"\n\nMason reported that the state AFL-CIO had passed a resolution in favor of examining economic conversion Oct. 26. The resolution noted \"growing need for programs of economic conversion\" and said \"appropriate planning and foresight is needed\" for worker transition as the state's job sources change.\n\nAn earlier draft of the AFL-CIO resolution had explicitly endorsed, and promised support for, legislation for the Commission for Maryland's Future by name because \"there is no state planning body\" to take on the task. The draft also promised an internal AFL-CIO working group to encourage and educate on the matter at the county and community level. That language did not survive; instead the operative phrase was that the Maryland AFL-CIO \"recognizes the seriousness of these issues,\" and that labor representatives on existing state and local area Workforce Investment Boards are \"encourage\\[d\\] ... to use their voice to ensure that these issues are addressed.\"\n\nThe dozens of members of the \"Commission for Maryland's Future\" would, in the draft bill, include representatives from labor, peace, environmental and economic policy organizations. Administrative support would come from the committee's inclusion of top officials from major state agencies and task forces overseeing economic and workforce development, climate change and sustainable growth, STEM education and manufacturing competitiveness. Nonprofit NGOs and advocacy groups are also well represented, at least in the draft.\n\nThe strategies to be sought by the commission include \"the coordination of economic development policy with capital investment in both public and private sectors\" and \"the diversification or conversion of defense-related jobs with an emphasis on encouraging environmentally sustainable and civilian-product manufacturing jobs.\"\n\nAnd on the to-do list: \"the diversification or conversion of defense-related jobs; ... planning for and development of the state's manufacturing base; ... creation and implementation of an *industrial policy* \\[emphasis added\\] for the state that is environmentally friendly; and ... the creation of a business climate in the state conducive to long-term planning and capital investment.\"\n\nA [*study*](http://www.ciponline.org/images/uploads/publications/Milex_Jobs_Fact_Sheet_0212_Update.pdf) at the Political Economic Research Institute at U-Mass Amherst by defense scholar William Hartung demonstrated that military manufacturing jobs contribute less to economic prosperity than do job in manufacturing for civilian consumption – because the civilian products cycle through the civilian economy rather than being shunted off into the sealed-off world of military use.\n\nHartung notes that \"spending on clean energy production produces one and one-half times more jobs \\[than military manufacturing\\] and spending on education creates more than two and one-half times more jobs.\"\n\nAs important, Hartung says, is who benefits from military contracting. It's not the workers. \"... more of the military dollar goes to capital, as opposed to labor, than do the expenditures in the other job categories. For example, only 1.5% of the price of each F-35 Joint Strike Fighter pays for the labor costs involved in \"manufacturing, fabrication, and assembly\" work at the plane's main production facility in Fort Worth, Texas.2 A full 85% of the F-35s costs go for overhead, not for jobs actually fabricating and assembling the aircraft.\"\n\nA similar transition commission was established by law in Connecticut earlier this year, but Maryland would be a pioneer in this project, said Miriam Pemberton, a defense scholar at the [*Institute for Policy Studies*](http://www.ips-dc.org/) who is advising Fund Our Communities Maryland on the issue, and who was on the Oct. 30 meeting's panel.\n\nShe suggested that activists and legislators avoid some pitfalls by taking testimony from industry representatives, examine the history of conversion efforts – which show some successes – and focus on the most promising alternatives, such as clean energy to combat climate change.\n\nConnecticut's bill reads like a more traditional industrial-policy bill, with a focus on state intervention to stimulate high-paying manufacturing employment. An acknowledgment that defense industry declines should be countered by creation of green jobs comes only as an amendment to the original text.\n\nOne potential resource, Pemberton said, is actually in the Pentagon – the Office of Economic Adjustment, which is shifting its focus from base closings to the disruptions that cuts in military spending can bring to local communities. Noncompetitive grants are available to communities, such as counties, that can demonstrate dependence on defense jobs and spending at levels as low as 3% of the total local economy.\n\nPemberton noted with resignation that federal legislative action on conversion was probably unlikely given congressional gridlock, and said in discussion after the meeting that similar state action is under consideration in Ohio, Michigan and Missouri, but that Maryland looked like the next state after Connecticut to get a bill in the process.","order":3},{"title":"NATIONAL CONVENTION NOTES: Setting Socialist Strategy in an Age of Austerity","date":"2013-10-31","issue":"November 2013","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"How should DSA position itself to pursue democratic socialist goals in an era of deepening economic austerity?\n\nWhat should our organization's key priorities be as we go about rebuilding a democratic left over the next two years?\n\nWho should we attempt to ally ourselves with as we go about trying to form – or many would say, re-establish – a democratic and progressive coalition for change?\n\nHow do we do all that at a time when the Tea Party right apparently still controls the House of Representatives, Republican governors and gerrymandered legislatures in many states are curtailing labor rights and imposing new voting restrictions on minority Americans, and chronic budget gridlock threatens the future of federal spending programs to help the poor, the unemployed and the disabled — not to mention Social Security and Medicare?\n\n\n\nThese were some of the major issues that democratic socialists from around the country grappled with as we met at a unionized Hilton hotel in Emeryville, California on Oct. 24-Oct. 27 for DSA's biennial national convention.\n\nAs one of three delegates from the Metro DC chapter of DSA to attend the convention, I confess to having been too jet-lagged to attend many of the many workshops at the event. However, I was very impressed – far more than I'd expected to be, in fact – by Joe Schwartz's presentation at the Saturday morning plenary session on Oct. 26 on \"The Role of a Socialist Organization in an Era of Austerity.\" I think Joe's presentation and the breakout discussion panels that followed it did a good job of summarizing many of the challenges facing democratic socialists and the U.S. left as a whole in the coming years.\n\nOne central theme of Joe's vision, as he indicated at a Socialist Salon here in Washington some months ago, is the challenge to traditional New Deal liberalism in the US by what leftwing analysts generally called \"neo-liberalism,\" which is basically equivalent to libertarian-style, free-market fundamentalism.\n\nAs most DSA members are doubtless aware, but as some newer recruits to democratic socialism may not understand (given the way that words are employed in American public schools and on the mass media), \"liberal\" as neo-liberal thinkers define the word is essentially equivalent to favoring \"liberty\" – the two words are from the same Latin root.\n\nBut the so-called Classical Liberals of the 19<sup>th</sup> century were most determined to extend \"liberty\" to capitalist enterprises, and modern neo-liberals and the libertarian economists they follow are the same. Their \"liberal\" vision of a totally free capitalist marketplace therefore would sound the death knell for the \"liberal\" New Deal programs established in the 1930s and for the civil rights laws and environmental protection laws that many liberal Democrats in the US supported in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nAs Joe noted in his plenary session talk on the challenges facing socialists in the current age of austerity, \"Neo-liberalism is a class project to redistribute power and wealth in America – upwards.\" And it has enjoyed remarkable political success over the past several decades, to the point where 20% of this country's households are doing very well financially, but perhaps 80% of the working people in the US are struggling to make ends meet.\n\nNeo-liberal politics as it has been pursued mostly by Republican presidents and members of Congress, but with ample help from so-called moderate Democrats, has helped ensure that since the late 1970s, the pre-tax income of the richest 1% of Americans has risen from about 8.7% of the total GDP to some 23%.\n\nMeanwhile, as Joe noted in his plenary address, inflation-adjusted wages of men without school degrees have plunged by 12%, and only through a massive influx of women into the workforce has the median household income been able to increase by about 17%, at a time when total economic output in the country more than doubled.\n\nLargely as a result of neo-liberal and anti-regulatory politics, coupled with unequal cuts in income tax rates and state and federal budget cuts aimed at the least fortunate, unemployment and under-employment in the US have been rising, and at the same time many Baby Boomers have lost the protection that they once enjoyed of guaranteed pension payments in their retirement years.\n\nMeanwhile the deindustrialization of the American economy has pushed many older white workers out of factory jobs into much lower-paying jobs in the service sector, or into surviving on disability payments. And despite some very impressive gains by the black middle class since the 1970s, many lower-income African American men have been hurt even worse by deindustrialization than their white counterparts, and have been pushed into surviving on welfare benefits, working in the underground economy, or spending years on end in prison.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Joe argued in his talk on socialist strategy, American leftists need to be fighting not only to preserve the public sector in the U.S. economy, but to expand it. We need to fight against the divisions that neo-liberal politicians are trying to create between the middle class and the poor and among Americans of different racial backgrounds and national origins.\n\nWe further need to fight against the ongoing de-unionizing of the American workplace and the deregulation of industry, while understanding and strongly contesting the right-wing idea that somehow, the richest capitalist nation on earth can't afford a strong and humane public sector.\n\nSocialists and our progressive allies should \"go beyond saving Social Security to expanding Social Security,\" Joe urged delegates at the convention, and given the high and rising productivity of US capitalist workplaces, we should demand and win paid parental and maternity leave for all workers.\n\nOver the next few years democratic socialists also should be pushing hard for the creation of new jobs, especially government-provided jobs, through federal and state programs to promote green industry, build and improve mass transit systems, and address a huge crisis in decaying public infrastructure systems around the country.\n\nTwo other major crises Joe mentioned in his plenary presentation were the burgeoning burden of student loan debt, on the one hand, and a huge shortfall in the public sector budgets for funding the pension and retirement benefits of existing public sector workers.\n\nTo address national problems like these on a scale where actual victories are possible, Joe further argued, \"We have to build a new rainbow coalition\" in the U.S., one that will \"build solidarity without neglecting differences\" among the many different communities that are currently suffering from neo-liberal austerity.\n\nJoe is on record, along with a majority of the National Political Committee and the DSA national office, as calling for DSA at a national level to make the campaign to reform the student debt our only \"supported\" priority over the next two years.\n\nThat is, they hope for the DSA national office to devote its limited staff resources and financial resources to the student debt campaign alone, partly on the grounds that focusing on student debt will enable DSA to recruit younger members who can stave off the collapse of this organization when older DSA members – at present, more than half of the total DSA membership is near or past retirement age – are forced to abandon politics in years ahead due to old age, disability and death.\n\nAdvocates for this focus on student debt hope that by devoting major organizational resources to recruiting young people without explicitly socialist politics to DSA, and by educating them and their often financially beleaguered parents about the total extent of U.S. student loan debt and how it is feeding the profits of the private financial system, democratic socialists can build a greater public awareness of the capitalist contradictions in the banking system, as well as the need for the education of young Americans to be removed from the auspices of private, profit-seeking corporations and recognized as a necessary social program of a humane and democratic society.\n\nAnother critical focus of Joe's vision in his plenary address on socialist strategy, and a key point of a national DSA priorities document that delegates debated and approved on the last day of the convention, is greater DSA involvement in the immigrant rights and immigration reform movement.\n\nThe recruitment of younger college-age and post-college age people through the student debt campaign, and the recruitment of young and older immigrants through progressive involvement in the immigrant rights struggle, will together help DSA to establish the foundations for the next American left, as Joe and many others on the National Political Committee see it.\n\nHowever, it became clear in Joe's plenary talk and in the panel discussions that followed it that at a local level, DSA members are expected to remain engaged in many other local and national struggles against austerity and neo-liberalism. Not only students and immigrants, but low-wage workers generally, aging folk facing cutbacks, women and minorities, and union or union-recruitable white men could be parts of a possible anti-austerity coalition of the left\n\nA final point that Joe's plenary address mentioned, and that also is included in the priorities resolution that convention delegates approved on Sunday, Oct. 27, was that as we fight against the austerity politics of the right, democratic socialists also should be engaging in strong public education efforts both about the flaws in neo-liberalism and in capitalism as it exists today, and concerning possible socialist alternatives to the system.\n\nFor the past several months, there has been something of a national debate among some long-time DSA activists over the relative strengths of (1) an \"organize, organize\" strategy to fight the neo-liberal fights – a strategy that will necessitate DSA, with its relatively small numbers, entering into practical alliances with many activists who do not have an explicitly socialist understanding of the problems, and who are working for liberal reforms and not wholesale economic transformation to fix those problems, and (2) a rather different possible strategy that would involve DSA attempting to leverage its relatively small membership to publicize radical critiques of the system – critiques calling for non-capitalist solutions to our society's woes.\n\nIn Joe's plenary address on socialist strategy and again in the priorities resolution approved on Oct. 27, a dual approach to strategy was essentially endorsed. That is, it was decided that DSA should join with various activist organizations fighting against neo-liberal austerity, including liberal organizations and labor and community groups lacking any kind of socialist ideology. But at the same time, we should work to educate our coalition partners and the public at large about a deeper socialist analysis of the current economic slump and long-term alternatives to it. In this way, the final priorities resolution that the delegates approved on Oct. 27, the last day of the convention, partly transcended the clashing priorities of the \"organize, organize\" school and the \"educate, educate\" school in DSA by calling on members and DSA local chapters to do both, and to do so in coordinated fashion.\n\nAn important amendment to the priorities document that was proposed by DSA's former national director Frank Llewellyn and approved on Oct. 27 calls on DSA members and chapters, at least at the local level, to address the crisis in political democracy symbolized by ongoing efforts to restrict minority and low-income voting participation, to free wealthy corporations from any social controls over their campaign contributions, as the Supreme Court largely accomplished under its notorious Citizens United decision, and to restrict popular political participation in other ways while privileging that of the wealthy and the corporations.\n\nDSA is hardly an authoritarian organization that has any ability, or for that matter any intent, of imposing a \"party line\" on individual chapters or individual members who dissent from the choices made by the national office, the NPC, or for that matter the decisions of the national convention. What was stated in the plenary sessions and voted on by the delegates in Emeryville in late October need not be binding on those of us in the Metro DC chapter. But in my opinion, the vision that Joe laid out in his socialist strategy address and that was embedded in the priorities statement that delegates approved on the last day of the convention offers some very promising guidelines on how DSAers and other progressives can go about battling against right-wing austerity politics in the months and years to come.\n\n***Andy Feeney** is a Metro DC DSA steering committee member and was a local delegate to the DSA national convention in Oakland, Calif.

Socialism is a choice, its vision never permanently secured.\"\n\n\"Toward Freedom\" argued in favor of the continued relevance of Marxism at a time when many thought it was not and instead celebrated \"The End of History\".\n\nThe document also argued that even under worker self-management, there would be a need for political pluralism.\n\n\"Toward Freedom\" argued that there would be areas of expertise and job specialization under socialism, but these matters should be decided democratically. The rotation of menial tasks, frequent sabbaticals, job retraining, a shorter work week, more leisure is also proposed.\n\nThe importance of a coalition strategy is emphasized.\n\nThe document argues that Marx was overly optimistic about the development of class consciousness.\n\nIt also argues that in no country has there been a mobilized, conscious majority for socialism and asks why.\n\nThe reasons for this lack of support are the association of socialism with authoritarian communism, the post World War II prosperity and welfare state and finally the possibility of a capital strike where new investment is withheld or flees countries. Chile under Salvador Allende and France under Francois Mitterrand are often mentioned as examples of a capital strike.\n\nIt is interesting to note that two of these factors are but a memory. The Soviet Union ceased to exist over twenty years ago, and the wage of the average American has stagnated since 1973. Perhaps this one of the reasons why opinion polls show increased support for socialism in the United States, in particular among young people.\n\nA left coalition would need to bring together the working class, the middle strata, and unorganized clerical workers and service sector workers and would need to stress democratic control over consumption and social provision.\n\nIt is truer now than then that the middle class can't afford health care, housing, education or child care.\n\nDecommodification of these basic needs would be supported by progressive taxes and a reduction of military spending.\n\nThe importance of mass mobilization and democratic legitimacy is mentioned and that, as Rosa Luxembourg argued, after a revolution there should be a rapid restoration of civil liberties.\n\nIt is recognized by the writers of the document that capitalist democracy is not entirely bourgeois but not entirely democratic.\n\nIn the section of class consciousness and civil society the concept of counter hegemony which was developed by Antonio Gramsci, the Italian communist, is mentioned and analyzed.\n\nThere is a need for organizing the workplace, the neighborhood, the church, the synagogue, the mosque, the PTA.\n\nThere is a need for organizing in civil society, for cultural, educational, ideological work.\n\nThe writers propose a socialist globalization to replace neoliberal globalization.\n\nThe transition to socialism is likely to happen not at once but during a whole historical period, an era where there is a gradual displacement of capitalism and through worker buy outs, democratic control over pension funds and mandated worker and consumer representation on corporate boards.\n\nAs I wrote at the beginning much of it is relevant and thought provoking but it is up to us in the year 2013 to determine how the document can inform our actions and worldview.","order":5},{"title":"Thoughts About Building the Next Left: DSA's National Strategy Document from 1998","date":"2013-10-31","issue":"November 2013","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"Over the next few years, DSA's national office and the members of our National Political Committee (NPC) would like members of the organization to study, debate and amend our organizational strategy, which was last significantly altered in 1998.\n\nThe need for such a rethinking of DSA strategy seem obvious, although the task of bringing our strategic and organizational ideas up to date with current realities is obviously a challenging one.\n\nThis article deals mainly with two documents considered for updating: [*\"Building the Next Left: The Political Perspective of the Democratic Socialists of America,\"*](http://http:/www.dsausa.org/socialist_strategy#144) and [*\"Toward Freedom: Democratic Socialist Theory and Practice.\"*](http://http:/www.dsausa.org/socialist_strategy#77)\n\n**A Few Minor Changes That Have Occurred to the World Since Bill Clinton Held Office Back in 1998**\n\n\n\n**A.

These include – just for starters — the launching of two major US wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan; the traumatic events of 9/11/01 and the \"war on terror\" that flowed from them; the further flowering of the U.S. national security state under Bush as well as Obama, the massive expansion of government spying on the American public and the people of the world by the NSA, and the well-publicized rise of Al Qaeda as the supposed face of radical Islamic jihad across much of Africa and Asia.\n\n**B. Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution in Latin America**\n\nSince the late 1990s the world has also witnessed the establishment of a \"Bolivarian\" revolution in South America championed by the late Cesar Chavez of Venezuela and kindred leftwing radicals in Bolivia and Ecuador.\n\n**C. \"Re-Orienting\" the Global Economy: China, Inc. and the Asian Tigers**\n\nThe global capitalist marketplace meanwhile has been partly transformed\nby the continued economic expansion of China and its emergence as the\nsecond-largest economy in the world. The ongoing industrialization of India is promising to alter world market realities still further, as these two prominent Asian economies – accompanied to some degree by the smaller \"Asian Tiger\" economies of East and South Asia — shake off the memory of western imperial domination and resume what some historians believe was their status before 1750 – as the world's leading export economies.\n\n**D. The Bush Revolution on the Supreme Court, and the Election of Obama**\n\nJust within the borders of the United States, meanwhile, politics since the 1990s have been radically changed by the appointment of two new conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court by George W. Bush, by the court's subsequent overturning of legal restrictions on corporate political advocacy coupled with its recent weakening of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and by the election of the nation's first non-white president — Barack Obama – along with a white backlash that has followed.\n\nE. **The Real Estate Speculation Bubble and the Onset of Global Economic Crisis**\n\nOver this same fairly brief span of time, both the U.S. and other western capitalist societies have been wracked by the puncturing of a huge global real estate investment bubble and collapse or near-collapse of major financial institutions – a shocking and potentially catastrophic economic event in 2007 and 2008 that then gave rise to a massive growth in government indebtedness, both in the US and in many leading market economies of Europe.\n\n**F. Government Debts and Financial Crisis in the Eurozone**\n\nAs they have scrambled to take on corporate debt to prevent the further destabilizing of national economies, therefore, western governments in such places as Greece, Ireland, Iceland, and Spain have essentially collapsed or been replaced by the European authorities as the price of having their loan payment deadlines delayed by the bankers.\n\nMany European nations and the U.S., to a lesser extent, have fallen into economic recession as this process has taken place.\n\n**G. The LGBT Revolution and Its Discontents, and the Immigration Question.**\n\nMeanwhile the US and several other western countries have experienced a cultural and legal revolution as the gay rights movement has increasingly won victories in the legal arena, even to the extent of advancing gay marriage in some states of the Union. The victories of the gay rights movement arguably have helped to feed the emergence of a homophobic and politically conservative religious right, although some observers think this anti-gay backlash is now diminishing a bit.\n\nThe US and most of the capitalist societies of Europe have meanwhile experienced a huge increase in immigration, both legal and undocumented, as well as the emergence of angry nativist movements aimed at combatting further immigration. The building of a huge anti-immigration wall along the Texas/ Mexican border and the recent acceleration of deportations of undocumented workers under the auspices of the Obama White House are partial testaments to the vehemence of that backlash.\n\nFeeding both undocumented and document legal immigration to the US, meanwhile, has been an awkwardside effect of NAFTA and other \"free trade\" treaties adopted with bipartisan support in the 1990s. As poor peasants in Mexico and Central America, in particular, have been displaced through the invasion of their national economies by large transnational corporations given new access to Latin markets by NAFTA and the World Trade Organization (WTO), millions have been forced northward to look for work in the agricultural fields, meatpacking plants and many other industrial enterprises of the United States, putting the immigration controversy on the front pages.\n\n**H. Electronic Media and the Arab Spring Revolutions**\n\nThe spread of \"social\" electronic media – Facebook, Twitter and the World Wide Web, plus the seemingly relentless ownership of cell phones – has significantly transformed common forms of human communication over this same period. Arguably the latest developments in electronic media, especially Twitter and Facebook, helped to foster the Arab Spring revolutions of a few years ago and the overthrow of repressive and dictatorial governments in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, among other places.\n\n**I. The Politics and Economics of Climate Catastrophe**\n\nFinally, as all of these social and political transformations, and others besides, have been changing the face of the United States and the world, the continued inability or unwillingness of most governments and large corporations to curb industrial emissions of CO2 and other \"greenhouse\" gases has pushed the planet further along the road to catastrophic climate change.\n\nThe latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released last month, makes this clear. Many environmentalists and climate activists would point to last summer's catastrophic floods in Colorado and equally disastrous wildfires in California as evidence that the IPCC's conclusions are correct, and that they bode ill for human beings in many climate-sensitive parts of the world.\n\n\n\n**So What Needs to Change in DSA's Strategic Vision?**\n\nUnder these radically changing circumstances, how adequate is DSA's basic strategy document that members debated and finally endorsed in the late 1990s?\n\nAfter briefly reviewing two 1998 strategy documents, \"Building the Next Left: The Political Perspective of the Democratic Socialists of America,\" and \"Toward Freedom: Democratic Socialist Theory and Practice,\" as part of a project by members of the Metro DC Dsa Steering Committee, I would argue that many key passages in these document are surprisingly contemporary in tone. However, many the more catastrophic events of the past 15 years have discouraged many DSA chapters from following them.\n\nI think other findings of these documents either are less accurate than DSA members thought in the late 1990s, or that most DSA members have simply forgotten about them because they seemed too difficult to put into practice, leaving our organization in the embarrassing pickle of failing to practice what we preach.\n\nI would also suggest that DSA's relatively loose administrative structure and the freedom of individuals and chapters to depart at will from the national organization's stated principles have made the more impressive and most controversial aspects of \"Building the Next Left,\" especially, much less important in practice than they undoubtedly seemed to many DSA activists at the time.\n\n**Even European Social Democracy Was \"Obsolete,\" DSA Activists Argued in 1998: Do Most DSA Members Today Still Agree?**\n\nOne bold statement in \"Building the Next Left\" that some DSA members strongly agree with, for example, is that thanks in part to \"the unbridled power of transnational corporations ... Traditional left prescriptions \\[for political and economic change\\] have failed on both sides of the Communist / socialist divide.\"\n\nOr as the authors of \"Building the Next Left\" put it, \"Global economic integration has rendered obsolete both the social democratic solution of independent national economies sustaining a strong social welfare state and the Communist solution of state-owned national economies fostering social development.\"\n\nWithin the Metro DC chapter and around DSA, however, it is clear that many members still have considerable hope in the \"social democratic solution of independent national economies sustaining a strong social welfare state.\" We may have to admit that this solution seems to be failing miserably in Spain, for example, even when Spain is formally led by democratic socialist politicians, but many of us are not willing to concede that this \"social democratic\" answer has failed in – say, Germany or Scandinavia.\n\nHow do democratic socialists feel – and how should we feel – about using Scandinavian social democracy as our model for progressive politics in the U.S.? This is an issue that current DSA members need to debate and rethink, I would argue.\n\n**How Much Did DSA in the 1990s Still Believe in the Democrats? How Do Most DSAers Feel About This Today?**\n\nA second major theme of the 1998 strategy documents that leaps out – to me, anyway – is the decreased faith that the authors of \"Building the Next Left\" felt about working for change within the theoretical limits of New Deal liberalism or the political confines of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"Today,\" the 1998 document states, \"the mildly redistributive welfare state liberalism of the 1960s, which accepted the corporate dominance of economic decision-making, can no longer be the programmatic basis for a majoritarian progressive politics.\n\n\"New Deal and Great Society liberalism depended upon redistribution at the margins of an ever-expanding economic pie. But today corporations no longer aspire to expand production and consumption by raising global living standard; rather, global capital engages in a race to increase profits by \"downsizing' and lowering wages.\"\n\nRather than calling for the reassembling of a Democratic majority politics characterized by \"strong trade unions, social movements and urban, Democratic political machines,\" the 1998 document argues, \"a next left must be built from the bottom up.\"\n\nHas DSA since 1998 found any strategic success in rebuilding the left \"from the bottom up,\" I wonder?\n\nHow many newer members have joined DSA over the last two years mostly because they are still committed to the New Deal liberalism of the 1930s and the \"mildly redistributive\" politics of the 1960s Great Society (along with the expansion of civil rights for African Americans, women and gay people that has occurred since the 1960s), and hope that somehow, DSA can basically goad the Obama administration and the national Democratic Party to pursue a basically liberal and basically traditional agenda?\n\nHow many older DSA members still harbor hopes for the Democrats, if only out of horror at the damage that the victorious Republicans accomplished following George Bush's dubious victory over Al Gore in 2001, and the onset of Republican war-mongering, Republican tax cuts for the wealthy and Republican attempts to privatize Social Security after 2001?\n\nHow many current DSA members still agree with the authors of the 1998 \"Rebuilding the Left\" document that democratic socialists can work either for third parties or for reform within the Democratic Party? For that matter, how many current DSA members, especially younger ones influenced by the Occupy movement, have given up hoping for reform through electoral politics at all?\n\n**A Road Not Taken: Global Solidarity to Combat the Might of Global Corporations**\n\nA striking theme of the 1998 strategy document is that thanks to the growth of transnational corporations, purely national approaches to social and economic progress are obsolete, that \"today's social movements must be as global as the corporate power they confront; they must cooperate across national boundaries and promote democratic regulation of transnational capital.\"\n\nHistorically, the U.S. left seemed to be taking a major step in that direction with the 1999 \"Battle of Seattle\" protests and civil disobedience against the G-20 summit. Huge demonstrations here in Washington DC against the annual meeting of the IMF soon followed.\n\nBut in the wake of the World Trade Center bombings of Sept. 11, 2001 and the \"war on terror\" that followed, the international movement against corporate globalism seems to have faltered; at least, participation in it has become riskier for anti-corporate demonstrators, and the tactics employed by the Black Bloc anarchists at some of the latest anti-globalization protests have been controversial with liberals and probably with some democratic socialists.\n\nHow do most DSA activists feel today about international anti-global solidarity? Equally to the point, how much has DSA, either nationally or at the level of individual chapters, actually engaged in global solidarity work? If we chose to start acting on this principle from the 1998 strategy document, how should we do so?\n\n**Is a Global \"Leveling\" Up of Living Standards — And Also Resource Use — Still Feasible?**\n\nDSA in 1998 , in condemning the overseas outsourcing strategies of major corporationsand the decreased U.S. living standardsthat resulted from them,called for socialists to fight for a \"leveling up\" of wages and livingstandards around the world. Fighting for rising standards for all was seen as the left's only moral alternative totheglobal \"leveling down\"that the corporations were pursuing at the expense of American workers.\n\nThe political and moral logic of \"leveling up\"seems intuitively impeccable at first glance. But in a worldof limited natural resources where the richestcapitalist societiescontribute disproportionately to problems like global climate change,most environmentalists agree that it would be catastrophic if all of the world's peoples somehow, through whatever miracle, achieved the same levels of resource use and engaged insame kinds of consumerism that now characterize American society as a whole.\n\nObviously income distribution withinany given capitalist society is important, and there are extremely poor people here in the US who still need to see their living standards and their wages improve. There are even moredesperately poor people in manyformerly colonized societies who need sharply increased living standards to achieve even minimal levels of human decency, and socialists need to fight for this.\n\nButon a finite, if resource-rich,planet with finite reserves of non-renewable fossil fuels and metallic ores, and with finitely bounded natural systemsthat areessentialto human civilization (examples include ocean fisheries, tropical and temperate forests, and productive soils that supply humanity with food), most environmental analysts argue that it issimplyimpossible for all 7 billion people on Earth to enjoy the same levels of resource use that the average American now enjoys.\n\nIf everyone onEarth could be \"leveled up\" to current U.S. levels of consumerism, the scientists warn, a single Planet Earth would be insufficient to support all of us; indeed, we would need to exploittwo orthree Earth-like planets to sustain theglobal population at current U.S. levels.\n\nHow should democratic socialists, both in the Metro DC area and nationwide, grapple with this dilemma imposed by the physical constraints of resource availability, while still supporting socialist and egalitarian values?\n\n**On \"Economic Democracy\" and the Solidarity Economy**\n\nFor many of us familiar with the writings of the old Left, with the economic ideas of Marx, Lenin and even many of the European democratic socialists, a striking feature of the 1998 \"Rebuilding the Left\" document is its focus on \"economic democracy\" – on the idea of building the next left partly by supporting the idea of a mixed market and government economy coupled with the development of a strong sector of worker-owned businesses and cooperatives that could conceivably struggle to compete in such an economy and – over time – provide an alternative to large-scale corporate businesses that employ alienated labor.\n\nA Metro DC \"Socialist Salon\" on David Schweickart's notions of how such a system of \"Economic Democracy\" might be built provoked some sharp arguments within our chapter early in 2013, and it seems clear that some DSA members feel it would be a betrayal of \"real socialism,\" although other members support it.\n\nHow far should DSA go in promoting \"Economic Democracy\" in the future, and how should it be integrated – if it is integrated at all – into our other work for incremental economic reform on behalf of the unemployed, low-wage retail workers, labor organizing rights, and government spending on the poor and dispossessed under capitalism?\n\nAlso, what sense should DSA make – if any – of Chavez's Bolivarian revolution, or the street fighting that has occurred in Spain and Greece against austerity policies dictated by stronger European economies and the financial industry?\n\nHow should democratic socialists incorporate into our thinking the perils and the political possibilities raised by the near collapse of the capitalist global banking system in 2007 and 2008, accompanied by what left economist David McNally says was a $20 trillion loss in paper economic value?\n\nThese are some of many questions that I argue for all DSAers, or at any rate, for the most committed among us, to be keeping in mind as we review DSA's old strategy documents and engage in the long process of revising them. I hope that the *Washington Socialist*'s coverage of the strategy reassessment project will help people in the chapter to begin on that difficult but important task.","order":6},{"title":"Virginia Progressives: \"You Need A Raise!\"","date":"2013-10-31","issue":"November 2013","author":"Daniel Adkins","body":"The Democratic Party Committees of Fairfax and Arlington County recently organized two meetings that two or three hundred peoplehave attended.\n\nThe first, held by the Arlington County Democratic Committee, was on the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which meets secretly in areas of controlled access.

For those in prison, this contrasts with the Christmas season, a difficult time for many whether they celebrate the holiday or not. After all, it is a season of family togetherness and celebration, something difficult or impossible to fully embrace when locked up. January 1, on the other hand, is a happier occasion. No matter how long the sentence (except for those subjected to life terms), it marks a step in the journey home – \"one year done, one less to do\" is how the day is commonly seen. But the future, bright in the distance, can be a challenging time the nearer that final night behind the fence arrives. Release along with high expectations, hope and happiness, can bring its own tests – former prisoners must make their way with few resources when they re-enter what is often a vastly changed world. Without a strong network of family and friends (family and friends who themselves are able to provide help) it is an almost impossible challenge. Halfway houses exist to bridge that gap, to help prisoners with employment, housing, medical and other needs as they cross the line between incarceration and freedom. At least they exist for that purpose in theory; in practice they generally fall far short. Washington DC's Hope Village, located in Southeast DC, provides a telling example of just how far short they can fall.\n\nLast year, the District of Columbia Corrections Information Council (CIC) — established by the Revitalization Act of 1997 and the Jail Improvement Act of 2003 — confirmed what those who experienced Hope Village already knew. In a report based on an inspection of conditions at the facility as well as extensive interviews with residents, former resident, family members and staff, one sentence stands out:\n\nThe CIC heard on multiple occasions that incarcerated DC residents would prefer to stay at secure Bureau facilities than renter DC through Hope Village.\n\nTranslated into English, that means people would rather be in prison than stay in a halfway house that allows them to walk on city streets, visit home, eat \"real\" food, and have a degree of freedom not possible when locked up. That feeling is widespread and has nothing to do with nostalgia for prison, everything to do with how Hope Village functions. Findings included in the report may help explain why so many feel that way:\n\nDC residents are returning to the DC community after periods of incarceration, and many have served long sentences and are disconnected from their homes, families, loved ones, government, and local services. Often DC residents in Bureau custody are incarcerated in states all over the country, as far as California, Texas, Arizona, and Florida. Upon return to the DC community, residents need assistance with employment, housing, medical and mental healthcare, substance abuse, reintegration, mentoring, therapy, identification, transportation, living necessities, and more. All of these needs, if unmet, present significant challenges to reentry.\"\n\nDetailing what that meant, the report provides documentation that supports the following observations:\n\n-   Some programs are offered at Hope Village; however, the quality of the programming is poor. Topics discussed in class are not related to the class (e.g. in Life Skills class, life skills are not discussed and residents do not learn anything; in drug programming many topics are discussed, none of which include drugs or drug use). The time spent and subjects discussed in programming do not further the goal of successful reentry.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Residents feel unprepared to complete basic life tasks, such as taking the Metro or bus and navigating their way around the District, along with more complex tasks such as housing, employment and reentering a community they have been distanced from for an extended period of time.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   The vocational staff is not trained and lacks experience in employment assistance.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   The attitude of Hope Village staff is poor, providing punitive rather than supportive measures.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Staff members lack training and competence to work with the ex-offender population.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Staff does not offer enough support to residents at such a critical time in their lives to procure the most successful employment and life outcomes.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Hope Village provides little or no assistance for residents seeking housing upon their release from the facility. Residents are often forced to reside in homeless shelters or on the street when they fail to receive such assistance.\n\n\n\nTo put a human face on this, I saw last autumn someone I knew in prisonwalking the streets at Gallery Place, living in a homeless shelter after 20 years of prison for street drug crimes that left him locked up while in his 20s and 30s. Still a young man, he has no job skills, poor reading skills and few prospects. Returning to a changed city, his family now lives in PG County, the neighborhood where he grew up no longer affordable. Though nearby, it is another jurisdiction and he would have to jump through bureaucratic hoops to get approval to live there – and themselves stretched financially there was little concrete help they could give. Lacking a car, Metro being expensive, he could see them only rarely. Desperate for help, there was nothing real offered by way of assistance before leaving prison, in the halfway house, or now when back on the street.\n\nAnother man I knew, older, who had held jobs and is better able to navigate through life, I saw working ripping out walls and pipes in a building about to be renovated. It was a temporary job that a friend helped him find, one he was happy to do, but offering nothing long-term or permanent. Living with family members, he had a roof over his head and was happy to be again a free man. But he wanted a permanent job. While at Hope Village he was consistently asking for help –knowing that it is hard for a semi-skilled laborer, 50 years old, with a history of convictions, to land work. The \"booming\" economy in DC is not for the likes of people such as he.\n\nA third person faced a different reality. His younger brother is mentally disabled, his mother suffers diabetes; he didn't want to come home to be a burden. In his 30s, very determined and upbeat in life, he managed to get a part-time retail job earning minimum wage. He was happy with the work, but it certainly didn't allow him to rent an apartment. He too was caught in the gentrification change, his family no longer living in the District. So he was living in a shelter, trying to maintain a positive outlook that enables him to see beyond day-to-day. He had tried to get housing assistance while at Hope Village, the only help he received were empty words. So today, he also works at trying to maintain a positive outlook that goes beyond his bleak day-to-day.\n\nOthers, of course, are doing better. But generally in those cases they had family and friendship networks with sufficient resources to help them get a decent-paying full time job, to put a roof over their head, and to re-enter life truly free rather than as a supplicant. For them, Hope Village wasn't a help, it simply was less of a hindrance. And even then, other costs abound – for myself, it meant a delay in getting work, a delay in being with family, a delay in restarting life – contrary to expectations and contrary to what official policy is supposed to be. For those who are in Hope Village today, or who will be there in the future, a different kind of re-entry program is needed. As the CIC report explains, the District government ought to increase funding for employment and housing needs, mental and physical health provision, transportation, supporting family and community reintegration because, as the report says,\n\n... Increased provision of these support services will lead to DC residents spending less time incarcerated, overall safer communities, and monetary savings.\n\nBut those changes won't happen without pressure, without public concern and demand. At the end of last year, the Community Lawyering Project at Bread for the City, together with other organizations concerned about the rights and well being of people returning home after prison, called for a congressional hearing and town hall meetings to discuss the CIC Report and the beginning of a broad public discussion of how to implement its recommendations. Now, as we enter election season, these concerns need to be voiced loudly and insistently in the interests of justice and equity. For the essence of labor and socialist principles can be simply stated: all of us or none.\n\n\n\nAll quotes are from:\n\n[*District of Columbia Corrections Information Council (CIC) comprehensive report on conditions at the Hope Village Residential Reentry Center*](https://sites.google.com/a/dc.gov/cic/announcements/cichopevillagereportmay2013), May 14, 2013, Michelle R.

Joslyn Williams, president of the AFL-CIO Metropolitan Washington Labor Council, opened a Wednesday, January 15 celebration of the minimum wage hike victories in DC, Prince Georges and Montgomery counties, by changing the phrase, leading a chant \"Yes, we did.\" Good spirits were everywhere in evidence during the reception and the subsequent speech-making in the lobby of the AFL-CIO building as victories for working people – especially those which translate into real and immediate gains for many who are in need – are rare enough. But not too rare was the hope of the crowd; cheers rang out with calls for support to press the campaign to extend the increase to the entire state of Maryland, to bring the campaign to Virginia.\n\nHopes for further wins are not idle. The success just gained points the way for other campaigns as it entailed turning a defeat into victory, turning a geographically limited initiative into a broader regional movement. The story of the initial setback should be well-known. Last year, an apparently victorious campaign to increase the minimum wage at big-box stores –specifically Walmart – was defeated when the Washington, DC government was confronted by the power of fear. Walmart, ignoring the reality that its business model is based on low-wage labor, objected to the plan on the basis that it shouldn't be singled out for special, \"unfair\" treatment. Leaving aside the peculiar understanding of what constitutes \"fair play\" for a billio- dollar corporation that uses its market strength to undermine pay standards, some local political and business leaders were willing to buy the argument. Most were not, and thus, added to argument was the use of raw power. Wielding as a club the high rate of unemployment among District residents who are not benefitting from local gentrification, Walmart threatened to stop its planned opening of new outlets in the city if the proposal became law. Mayor Vincent Gray surrendered to that pressure, vetoed the bill, as did enough Council members such that the veto could not be overridden. But that was not the end of the story.\n\nDC City Council Chair Phil Mendelson explained to the gathering what happened next. Rather than accept corporate blackmail as a final answer, the Council took Walmart at its word and decided that the company would not be \"singled out.\" Instead of legislation limited to big box stores, Mendelson proposed a measure for an across-the-board minimum wage hike. Now Walmart would simply have to pay the same increased minimum as all retail and other low-wage employers. And this time the Council approved the measure with a veto-proof unanimous vote.\n\nThat unanimity was strengthened by the fact that suburban Maryland acted in concert with DC. Marc Elrich, Montgomery County Council Member at Large, explained how that happened. When he initially introduced local minimum wage hike legislation, the business community responded by claiming it was unfair to them for an increase to take place only in Montgomery County, implying that businesses might move out (the concept of \"fair,\" evidently not including workers interests). Elrich responded to that threat by reaching out to Mendelson and to other legislators in DC and Prince Georges, with the proposal that they introduce matching bills. By establishing the same increase in all three jurisdictional lines, employers could not so easily threaten to cross a street in order to higher lower-paid labor. Again, it was the ability to broaden the scope of the legislation that enabled progress to be made against corporate strategy to divide workers against each other. Expanding the range of progressive change, the blackmail failed — Walmart did not stop its expansion plans, nor did it or any other business move in consequence.\n\nImportant and vital as was legislative action, even more critical to the success won was pressure from the streets – it is hard to imagine the current momentum toward a minimum wage increase without the recent demonstrations, one-day strikes and rallies by Walmart and fast food workers across the nation. Williams in his opening comments emphasized the importance of mass pressure through coalition efforts as being responsible for the victories being celebrated. As he called out the names of coalition partners active in this victory, the applause and cheers given to each – Respect DC, DC Employment Justice Center, Jews United For Justice, Faith Strategies, DC Fiscal Policy Institute, DC Jobs with Justice, Casa De Maryland, Restaurant Opportunities Centers-DC, Progressive Maryland & PG NAACP – was a sign that the unity established with the Metro DC Labor Council can have lasting meaning in overcoming parochial divides which in the past divided workers living in different parts of the region.\n\nElizabeth Shuler, National AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, underscored the potential of that unity when she told the gathering that the successful campaign for a regional minimum wage was going to be used as a model for similar initiatives throughout the country. And, she added that unity of action built in the Metro DC area will be replicated in other regions through a new national community-labor-coalition – its formation first announced at his celebration.\n\nMeanwhile, plans are underway to maintain this unity and build upon this victory in our area. As noted above, approval was shouted out for calls to bring the campaign for a minimum wage increase to Annapolis so that suburban Maryland's gains can be spread throughout the state – and to take the fight to Richmond and win a similar raise for Virginia's low-paid workers. And not to be forgotten is the campaign to raise the pay for tipped workers who can still, legally, be paid as little as $2.13 per hour.\n\nBeyond that we need fair wages and jobs for all, a need Elrich stressed in his comments. So too did National AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Tefere Gebre, an immigrant from Ethiopia, who spoke of the meaning of the American Dream as a struggle for social justice for all. It is that struggle which calls to all of us to turn Si se Puede into a continuing triumphs for working people so that many more \"yes we did\" victories can be celebrated.\n\n[*Review of Social Democratic America by Lane Kenworthy*](http://dsadc.org/review-of-social-democratic-america-by-lane-kenworthy/)\n\nFriday, January 31st, 2014\n\nBy Jose Gutierrez\n\nIn*Social Democratic America*, Lane Kenworthy outlines an ambitious program, more ambitious in scope than that of almost any progressive politician.\n\nKenworthy suggests that the amount that the US spends on social insurance programs should increase by 10% of GDP, which would be equal to $1.5 trillion. He believes that through a kind of policy drift all of the rich countries have expanded their social insurance systems and that this dynamic is also taking place in the United States.\n\nKenworthymentions as evidence for his argument the creation and expansion of several programs since the 1970's including:\n\n\\* Expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit in 1986, 1990, 1993 and 2009.\n\n\\* Medicaid expansions in 1984-1988, 1998 and most recently in 2010.\n\n\\* Medicare prescription drug bill, 2004.\n\n\\* Creation and expansion of Child Tax Credit, 1997 and 2003.\n\n\\* Expansion of Head Start 1984, 1990, 1995, 2009.\n\n\\* Increase in disability benefits and expansion of access\n\n\\* Low-Income energy assistance, created in 1981\n\n\\* Public funding of after school activities in schools in low-income communities.\n\n\n\nThe major exception to his argument, which he mentions in his book, is Aid to Families with Dependent Children.\n\nHe believes that once a program is created it is difficult to eliminate that program.\n\nKenworthy suggests that reforms will come piecemeal and not all at once. His comprehensive list of reforms include:\n\n-   Universal health insurance\n\n-   Universal system of one year of paid parental leave\n\n-   Universal early education\n\n-   Increased Child Tax Credit\n\n-   Universal sickness insurance\n\n-   Eased eligibility criteria for unemployment insurance\n\n-   Wage insurance for unexpected drops in income\n\n-   State-run supplemental defined-contribution pension plans with automatic enrollment\n\n-   Extensive, personalized job search and (re)training support\n\n-   Government as employer of last resort\n\n-   Minimum wage increased modestly and indexed to inflation\n\n-   Earned Income Tax Credit extended farther up the income ladder and indexed to average wages or GDP per capita\n\n-   Higher benefit level for social assistance (i.e. TANF-like programs)\n\n-   Reduced incarceration of low-level drug offenders\n\n-   Affirmative action shifted to focus on family background rather than race\n\n-   Expanded government investment in infrastructure and public spaces\n\n-   More paid holidays and vacation time\n\n\n\nKenworthy mentions the idea of government as employer of last resort, which is the most popular of the five suggestions made by Jesse Myerson in his piece for[*Rolling Stone*](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/five-economic-reforms-millennials-should-be-fighting-for-20140103).\n\nThere is also some overlap between his proposal and the[*social and economic bill of rights*](http://www.dsausa.org/a_social_and_economic_bill_of_rights)proposed by[*Democratic Socialists of America*](http://www.dsausa.org/).\n\nHe proposes that this agenda be funded by the following revenue increases:\n\n-   Value Added Tax of 12% (5.0% of GDP)\n\n-   Return to 2000 federal income tax rates (2.0% of GDP)\n\n-   New tax brackets at the top of the income distribution (0.7%)\n\n-   Elimination of the mortgage interest tax deduction (0.6%)\n\n-   Carbon tax (0.7%)\n\n-   Financial transactions tax of 0.5% on trades (0.5%)\n\n-   Increase the payroll tax cap so that it covers 90% of earnings (0.2%)\n\n-   Increase the payroll tax by 1 percentage point (0.3%)\n\n\n\nKenworthy is pessimistic about the prospects of a revitalized labor movement. He also doesn't think it's necessary to achieve the goals outlined in his book.\n\nWhile it is not surprising that any progressive would feel that way, it is surprising that he thinks the goals he outlines are achievable without the support of a dynamic grassroots movement. A welfare state of the scope he describes has been achieved only in countries with powerful labor movements and strong socialists or social democratic parties.\n\nHe also doesn't think that major changes to the trade policy of the US are called for. He is not very optimistic about the US adopting a full-employment policy, which again, seems to contradict the fact that he is in favor of government being an employer of last resort.\n\nThere are some proposals in the book that would be difficult for many to embrace.\n\nHis proposal for a Value Added Tax, which is a type of consumption tax, would be one example, even though, as he points out, there is no country with a large social insurance system that doesn't have one.\n\nKenworthy also never discusses the need for worker control that would increase the likelihood that these reforms would not be reversed at a later time.\n\nStill, it is a worthwhile book. At the very least the agenda mentioned\nby the writer would constitute a consensus position of immediate reforms\nfor the American left.\n\nFor additional perspectives on the book and related topics:\n\n1.[*Interview with writer*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/01/09/this-sociologist-has-a-plan-to-make-america-more-like-sweden/)\n\n2.[*Liberal critique of book*](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/01/24/3199891/kenworthy-social-democracy/)\n\n3.[*Socialist critique*](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2013/08/social-democracy-for-our-time/)\n\n4.[*How a more developed Welfare State could lead to a more radical change in the United States*](https://inthesetimes.com/article/13998/the_welfare_state_of_america/)\n\n[*Women's Paid Unemployment Rate Falling*](http://dsadc.org/womens-paid-unemployment-rate-falling/)\n\nFriday, January 31st, 2014\n\nCarolyn M. Byerly\n\nWomen's paid employment is not only bouncing back from the 2007-08 financial crash, but is higher than at any time in US history, according to a December 6 report from the[*Institute for Women's Policy Research*](http://dsadc.org/2014/01/www.iwpr.org). The report said job growth for both women and men is in major recovery mode. The[*IWPR report*](http://tiny.cc/NovemberJobs)was based on an analysis of U.S. Bureau Labor Statistics from November 2013.\n\nThe government stats showed women gained the most jobs in education and health services (39,000), professional and business services (17,000), and retail trade (15,600). Even though women's unemployment figures of 6.7 percent are lower than men's 7.3, men still hold more paid jobs than women overall, the IWPR report said. Even more important, when the women's figures are disaggregated, single mothers' unemployment rate is the highest of all at 9.7 percent.\n\nThese are important stats to consider, but they are incomplete, of course. The government's unemployment data don't include people who have been without jobs for long periods of time, the chronically unemployed. This means that the outlook for women could actually be even grimmer than the IWPR's analysis found. Moreover, in other recent research, the IWPR has found that the wage gap between men and women is not likely to close until 2058. In other words, women will not see equal pay during their working lives.\n\nThe IWPR, based in Washington, DC, was founded by Dr. Heidi Hartmann, a socialist feminist economist, in 1987.","order":0},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—February 2014 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"February 2014","order":-1,"date":"2014-02-11","body":"Welcome to the February edition of the*Washington Socialist*, the monthly newsletter of the DC Metro Democratic Socialists of America.

And among those most hurt by such action/inaction have been immigrants, millions of whom are forced to live in a shadow world because Congress has refused to pass just and comprehensive immigration reform legislation, as well as because of federal and local enforcement of unjust laws that deem categories of people living in the country as \"illegals.\" These laws are and should be seen as unjust like those segregation laws that defined African Americans as being second-class citizens.\n\nDifficulty in making progress nationally has therefore pushed the struggle to the states – and there progress has been made in Maryland. . Last year, state legislators passed the Dream Act, enabling children of immigrants – many who have spent virtually their whole life in the U.S. – to attend college. This important measure opened up opportunities, the chance for a future, for many whose hopes up til then had been denied. Nonetheless that step alone didn't fully legalize their status or the status of their family members; the danger of being subject to unfair and unjust treatment under the law, including the danger of deportation, remains. Thus the battle for immigrant rights in the state has taken a new direction. Prince George's County State Senator Victor Ramirez (D-47<sup>th</sup>) – with support from Casa de Maryland, SEIU, and the ACLU – is proposing the \"Maryland Trust Act,\" legislation that would prohibit local police from holding immigrants for transfer to federal immigration unless they have been charged or convicted of felonies.\n\nThis legislation is designed to establish community trust in law enforcement, trust impossible when something as simple as a traffic ticket can lead to someone's deportation, splitting families, taking livelihoods, creating fear. Such a measure is an assertion of state authority designed to *protect* civil liberties, and stands in direct opposition to state measures of voter suppression and civil rights abuses directed at African Americans in states like Alabama, North Carolina and Texas – states also at the forefront of targeting and harassing immigrants. Absent such laws, local police can be used by right-wing forces to disrupt community organizing, and can be and have been used by business interests to try and undermine union organizing drives. The past two decades have seen numerous instances of collusion between local police and immigration police to arrest and deport workers who are raising their voices in packinghouse and other industries.\n\nRamirez's bill is modeled on a similar measure signed into law last month in California and is based on research and policy proposals developed by the ACLU and presented in the report \"Restoring Trust: How Immigration Detainers in Maryland Undermine Public Safety Through Unnecessary Enforcement.\" According to a \"Maryland Juice\" post, key findings in the ACLU report include:\n\n-   Most individuals held on an immigration detainer in Maryland are charged only with traffic violations or minor misdemeanor offenses.\n\n-   The overwhelming majority of people targeted by immigration detainers in Maryland are Latino.\n\n-   Immigration detainers undermine public safety and community trust in local law enforcement by entangling local authorities in federal immigration enforcement.\n\n-   Immigration detainers are purely voluntary requests that impose costs on local jurisdictions, and those costs are not reimbursed by the federal government.\n\n-   Several states, counties, and cities across the United States have taken steps to stop detaining individuals based solely on immigration detainer requests.\n\nIf the bill is passed it will be a step toward equalization of rights between communities. Another such initiative is taking place now in the on-going labor/community legislative drive to increase the minimum wage in Prince George's and Montgomery Counties in Maryland and in Washington DC, in order to create a regional minimum wage of $11.50 per hour, indexed to inflation. The idea behind pushing the same bill in all three jurisdictions is to create a common front so that lower wages in one area are not used to push down wages in other areas. And indexing the gains to inflation means that today's progress won't be lost each time the local cost of living rises. Absent that, a full-time worker with two children has a standard of living at or below the poverty level, makingany path out of that poverty far more difficult.\n\nInitiatives such as these won't substitute for needed federal action, but they are important stepping stones toward that end. Victory, however, will not come easily — as seen in Washington DC where Walmart used its economic power to blackmail the city and force a rollback of proposed wage increases that had been easily passed by the City Council. And, as comments on Ramirez' legislation indicates, his bill will be fought by demagogic appeals to fear and hatred, by the effort to blame our country's economic distress on those without rights so that those with power are held unaccountable. Yet the progress made in Maryland last year is a sign that these victories can be won – and each such victory can provide a basis to further social and economic equality and thereby fight back against corporate power's attempts to render democratic rights meaningless.\n\nSources:\n\nImmigration Bill:\n\n\"Maryland bill would limit local immigration policing,\" AP, *Frederick News Post*, ([*http://www.fredericknewspost.com/content/tncms/live/2*](http://www.fredericknewspost.com/content/tncms/live/2)),\n\nNovember 19, 2013\n\n\n\n**\"ACLU Report Details How Immigration Detainers in Maryland Undermine Public Safety Through Unnecessary Enforcement,\"** ACLU Press Release, Juice \\#6, 11/22/13, *Maryland Juice: Advance Justice Through Information* (David Moon) (http://www.marylandjuice.com/2013/11/juice-kagan-vs-simmons-for-d17-senate.html\\#sthash.NvT2A7bU.dpuf)\n\nMinimum Wage Bill:\n\n\"ACT NOW: One Vote Needed to Pass Montgomery County Minimum Wage, Progressive Neighbors MD, Press Release, 11/23/13 ([*pn4change@gmail.com*](mailto:pn4change@gmail.com))\n\nResolution \\# 11 \"Minimum Wage, Maryland State and District of Columbia AFL-CIO, 10/26/13 ([*http://md.aflcio.org/mddcstatefed/index.cfm?action=cat&categoryID=23a00fdb-ef0b-4eba-9e4f-3355d6d977b2*](http://md.aflcio.org/mddcstatefed/index.cfm?action=cat&categoryID=23a00fdb-ef0b-4eba-9e4f-3355d6d977b2)\n\n[*Good Reads: Best articles for December*](http://dsadc.org/good-reads-best-articles-for-december/)\n\nSaturday, November 30th, 2013\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;*December 2013**\n\n***Some of the best articles (linkable, that is) we (and you) have run across since the last issue:***\n\nFran Piven and Fred Block review the interplay of inequality and the Clinton-legacy welfare programs (plus some that are even older) in an article from DISSENT.

(New York: Free Press, 2012)\n\n\n\nIn October 2008, Neil Barofsky was an aggressive young prosecutor working for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan on mortgage-related financial fraud. A lifelong Democrat, he was surprised when his Republican boss persuaded the Bush administration to hire him as Special Inspector General for the newly created Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), which then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson had hastily cobbled together to avert the overall collapse of a tottering U.S. financial system.\n\nIn *Bailout*, his memoir of attempting to provide anti-fraud oversight for TARP, Barofsky provides the reader with a lively anecdotal account of how TARP evolved and functioned, first under the outgoing Bush White House and then under Obama's team.\n\nIn telling the tale, Barofsky provides informative vignettes of – among many others— Neel Kashkari, the 35-year-old former Goldman Sachs vice president chosen to administer the new bailout program by Bush Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and Herb Allison, a courtly 65-year-old financial industry veteran who was tapped by Obama's new Treasury chief Tim Geithner to run TARP after Kashkari's departure. Fascinating glimpses of other well-known Washington personalities also are scattered through the book, giving us insights into political players like Barney Frank, Elizabeth Warren, conservative Republican senator Charles Grassley, Alabama's Sen. Richard Shelby, and many others.\n\nBeyond the trove of collected personality profiles that Barofsky furnishes in this memoir, however, is one big and uncomfortable truth: in Barofsky's estimation, TARP never worked well – or to be more accurate, it worked for some of the big banks, but it never delivered what its proponents and administrators had promised it would also deliver: relief for millions of heavily indebted homeowners whose mortgages were at risk of foreclosure in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nInstead, Barofsky writes, first the Bush Treasury Department and then the Obama team devised scheme after scheme to employ hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer funds to bail out the biggest US banks that had helped to create runaway speculation in mortgage-backed securities, and that profited heavily from the trend until it exploded. Both administrations also resisted Barofsky's proposals for anti-fraud controls on the TARP outlays, thus making it extremely difficult for him to do his job.\n\nIn response to his proposals, Barofsky reports of one tense meeting with the Bush team for TARP, \"Kashkari suggested that requiring banks to report on their use of funds could actually destroy ... TARP and perhaps, as a result, the entire banking system. He accused us of being politically motivated or just plain stupid.\"\n\nDespite Barofsky's hopes, Obama's new Treasury team, featuring Geithner and Allison, failed to bring much improvement over Kashkari and the Republicans. Under Democratic as well as under Republican auspices, the bailout program continued to shovel huge sums of money in the direction of the bankers, with minimal if any oversight from the Special Inspector General's office.\n\nWhen Geithner's Treasury Department, which by now was attempting to relabel the TARP program as the Financial Stability Plan, unveiled a huge new scheme for helping endangered mortage holders as well as the financial industry – a plan that Geithner called the Public Private Investment Program (PPIP) — Barofsky and his staff were stunned by the potential financial holes and loopholes in it.\n\n\"The fraud risks jumped out at us,\" he writes. \"Although it was going to be funded overwhelmingly with taxpayer dollars, PPIP had been designed by Wall Street, for Wall Street. We only later learned, in connection with one of our audits, that at the same time that Treasury had been keeping us in the dark, it had been working on the design of the program with ... two of the giant investment houses that would later manage funds under the program and stand to profit from it the most.\"\n\nYet – at least according to Barofsky's account – Geithner and other Treasury Department officials stoutly resisted his attempts as Special IG to prevent serious abuse of the program. As Barofsky fought back against his Treasury Department superiors by using his power as an auditor to issue a series of well-publicized reports outlining potential problems with the ongoing bailout efforts, he found himself being attacked in the *Wall Street Journal* by anonymous Treasury officials who accused him of trying to scare bankers away from the financial rescue package. Late in his career as Special Inspector General for TARP, he was attacked by name by a White House press official, an Obama appointee, for allegedly undermining the program.\n\nWhy was there such bipartisan pushback against efforts to provide financial oversight of TARP and its successor programs? Why did those administering the programs repeatedly sacrifice the interests of homeowners facing foreclosure while focusing obsessively on helping the banks, as Barofsky reports they did?\n\n*Bailout* offers an intriguing series of insights as to what may have motivated the Republicans and Democrats who administered TARP. To start with, Barofsky strongly suggests, the pressures of electoral politics in an off-year Congressional election year probably explained some of the hits that the TARP Special Inspector General's office took from the Obama team in 2010.\n\nThe added fact – much lamented by the political left at the time — that both the Bush administration and the Obama White House filled high-ranking economic policy positions in Washington with financial veterans of the same professional circles on Wall Street that had helped to create the near-financial collapse of 2008 in the first place was, in Barofsky's view, another key factor.\n\nSuch Treasury appointees as Paulson, Kashkari, Geithner and Allison all had the same or similar backgrounds as the banking officials they were overseeing, and Barofsky thinks they simply could not imagine that their old colleagues – who had previously driven the global financial system to the brink of the abyss – might somehow lack the integrity or the genius to save it.\n\nBut one far more basic and highly disquieting fact about TARP as Barosky portrays it is that the program was sold under false pretenses from the start. Hank Paulson, after previously denying that there was anything seriously wrong with the US financial sector, rolled out a proposed $700 billion TARP program in the fall of 2008 in hopes of preventing a total failure of the banks.\n\nPaulson promoted his original scheme as a way to relieve endangered homeowners as well as banks by using TARP's unprecedented budget to buy up \"toxic\" mortgages and remove them from the bankers' books, Barofsky notes. Some progressive Congressional Democrats reluctantly supported the plan for that reason. But by the time Congress finally approved the program, Paulson had already decided his original scheme would be too slow to provide the relief needed, and he therefore carved a $250 billion sub-program out of the original $700 plan to provide immediate infusions of cash to several of the biggest banks, without doing anything about their toxic mortgages.\n\nWhen Congress howled in protest, Paulson insisted that the banks getting the money were healthy, and that the new funds would help spur them into lending money and restarting economic growth. But Paulson himself later admitted to him, according to Barofsky, that at least two of the banks getting the CPP money were believed ready to collapse, and as it turned out, the banks getting relief were still too uncertain about the economy's health to lend out the funds they'd been given. Instead, they sat on them, for the sake of their own security, and the benefits to the economy were limited.\n\nCPP and in a larger sense TARP, in short, were designed by Paulson to inject huge amounts of government money into the financial sector to prevent immediate economic Armageddon, and the assurances given to Congress and the public about relief for homeowners were just window dressing for this fact. This suggests that Kashkari may have been completely sincere in saying that Barofsky's proposed anti-fraud safeguards for the bailout fund might have wrecked the entire financial sector. Treasury officials wanted to rescue the banks, period, without drawing anyone's attention to their perilously fragile condition, Barofsky concludes; and naturally, they hated the idea of the Special Inspector General's office drawing public attention to this.\n\nGeithner apparently didn't confide in Barofsky as Paulson allegedly did. But judging from *Bailout*'s narrative of the Geithner years, the Obama Treasury Department seems to have been motivated by the same fear of total collapse that apparently motivated Paulson and Kashkari.\n\nThe root problem, Barofsky argues late in this book, is that the US financial sector in 2008 really was dominated by a few giant banks and other financial institutions that were so entwined with one another and with other parts of the financial industry that they had become \"too big to fail,\" and both Bush Republicans and Obama Democrats deemed it urgently important to throw money at them to prevent that potential disaster – but without being candid with the voters or underwater homeowners that this was the government's aim.\n\nSince 2008 and the passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, as Barofsky and many other commentators have noted, the largest banks have gotten even larger and more central to the financial sector than they were at the time of the last financial collapse. What's more, the health of our capitalist U.S. economy depends in large part on private investors' – whether wealthy individuals or large institutions— having the confidence (what Keynes once termed the \"animal spirits\") to risk large sums on making new investments in production, distribution and exchange.\n\nHaving a financially fragile banking system – and what's worse, having smart and aggressive regulatory officials from the government, like Barofsky in his tenure – publicly commenting on the system's weakness is potentially fatal to investor confidence, as Barofsky comes close to admitting in this memoir.\n\nWhat this suggests to many socialists, anyway, is that until we devise a somewhat different economic system with somewhat different arrangements for insuring investment and re-investment in the real economy, we can probably count on bailouts of this ilk being repeated, and Treasury officials lying to the public as this occurs.","order":1},{"title":"Making It Possible NOT to Become an Immigrant","date":"2013-12-01","issue":"December 2013","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Review of *The Right to Stay Home: How US Policy Drives Mexican Migration* by David Bacon. Beacon Press, Boston, 2013.\n\nThe debate over U.S. immigration policy has largely become a question over what to do about immigrants already in the United States. Smooth their path to citizenship? Give them green cards and enroll them in guest-worker programs? Throw them out? Send them to prison?\n\nTo assume that large numbers of people from abroad will always clamor to enter the United States, legally or not, unfortunately casts the debate in terms favorable to the anti-immigrant right. Charismatic xenophobes such as Fox TV commentator Lou Dobbs and Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio eagerly raise the specter of foreign hordes at the gates – or inside the gates – aiming to steal our jobs and corrupt our culture while refusing to learn English. Even liberals and the left tend to focus on legalization and a path to citizenship, rather on the more fundamental question – why do so many people from Mexico and other countries come to the United States in the first place?\n\nLabor journalist and former union organizer David Bacon provides a necessary corrective to the notion of the inevitability of large-scale immigration with his new book *The Right to Stay Home: How US Policy Drives Mexican Migration*. The book could be viewed as Part II of Bacon's dissection of U.S. immigration policy, following 2008's *Illegal People: How Globalization Creates Migration and Criminalizes Immigrants. *\n\nIn his latest book, Bacon supplements his own reportage and analysis with narratives by migrants themselves, describing in their own words their experiences in the United States – why they left Mexico, their exploitation and mistreatment by their employers, and their attempts to fight back. Bacon relayed some of these stories in a talk last October at Democratic Socialists of America's national convention in Oakland, Calif.\n\nIn both of his books, Bacon shows why so many Mexicans and persons of other nationalities are desperately trying to enter the United States – not from the lure of living in \"the land of the free,\" but because globalization and U.S. corporate priorities are driving them here. And while Bacon largely examines migration of Mexicans, his analysis also could apply to many of the countries and regions that are the source of large numbers of migrants, especially Central America and Asia. Yet his focus on Mexico allows him to more sharply illustrate the impact of globalization on the country that is by far the source of the greatest number of migrants – both documented and not – to the United States.\n\nIn both books, Bacon skillfully connects the dots between neoliberal trade policy and the desperation that drives people from Mexico to the United States. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect in 1994, broke down trade barriers between the United States, Canada and Mexico. This allowed cheap, industrially produced U.S. agricultural products – notably corn – to flood the Mexican market, causing prices to plummet below the level that would allow Mexican farmers to make a profit. This drove countless Mexican farmers off the land to seek work elsewhere. Many migrated within Mexico, but many others crossed the border to the United States where certain kinds of jobs were plentiful – seasonal agricultural jobs or work in meat-processing factories lured many of them. Although many of these jobs were difficult and dangerous, and almost all of them paid below a living wage for a U.S. worker, the difference between the cost of living in the United States and Mexico made it possible for Mexican migrant workers to subsist while sending part of their pay back to their families south of the border. This suited the Mexican government, because the remittances – in excess of $20 billion annually — were a valuable source of income, and encouraged successive Mexican governments to collaborate with U.S. neoliberal trade policy.\n\nU.S. corporations welcomed the migrants because they were willing to work cheap – especially undocumented immigrants, who were trying to stay under the radar of U.S. immigration authorities and therefore tended to be reluctant to fight back against unjust treatment. And there has been plenty of that: Bacon documents rampant abuses faced by migrant workers, such as wage theft, barely habitable housing, exposure to toxic pesticides, sexual assaults on female workers and much more.\n\nBacon makes sense of the seeming contradiction of U.S. corporations eagerly exploiting desperate migrant workers while the U.S. government, in the form of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), hunts them down for deportation or even imprisonment. In fact, the companies and ICE work hand in glove: When migrant workers become too assertive in protesting brutal conditions or, especially, when they become so bold as to try to organize a union, the employer tips off ICE, which then rushes in with arrests and deportation orders – a practice that has accelerated during the Obama administration. The company then hires a new batch of undocumented workers and starts afresh.\n\nEven under such oppressive conditions, a surprisingly large number of migrants have attempted to speak up or fight back. In Los Angeles, Mexican migrant workers became leaders of International Longshore and Warehouse Union and United Electrical Workers locals. Sometimes workers fired for lack of documents take to the streets, as did large numbers of San Francisco janitors in 2010, although their protests failed to win them back their jobs. Bacon also illustrates the growth of solidarity between unions on both sides of the border with the growing recognition that U.S. and Mexican workers face a common struggle.\n\nSome employers, mostly bigger companies that hire large numbers of non-citizens, would prefer an expanded guest-worker program rather than rely on undocumented workers – in other words, a return to the *bracero* program that brought large numbers of Mexican workers to the United States from the 1940s to the 1960s. These workers, initially imported to compensate for worker shortages during World War II, came to be used regularly by companies to replace striking workers and break unions. The *bracero* program also was characterized by abusive treatment of the workers, and was not so different from today's program that provides a limited number of temporary visas for foreign workers who are recruited by specific companies. These companies seek a more \"managed\" form of immigration, one that provides them with a low-cost, docile workforce without the threat of ICE raids. Smaller employers, however, tend to prefer undocumented workers, who will work cheaper and be even less likely to speak up against unfair treatment.\n\nEmployers are supposedly subject to sanctions for knowingly hiring undocumented immigrants. But, as Bacon shows, companies are hardly ever penalized for the practice. ICE will frequently notify a company that many of their employees have Social Security numbers that do not match their names, a sign that the numbers may be fictitious or \"borrowed\" from real cardholders and therefore being used by undocumented immigrants. However, this only encourages the company to fire the suspect workers, and there are seldom further repercussions for the employer – but for the employee, the result is unemployment and possibly worse.\n\nBacon argues that the immigration debate must emphasize reducing the need for people to leave their communities in the first place. Organizations such as the Binational Front of Indigenous Organizations have led strikes and other protests, largely in the poorer regions of southern Mexico, demanding alleviation of the conditions that drive people out of their communities in order to survive.\n\n\"\"Without addressing the sources of the displacement that pushes people into the guest worker stream, recommendations for better management assume an inherent desire on the part of workers to come to the United States,\" Bacon writes.\n\nA major step in halting forced migration, Bacon asserts, would be to renegotiate NAFTA and other trade agreements that are the cause of displacement. Progressives should support policies that strengthen local economies in Mexico, making them more self-sufficient and less subject to the vicissitudes of the global economy.\n\nCanceling or reducing Mexico's foreign debt would go a long way to making unnecessary the remittances by Mexican workers in the United States. Remittances account for 2 percent of Mexico's GDP, but these are largely swallowed by the country's debt payments, which are 3 percent of GDP. Without the debt, the payments could be used for local development projects that in time would make the remittances unnecessary.\n\nAnother part of the solution must be better treatment of all migrants in the United States. One way to make guest-worker programs less oppressive, Bacon argues, would be to allow holders of work permits to seek employment anywhere they wish, rather than have their right to be in the United States tied to employment with a specific company. The current system is a form of indentured servitude in which the company can threaten employees not only with firing but almost-certain deportation if they become too assertive.\n\nA welcome challenge to the criminalization of migrants was the AFL-CIO's reversal of its stance on immigration. Once concerned about migrants as competitors for their members' jobs, in 1999 the federation \"called for the repeal of employee sanctions, legalization of the undocumented, and enforcing labor rights for all workers,\" Bacon writes. In addition, last year President Obama told ICE to stop deporting young people who were brought to the United States as children if they were attending or had graduated from school or served in the military – although he was unsuccessful in persuading Congress from passing the Dream Act, meaning that their ability to remain here is subject to the whim of whomever occupies the White House.\n\nMigrant activists and their allies amplified their demands by participating in the 2011 Occupy protests and by protesting the attacks the same year against Wisconsin public-sector workers. In communities such as Seattle, San Diego and Oakland, Calif., the Occupy movement's tactics were inspired by the Mexican tradition of the *planton*, an encampment in a public square designed to focus public attention on a particular demand or injustice. In Wisconsin, Bacon writes, the message of migrants and U.S. citizens alike was: \"We all work, we all contribute to our communities and we all have the right to a job, a union and a decent life.\"\n\nYet a sensible, just solution to the immigration crisis is contrary to corporate interests and those of their cronies in both the U.S. and Mexican governments. It will take a vocal, sophisticated movement on both sides of the border to force the \"right to stay home\" onto the agenda of policymakers. That movement is growing in Mexico, and it needs more allies north of the border. Yet David Bacon has done his part in providing that movement with facts, ideas and stories that will help it succeed.","order":2},{"title":"Palgrave Handbook of Women in Journalism examines gender in the neoliberal newsroom","date":"2013-12-01","issue":"December 2013","author":"Carolyn M. Byerly","body":"First, the back story.\n\nIt's a fact that more and more of the world's people are getting their news online these days, but the traditional news media – increasingly called the \"legacy media\" – remain the main employers of both print and electronic journalists. Add to this another fact: Those media still actively discriminate against their women employees the world over.\n\nBut how bad is it, and how does it differ from nation to nation?\n\nIn 2008, I was asked by the International Women's Media Foundation to oversee a global study of women's employment in the traditional news companies to answer these questions. The project would take over my academic life for several years, culminate in more statistical data than anyone would ever use, and produce two publications – a technical report and an academic text. This was not done singlehandedly – I had a small budget that was used to secure and pay a team of 160 researchers in 59 nations (whom I would also supervise – that was fun). The project would encompass interviews with executives at 522 companies (newspapers, TV & radio stations). The media we surveyed published or broadcast in nearly 40 different languages; however, completed questionnaires were submitted to me in English, Spanish and French. After months of data entry and fussing with numbers (hooray for statisticians), I wrote (and IWMF published) the 400-page technical report in 2011(See *Global Report on the Status of Women in News Media*, downloadable free at [*www.iwmf.org*](http://www.iwmf.org)).\n\nWhat the study found will be summarized shortly.\n\nBut now the current story:\n\nIn late October, the second publication, *The Palgrave International Handbook of Women and Journalism*, came into print. It included 29 of the original 59 nations, with most chapters written by the original researchers for those nations. (See details on the book at http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=634271)\n\nDid I mention looking for a publisher? It turns out that book publishing has gone through the same conglomeration process as other media (all over the world), and few academic publishers in the social sciences want to publish real research (which now goes almost exclusively to journals). Publishers have shifted to textbooks, mostly, which are more lucrative. The UK-based Palgrave Macmillan Company is one of few that still recognizes the value of original work and its editors were excited about the project from the outset.\n\nWhat distinguishes the *Palgrave Handbook* from its predecessor *Global Report* is that the findings for each of the 29 nations are discussed in greater detail, within a context of history, politics, media-government relations, culture and women's status. I authored four chapters, including one on feminist political economy of news that makes an effort at situating women in the neoliberalized (is that a word?) news industry. The book is arguably the biggest effort to date to determine where women fit into the newsmaking apparatus of companies across the world. While not comprehensive (we did not even set out to gather data on all companies), it is representative – and revealing.\n\nWhen aggregated, the data from those original 59 nations show women beginning to do quite well within the profession at the reporting ranks, and, in some nations, even in the lower rungs of newsroom management. But in nearly ALL nations, there is a clear glass ceiling, with men dominating in top management and governance roles of traditional media companies. Women are also marginalized in technical jobs, e.g., camera work and production.\n\nThere are some surprises. Women journalists seem to fare best in the former communist nations of Eastern Europe, where the goal was to educate women for the workforce. Women are near parity with men and in some nations (e.g., Russia) even surpass them in number. Why? Journalism became feminized during the Soviet-era news industry, which was both heavily oriented to state propaganda and also low paid. After the Berlin Wall came down, and those nations moved toward democracy, women were already in place in those newsrooms and have retained their jobs. Authors of these nations, however, are quick to point out that sexism still abounds in the news and other employment sectors and across the broader society.\n\nWomen journalists also fare well in the Nordic nations, where the Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish authors noted \"gender equality is a public consensus\" and laws for several decades provide the framework for women's advancement professionally. It also helps that these nations have extremely generous maternity and paternity benefits, as well as community based public daycare centers.\n\nBy contrast, in Japan, men outnumber women 7:1 in news companies. In Bangladesh, India and Jordan, the ratio is 5:1, and in Lebanon, 2:1. Here in the USA, women are inching toward parity with men in reporting roles and even in middle management (e.g., senior editors), but not so in the higher roles of decision making. The glass-ceiling is firmly in place even in this nation which has experienced a more vigorous era of feminism than many others.\n\nLeftists are likely to dismiss traditional news media as sources of the truth; however, there is no way to dismiss those them as workplaces. Newsrooms have greatly (also gravely) been affected by major structural shifts these last two decades, the most obvious two being digital convergence and a rapid process of conglomeration. Often overlooked are the gendered dimensions of these events, and so it is significant that the majority of the authors in the *Palgrave Handbook* talked about media conglomeration and its impact on women journalists in their countries (both developed and developing). Some examples are layoffs, the switch from full to part-time (or freelance) positions, and a level of emotional tension on the job produced by uncertainty. Women feel these pinches disproportionately within this occupation, as they do in others, and it falls to leftist feminist researchers to examine these lest they be ignored.","order":3},{"title":"Virginia Elections 2013: Dems slip by amid GOP civil war","date":"2013-12-01","issue":"December 2013","author":"Daniel C. Adkins","body":"The 2013 Virginia elections were unique in that it was the Democrats against the Tea Party. The Democrats seem to have won the state-wide offices although the Attorney General race is headed for a recount. The Tea Party's war on women's health aided the Democrats, as women voted in larger numbers for Democrats. The government shut-down also aided the Democrats by pissing off federal workers, their contractors, and the workers and businesses that support them.\n\nThe race was won partly because a civil war is starting in the Republican Party. There was much criticism of the Republicans' having a convention to choose their statewide slate. This tactic favors the extremists. Some business-oriented Republicans stopped funding their party and supported the Democrats. In other parts of the US, business-oriented Republicans are supporting candidates in primaries for the first time in order to minimize the Tea Party effect and get electable candidates. Demographic changes aid the Democrats and Asian-Virginians made appearances in several races.\n\nHowever, the multi-cultural environment of Northern Virginia and cities has not spread to southern Virginia. Given the Republican gerrymandering and the slowness of demographic change, we should not count the Tea Party out anytime soon.\n\nSometimes we question the time spent on elections. However, protecting the poor, workers, the environment, and stopping the war on women are important goals. Also there is an opportunity to organize our neighborhoods, condos, and apartments. A useful tactic we can do today is to get our apartment building or condos to post our polling places on our apartment websites. With the natural turnover of residents, it helps to get our allies to vote to the maximum extent. Also, in aiding elections we have a chance to meet politically committed people. Now is a time that many Democrats are wondering about what role their party has played in raising inequality in the US.

Our issues – joblessness and underemployment, a low-wage corporate regime, public revulsion at the moribund federal minimum wage and its visible consequences, and health implications of the lack of paid sick leave in local jurisdictions – are out front, for now. Whether they will stay in the public eye is at least to some extent dependent on the readers of this newsletter.The public's awareness of these issues has been driven by courageous workers at the bottom of the wage scale – at Walmart, at fast-food outlets and other bottom feeders that combine low wages with sub-fulltime hours to extract the cheapest of labor – who have pushed back against their conditions. Social media and some mainstream media coverage have raised the salience of these efforts. And local and state governments here and around the country are [*taking action*](http://meetup.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=5bb87cda33&e=003de9ccab) to raise minimum wages in the pathetic absence of any Congressional willingness to raise the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour.\n\nIn suburban Maryland and the District, a regional effort is nearing fruition. Montgomery and Prince George's counties have passed minimum wage bills that will raise the minimum in stages to $11.50 per hour by 2017. The D.C.

Fresh Look at the Second Wave","date":"2015-03-31","issue":"April 2015","author":"Lisa Foley Stand","body":"*\"Jane's not here. But we can have her get in touch with you.\" The caller is a woman with an unwanted pregnancy. Jane is the solution of her choosing – a safe but unlawful abortion performed by a skilled but anonymous woman of the Jane Collective, a project of the Chicago Women's Liberation Union in the 1960s.*\n\nJane is not here now either. Abortion was legalized to a degree by the Supreme Court's 1973 interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. Since then, however, countless new anti-choice laws have been passed and upheld. For many women in 2015, abortion is no more available than it was in the 1960s. Women still need Jane.\n\nWhat Jane represents in a broad sense and how to get in touch with her today – these are key questions for socialist feminism, and matters explored in a recent salon with Chris Riddiough. The March 19 program, \"Second Wave Feminism: A History and Evaluation,\" was co-sponsored by DC-DSA and DC NOW (National Organization for Women) and drew an audience of 20-30 people.\n\nRiddiough is a former leader of the CWLU (which disbanded in 1977), as well as an honorary DSA vice chair and past chair of the DSA Feminist Commission. Her talk touched on aspects of the women's liberation movement that can now be seen as distinct in the larger frame of the women's rights agenda of the '60s and '70s.\n\nOne aspect, Riddiough noted, was the tendency to \"understand the movement for women's liberation as part of the larger movement for peace and justice.\" Because many women's liberation leaders had experience in civil rights and anti-war efforts of the day, they viewed the \"struggle for women's rights as not isolated from other struggles,\" and believed that gender theory and strategy had to bridge the intersections with concerns of race and class.\n\nAlong with attention to theory came discovery of a historical perspective, as women collectively pursued and shared knowledge of past women's movements (in times predating Women's Studies in academic settings). As a guide to their work, members referred to the \"Juliet Mitchell Chart,\" adapted from the writings of British socialist feminist Juliet Mitchell.\n\nThe chart identified four roles occupied by women in society in which they are oppressed: production, reproduction, sexuality, and socializers of children. It was helpful to refer to these roles and the particular experience of oppression in them when defining areas of struggle.\n\nYet, while CWLU members did debate theory and were dedicated to a collective process of setting strategy, they were not about finding and following a \"correct line,\" Riddiough said. In practice, the CWLU was committed to engaging women in activist programs that \"met them where they were,\" which led to collective work on a range of issues and priorities defined by members themselves– health care, lesbian rights, access to public space for women's athletics, self-defense, as examples. Some of this work led to gains recognized today in Title IX in education, establishment of lesbian and gay rights, and increasingly strong LGBT presences in politics and culture.\n\nOn the other hand, as Riddiough acknowledged with nods of assent from listeners, results fell far short of some aims, and in other areas women have lost ground after short-term gains. Anti-feminist backlash seems particularly strong against efforts on many fronts to stop rape, sexual assault, and violence against women. Reproductive freedom, as noted, has been under constant attack. The degree of women's autonomy over their own bodies – individually or collectively – is still the most basic measure of women's freedom. For that, much struggle lies ahead, perhaps most of all in two of Juliet Mitchell's four domains — production and reproduction.\n\nSo, again, how do we get in touch with Jane?\n\nIn Riddiough's closing remarks, she offers a few suggestions. Though the CWLU ultimately disbanded as the Reagan era began to overpower the era of a new left in the '60s and '70s, the organization left a solid legacy. So, \"first, we need to know our history. When I talk to women who were active in the '60s and '70s, I hear over and over, 'We knew nothing about the struggles that came before us.' In school, for instance, history books had a sentence or two – if that – about the women's suffrage movement, for instance.\" The lack of knowledge and sense of continuity with past movements \"led us to reinvent the idea of feminism. Young feminists today don't have to do that if they learn the lessons of the past.\"\n\nHer second suggestion, almost an urging, is about what it means to be strategic. \"The political right with its War on Women has been really good at this.\" Keep a long view, accept that some victories will not be lasting, and use theoretical and strategic tools for action. \"Internet petition drives, hashtags that disappear in a few days, will not be enough to counter the right wing war.\"\n\nFinally, Riddiough affirmed the importance of strong organizations capable of supporting effective leaders, noting the seemingly weak structures of the short-lived Occupy movement. This point always resonates in a roomful of socialists and socialist feminists, often pulled away from an organizational center even as they have impact in other compatible movements.\n\nThere was Jane. But there was also the Jane Collective.\n\nFor more information about the Chicago Women's Liberation Union, visit the CWLU Herstory [*website*](http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUAbout/about.html).\n\n[*DC DSA member meeting hears of next struggles in Net Neutrality*](http://dsadc.org/dc-dsa-member-meeting-hears-of-next-struggles-in-net-neutrality/)\n\nTuesday, March 31st, 2015\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;* April 2015**\n\n*By Woody Woodruff*\n\nThe Feb. 26 date for the FCC decision on Net Neutrality was looming close as Metro DC DSA heard [*Free Press*](http://www.freepress.net/)'s Matt Wood on the subject at the membership meeting Feb. 15. Wood's theme was clear: the amount of corporate money engaged in this contest of titans means the FCC decision (which looked favorable to consumers and the concept of net neutrality at that point) would just be the first skirmish in a long contest.\n\nThe [*FCC's 3-2, party line vote*](http://dsadc.org/activism-pushed-fcc-ruling-on-net-neutrality/) to reclassify internet providers as common carriers under Title II of the FCC's own enabling legislation was a solid win for consumers and creators using the Net – which after all is based historically on a publicly funded US government \"Arpanet\" created by military and civilian researchers. And, as Wood stated, classification of internet providers as common carriers would return the state of play to that in place before George W. Bush's FCC chair, Michael Powell, decided against that status for the then-burgeoning Net business. The major telcom players had pushed for that non-decision. Powell is now the well-paid head of the cable and telecommunications lobby, NCTA.\n\nThe big players – Comcast and Time Warner, Verizon and AT&T – had been lobbying to keep their FCC classification as information services, not as common carriers/utilities, because reclassification as utilities would give the federal regulators far more control over their services, treatment of consumers and producers, and pricing.\n\nAs Wood warned at the DSA meeting several weeks prior to the ruling, it won't end there. Corporate profits for those big players depend on maintaining control – over prices and offerings, and over lawmakers whom they now will enlist to push back against the FCC. Marsha Blackburn, a rising member of the House GOP leadership, [*has filed a bill*](http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_nn_blackburn/?source=website_default) that would overturn the FCC ruling. She and the bill's co-sponsors have hauled in several hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from the major corporate players. And attorneys for the same corporate players have [*already filed two suits*](http://www.freepress.net/blog/2015/03/24/here-come-lawyers-first-net-neutrality-lawsuits-filed) to overturn the FCC ruling as well.\n\nEven though the astonishing outpouring of public comment on net neutrality pushed both FCC chair Charles Wheeler and even President Obama to endorse a stronger stance, Free Press and other anti-corporate Net activists face a formidable struggle to shore up the FCC ruling now that it's in force, Wood recounted.\n\nAnd the overall regulatory environment is still conditioned by the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which is generally an industry-friendly, deregulatory statute, as DSA member Carolyn Byerly, a professor of communications at Howard University, pointed out. That gives conservative appeals courts like the DC Circuit room to pick away at the FCC's stance.\n\nThe FCC majority grasped that corporate control was endangering the freedom and accessibility of the Internet, a game-changing technology. The strong stance that they took was not, unfortunately, the end of the story. It must be written by activists ready to fight corporations as they try to buy back what democracy took from their hands.","order":0},{"title":"DC Politics Roundup: Progressives Continue to Eye DC Special Council Elections","date":"2015-03-31","issue":"April 2015","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"With the special elections to fill two DC Council vacancies less than a month away, progressive DC voters are still trying to make sense of the cattle call of candidates in both of the contested wards – with 14 running in Ward 4 and 16 in Ward 8 – while many of the left-of-center organizations that routinely endorse candidates have yet to make their picks.\n\nWhile the herd of hopefuls is scurrying to make an impression on DC voters in what is likely to be a low-turnout election, they also are eager to pick up endorsements that may sway undecided voters and bring a last-minute surge of money and volunteer energy into their campaigns.\n\nIn the election for the Ward 4 Council seat, which Muriel Bowser vacated when she became mayor, Bowser's hand-picked successor Brandon Todd — her former campaign and Council aide — is sucking up much of the oxygen and money, and it will take courage for any organization that depends on friends in DC government to oppose him. Things are a little more fluid in Ward 8, the stronghold of the late Councilmember and former Mayor Marion Barry. Here Bowser is also playing kingmaker by endorsing former Barry aide LaRuby May, who has a large lead in fundraising. However, a few other candidates have enough of a name or record to possibly make a push, such as longtime DC voting-rights advocate Eugene D. Kinlow, former DC Shadow Representative Nate Bennett Fleming, and Marion C. Barry, the late councilmember's son.\n\n(For more information on some of the leading candidates in each ward, see [*this article in last month's *Washington Socialist**](http://dsadc.org/dc-politics-roundup-democracy-takes-a-back-seat-in-dc-special-elections/)).\n\nOne of the most-watched endorsements is that of the Metropolitan Washington AFL-CIO's Council on Political Education (COPE), which is evaluating the candidates in preparation for endorsing but as of press time for the *Socialist* had not yet announced its picks. DC for Democracy, a multi-issue progressive group, has announced it will make its endorsements on April 8. The Gertrude Stein Democratic Club, the influential LGBT group, is also studying the candidates in preparation for endorsement.\n\nOne notable group that has already made endorsements is the local chapter of the Sierra Club, giving its nods to Todd and Kinlow. The club's [*website*](http://dc.sierraclub.org/content/dc-chapter-sierra-club-pleased-announce-endorsements-april-28-2015-special-election) indicates the endorsement of Todd, in particular, was based less on his skimpy environmental record than on his responses to a questionnaire and his meetings with club leaders, while Kinlow was recognized for his role in local environmental-justice activism.\n\nMetro-DC DSA has no plans to make endorsements in the races.\n\nThe real question is: How many voters will care whom these organizations endorse? The answer is: probably very few, but in a close race with a large field of candidates, a key endorsement or two could make the swing enough votes to influence the outcome. This could be the case in the more competitive Ward 8 election; in Ward 4 the question is whether anyone can stop the Bowser/Todd juggernaut.\n\n**DC Government Takes More Confrontational Stance Toward Congress**\n\nMayor Bowser can be credited with the DC government's at least somewhat more assertive posture in confronting congressional attacks on home rule. Her determination to move ahead with implementing the voter-approved initiative to legalize marijuana, in the face of threats from Republican members and even a provision in the DC budget challenging legalization, is evidence of this new attitude.\n\nMore recently, she said she would not pursue the litigation initiated by former Mayor Vince Gray to overturn a referendum that unilaterally declared the District free from the congressional budget process. Gray and his attorney general Irving Nathan took the legalistic argument that notwithstanding DC's desire to stop Capitol Hill from meddling in its local affairs, the Constitution gives Congress legislative authority over the District. But for DC voters as well as Bowser and members of DC Council who supported the referendum, that was beside the point: DC, especially in the face of a more hostile Congress, will get nowhere politely requesting its rights; it must demand them. The District's goal is to become a state, and Bowser and allied members of the Council deserve a hand for trying to make DC act like one.\n\nHowever, the attacks from the Republican Congress keep coming. The latest assault is from arch-conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who introduced a bill to overturn two progressive measures enacted by the local government – one that would ban employers from discriminating against workers for using birth control or seeking an abortion, and the other to require educational institutions affiliated with religions, such as Georgetown University and Catholic University, to comply with the city's law banning anti-gay discrimination. While such a stand-alone bill stands little chance of passage – this Congress is hardly capable of agreeing on what day of the week it is – Cruz's posturing is more proof that DC will never be free of congressional interference until it achieves its goal of statehood.\n\n[*Economic (and cultural) consequences of the Internet*](http://dsadc.org/economic-and-cultural-consequences-of-the-internet/)\n\nTuesday, March 31st, 2015\n\n*By Woody Woodruff*\n\n***Review: The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age* by Astra Taylor. Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt 2014**.\n\n***The Internet is Not the Answer* by Andrew Keen**. **Atlantic Monthly Press 2015**\n\nAstra Taylor's examination of the cultural consequences of an Internet under increasing capitalist control sits in the midst of a flock of books that have taken on the varying parts of this puzzle.\n\nSome lament the effects on today's minds of low-friction information availability (often comparing it unfavorably with the pre-digital learning process, which we should remember privileged an elite of the learned who could afford access to education and books. \"Is the Internet making us stupid?\" asked writer Nicholas Carr – as if the milieu created by class-privileged access to knowledge has turned out so wonderfully for the masses. Others argue that the convergence of creation and consumption on the Internet is breaking down the old relationship between creator and public or consumer – and they cheer it. Taylor does not.\n\nAndrew Keen, like Taylor, instead looks with dismay at the rising inequality and job destruction that is resulting from many of the internet-related businesses rising on the ruins (more or less) of the industrial era. His concern is tonally different than hers – she is worried about the easy expropriation of intellectual property and the degradation of cultural life that has paralleled the supposed glories of an \"information wants to be free\" ethos. Keen, whose contempt (and envy) for the new, young overlords of Net business is unbounded, builds a case around numerous narratives of the degradation of communal life and employment in company towns like Rochester, N.Y. (Eastman Kodak, now defunct, leaving a hollowed-out and impoverished home base) and San Francisco, being gentrified and hollowed out from nearby by the new feudal barons of Silicon Valley.\n\nTaylor, a journalist and documentary filmmaker, focuses on the conformations of the net and its associated businesses that are squeezing creative people – artists, musicians, journalists and authors of both fact and fiction – out of the cash nexus. As this is happening, corporate interests take a larger and larger share of the monetization of the net while the public for these cultural goods gets more and more \"free\" content while paying heavily in other ways.\n\nAdvertising is the true coin of net commerce, driving significant business to Amazon and other netrepreneurs. Taylor calls advertising a $700 billion invisible \"private tax\" levied on the public, the internet user, and sealing further the fate of creative people who are increasingly asked to create for free in order to participate in cyber-distribution. The rivers of Europe that in the late middle ages were littered with gangs operating as tollkeepers at every defensible bend in their course have their counterpart in today's heavily trammeled Internet.\n\nAs vast and unmanageable as the Internet appears to the non-coder, it is \"vulnerable to capture by the private interests we depend on for access,\" Taylor observes, not too originally. But she weaves a significant and different narrative about the loss of power and control\nby the public as corporate forces inject the fluid of commerce into\nevery bend in the Internet's \"pipes.\"\n\nMany people, including some on the progressive and radical left, continue to see the Internet as a vehicle for revolutionary change because of its wide, low-cost potential for outreach. Taylor has a glummer view: the Internet has already largely been captured by capitalist forces and will be hard to pry from their clutches.\n\nKeen, who is frank about his own failure to get traction as an early dot.com entrepreneur in the transition of music from CD to online, agrees and highlights the contradiction: \"...while Paul Baran, Vint Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee consciously designed the Internet to be without a center, that distributed architecture hasn't been extended to the all-important realms of money or power. Here, the future is actually as *bordered* as the past.\" (italics in original) He later quotes journalist/historian John Naughton: \"In Darwinian terms these new corporate giants are just the latest stage in the evolution of the public corporation.\" Their goals— maximized profits, benefits to shareholders and CEOs, and rejection of unions, taxes and regulation – parallel those of the robber barons of the Gilded Age, Naughton continues, and they differ mainly in \"hiring far fewer people.\"\n\nTim Wu (author of *The Master Switch*) could have been summarizing the views of both in his NYT review of Taylor's book: \"Instead of serving as the great equalizer, the web has created an abhorrent cultural feudalism. The creative masses connect, create and labor, while Google, Facebook and Amazon collect the cash.\"\\*\n\nWu goes on to say \"virality is the promise that keeps the proletariat toiling in the cultural factories, instead of revolting and asking for something better.\"\n\nWu, in 2010's *Master Switch,* expertly showed how natural monopolies like telegraph, telephone, radio and television services overplay their hands under capitalist management and become fodder for regulation or even nationalization. He shares Taylor's concerns about a similar phenomenon wrecking the Internet before it can be wrenched to the proper use of the broad public. The struggle over \"net neutrality\" (a term credited to Wu as originator) has brought [*flashes of pushback*](http://dsadc.org/activism-pushed-fcc-ruling-on-net-neutrality/) from the wide public that uses, and sometimes creates, on this forty-year-old but continually \"new\" phenomenon. But capitalism, as always, starts better organized and the struggle is continual catch-up.\n\nRadicals in this game have to struggle just to avoid disorientation. A phenomenon disruptive of capitalism as it exists has to be the love-object of any self-respecting revolutionary, right? But the ethic of the Internet skews that notion. Taylor quotes the knotty formulation of Internet apostle Clay Shirky. His \"Shirky Principle\" – \"institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution\" – exemplifies for Taylor the ambivalent attitude that apostles of the disruptive qualities of online opportunity take toward the traditional one-way means of communication like broadcasting, TV and print news. Shirky, a popular media scholar, is one such, applauding the removal of the traditional gatekeepers from the mesh, or field (as Bourdieu would have it) of communication*. Here Comes Everybody*, Shirky titled his seminal book. Nevertheless, acknowledge Shirky and his compatriots, the material provided online is essentially what used to be available through the old media varieties – video, radio, news, entertainment, music. All that has changed is who is making money from it. The sociologist Bourdieu said that the \"field\" of communicative action was characterized by unequal power relations, and that in fact the powerful elements in the field employ communicative action to enforce their status. It's productive to explore, as Taylor and Keen do, what has really changed and what remains.\n\nKeen probably has an even better array than Taylor of examples showing that the power relations of this communication \"field\" are disrupted by the Internet but the result is an even more concentrated set of power relations – Internet entrepreneurs who dominate the field while employing almost nobody – and a proletariat of the Net that produces and consumes, but for whom the meter always runs the wrong way, pumping money in the direction of the narrowing group of powerful entrepreneurs.\n\nTaylor's caution, similarly, is that the old gatekeepers of content (publishers, broadcast outlets) have been replaced by new gatekeepers of the new mesh, the once-free World Wide Web. They are the Internet Service Providers who must be paid for access to the Web at all, as well as the lords of content and access like Google and Yahoo. Social media enablers like Facebook and Twitter occupy a slightly different sphere but are equally capitalist aggregators of eyeballs and access points – and money.\n\nKeen especially focuses on the background oligarchy of the ISPs: the U.S. government \"handed over the running of the Internet backbone to commercial Internet service providers.\" It was, Keen quoting here the words of venture capitalist John Doerr, \" 'the largest legal creation of wealth in the history of the planet.' \"\n\nTaylor's approach, says Michael Harris in a WaPo review of Keen's book, pushes to a \"more unabashedly Marxist conclusion.\"\\*\\* Certainly she touches many a lefty base: C. Wright Mills's extension of the concept of \"alienated labor\" to the middle management sphere in the '60s, adding \"If we want to see the fruits of technological advances widely shared, it will require conscious effort and political struggle.\"\n\nTaylor notes John Lennon's scornful view of the \"clever and classless and free\" self-image of folk in the US who are unable to grasp their own imprisonment in a deliberately covert class system. She suggests that makes it easy for them to embrace the notion that \"information wants to be free.\" Equally erosive of class consciousness is the well-cultivated Tea-Partyish resentment against cultural elites and expert authority, which emphatically is not \"striking a blow against the real powers.\" Such feckless misdirection of thinking is not limited to the Right.\n\nTackling the actual inequities and power differentials of capitalist society, she recognizes, is difficult for ordinary folk whose time is consumed by various dimensions of survival. \"Motivation and resources, time and power – these are not assets that are evenly distributed,\" Taylor asserts. And, we socialists would add, this is no accident, but a singular advantage of capitalism, to fill up the overscheduled daily lives of workers and consumers with coerced activities suffused with anxiety or outright fear of losing even a precarious foothold. Popular democratic activism is well tied down by these constraints. In the brave new world of the Internet, Taylor says, \"material and social conditions have not given way to will and imagination,\" contrary to the world-has-changed evangelism of Shirky and others.\n\nTaylor's concern includes the hollowing out of the creative process, with its consumers increasingly expecting free creative content, the new moguls of the Internet collecting a hidden tax from those consumers and the creators of cultural goods left with little or nothing to show for their labors.\n\nThis is a sad truth that was true before the Internet and will probably be true in the next iteration of human communication, whatever that looks like. The Net may have exacerbated this trend but it hardly initiated it.\n\nWorse, she argues, the pressure on creators has caused a race to the middle, with fewer and fewer genuinely radical, evocative voices and blander and blander, politically harmless content. For the capitalist overlords of culture, it is a reduction of risk.\n\nFor her fellow creators, Taylor calls for a shift \"from free culture to fair culture\" with established fair trade principles and a wider culture in which that fairness is encouraged. In contrast, \"a communication system left to the free market will not produce the independent, democratic culture we need. ... while the Internet could have offered an alternative to the sphere of commodity exchange, private and often monopolistic markets now dominate.\"\n\nTaylor suggest some market-socialist solutions that could help dislodge capital's foot from the neck of Internet and its users – industrial policy, state investment in the electronic infrastructure and research, with \"public option\" alternatives for Internet access. In fact, the FCC recently took steps to block industry-backed state laws prohibiting municipal wi-fi systems – a small shred of progress. Another Taylor proposal, a staple of European social democracies, is vastly increased spending on public broadcasting pegged to a sales tax on our electronic toys – and for commercial stations and networks to \"pay a market rate for spectrum licenses\" and a national sales tax on online sales, now levied only by some states and easily dodged by big corporations and their in-house tax lawyers.\n\nThe cash cow provided by the Internet to big corporations, after all, was originally derived from government R&D and public efforts like DARPA, where the Net was engendered – the free lunch for the corporations, she says, should stop and they should pay for what they are enjoying.\n\nTaylor, like Keen, falls into a difficult ravine, suggesting that valuable cultural goods are produced by a relatively small group of cultural creators who should be compensated therefore. Both push back against the democratic yawp of Shirky and others, who celebrate the access of ordinary folks to the tools of cultural creation and grassroots political discourse. In doing so they undervalue a real benefit of the Net, suggesting instead that the common sort has been narcotized by social-media brain candy, the \"cultural dupes\" of old-school, mass-society media theorists.\n\nSocial media are in fact a fascinating amalgam of brain candy and real sociopolitical stimulation, and offer as low-friction an opportunity for expression by all as history has provided so far. Keen and some of his cohorts – Nicholas Carr and others – feel the Internet has devalued knowledge by lowering the difficulty of gaining it. This seems a bit of sour grapes.\n\nOne can see why Harris suggested in his review that Taylor had a more nuanced revolutionary perspective, even \"Marxist,\" compared to Keen. Keen's sources are more other journalism and less thoughtful analysis, and the tonal difference between Keen's sometimes-shrill denunciations of Internet billionaires and Taylor's focus on their consequences is distinct. Both are in fact \"Marxist\" in the general sense that they recognize structural tendencies in capitalism itself that exacerbate inequality in information and its increasingly important commodification, while actively working against its remediation.\n\nBoth writers provide plenty of illustrative examples of those structural tendencies as they play out in the terrain of e-commerce.\n\nKeen's narrative and examples are more rococo and gossipy than Taylor's (Keen cheerfully refers to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg as \"autistic\") and in many ways a more fun read. His encounters with some of the princes (ain't no princesses) of Silicon Valley and its posh outposts in San Francisco make them seem nearly clownish in their degree of detachment from the society they count as customers.\n\nTaylor's focus on the way Internet discourse defaults toward the mediocre under financial pressures is a more useful, because less common, critique. These are two of a number of books that, taken together, keep us current on the remarkable impact of new technology on our lives and jobs, as well as the persistent truths about the behavior of powerful corporations in capitalist society.\n\n\\*\"Content and its Discontents,\" July 18 2014\n\n\\*\\*Michael Harris, *The Washington Post*, Jan. 2, 2015","order":1},{"title":"Good Reads for Socialists: April","date":"2015-03-31","issue":"April 2015","author":"","body":"Brentin Mock, Justice correspondent for the politico-enviro site *Grist*, explores the relationship of climate change and gentrification (in all its forms) in a thoughtful and novel way. *Grist* has been running a series on gentrification; links are with this one: [*http://grist.org/living/climate-change-is-the-ultimate-gentrifier/*](http://grist.org/living/climate-change-is-the-ultimate-gentrifier/)\n\nTom Edsall, in *the New York Times*, details the seismic shift among some prominent, formerly neolib economists – Larry Summers at the forefront – in the direction of interventionist and regulatory action to increase jobs and job demand.

Yet time spent in jail or prison reduces an individual's life chances in every respect, thus those caught in a prosecutorial web when young are penalized for a length of time far outlasting a prison sentence. This reality was the theme of a panel discussion sponsored by the Reentry Network for Returning Citizens at the Thurgood Marshall Center in Northwest DC on Wednesday, February 25. The purpose of the meeting, wrote Executive Director Courtney Stewart, was to \"continue the conversation to end the school to prison pipeline, end mass incarceration, recommend and create more alternatives to prison and diversion programs. The law says that a boy becomes a man at age 18, well many of us know that is not necessarily true in the case of our youth. So why are so many ending up in the criminal justice system with little chance of ever getting their life back together?\"\n\nEach of the panelists — Tracy Valazquez, Council for Court Excellence; Malik Burnett, Drug Policy Alliance; Marcy Mistrett, Campaign for Youth Justice; Reginald Williamson, Public Defender Service; Walter Johnson, Collaborative Solutions for Communities; and community activist Tony Lewis — spoke about the concrete programs or outreach efforts they are engaged in, yet they all also stressed that incremental changes, important as they are, need to be followed by more basic changes. The point was repeatedly made by panelists and by attendees commenting from the floor that taking youth away from the young through incarceration exemplifies the inhumanity of a system which victimizes people already victimized by poverty. Individuals with the fewest life chances in our highly inegalitarian society are those most likely to wind up in prison when they should be receiving an education or embarking on a career. In other words, those \"locked out\" become those \"locked up.\"\n\nAlthough recent years have shown some small improvement with the overall rate of incarceration (in DC and across the country) dropping, the absolute number of those in jail or prison is still growing. Nationally and locally some sentence reduction measures (such as marijuana decriminalization/legalization) have been enacted, some programs to ease the process of re-entry have been funded; however, while welcome these have failed to turn the problem around because counter-trends continue to marginalize and criminalize parts of the population. Gentrification is a prime example and has had a particularly harmful effect in our region where rising cost of housing is reinforcing pre-existing patterns of exclusion based on race and class – thereby making it especially difficult for young people to get a foothold in the economy even when they are employed. And the racial disproportion when it comes to arrest and sentencing is especially striking amongst young men; blacks between the ages of 18-19 are more than 9 times likely to be imprisoned than whites. According to the Bureau of Justice, almost 3% of black men were imprisoned on December 31, 2013, as were about 1% of Hispanic and 0.5% of white men (even that last number is itself far higher than what most other countries would tolerate). Meanwhile the percentage of women in prison rises from year to year – also especially impacting youth. Overall approximately 250,000 teenagers under the age of 18 are annually prosecuted in the adult criminal justice system.\n\nThe combination of repressive laws and racism is thus having a devastating impact on our society, on our democracy. The challenge is multi-fold – as meeting participants noted, the problems relate not only to excessive sentencing and unnecessary imprisonment, but also lack of funding for schools, housing, mental health services; a lack of jobs for youth, and a lack of jobs for people returning home after time in prison. Numerous initiatives are underway locally to address aspects of these problems – from the passage of ban the box legislation in DC (preventing employers from asking about criminal backgrounds on job applications), to the creation of job training and placement programs. Invaluable in and of themselves, these are preventing the existing problems from getting worse, and make the difference between building a life and struggling simply to survive for those whom they reach. But by themselves they do not go far enough – a more systemic solution is needed, rooted in a critique of the structures that create and sustain a society that locks out and locks up so many.\n\nSuch critiques and solutions are posed by articles written by political prisoners, prisoner rights activists, radical scholars – including Angela Davis, Sekou Odinga, Laura Whitehorn, Kevin \"Rashid\" Johnson — in the quarterly journal, ***Socialism and Democracy***. Having as its theme \"The Roots of Mass Incarceration in the US: Locking up Black Dissidents and Punishing the Poor,\" the issue was edited by Mumia Abu-Jamal and Johanna Fernandez. They pose the underlying problem in their introduction: \"While mass incarceration addressed the problem of redundant labor in urban centers and functioned as a tool of social control, it served ideological purposes as well. During this period \\[1980s-90s\\], crime became the new code word for black people, Latinos, and increasingly, for immigrants. These groups became the perfect scapegoats in the context of growing class stratification in US society. In response to the broader national economic crisis, US capital shored up its profits through a draconian project that cut wages, eliminated health benefits, and busted unions. The hysteria around crime on which mass incarceration was erected served as an important ideological tool, a kind of a palliative for disgruntled white workers and the middle class during this long period of economic austerity. ... The unrelenting criminalization of African Americans and of poor Latino communities over the last 35 years – the idea that these undeserving \"Others\" were taking advantage of the system and digging Americans deeper into a financial hole – was integral to the politics of neo-liberalism, deployed by Democrats and Republicans alike ...\" (p.9)\n\nThe challenge is to take the truth of that reality and connect it with the necessary work of individuals and organizations working for economic and social justice in other spheres of life as well as with those directly focused on reforming all aspects of the criminal justice system. An example of what this might look like was provided by Vijay Prashad in a ***Socialism and Democracy*** article that points to a different model of economic growth than the models pushed by liberals and even some progressives unable to see outside of the neo-liberal box. Writing about Newark, New Jersey, the road he suggests ought to be taken should be viewed as directly relevant to what we need to advocate in our communities, especially now with Mayor Muriel Bowser determining the course of action her administration will follow in Washington, DC and with political changes underway in suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nPrashad notes that, \"\\[municipal government could use\\] laws of eminent domain to seize whatever abandoned property is in the city limits; use funds from the city budget, from the stimulus bill and elsewhere to hire people from the neighborhoods to refurbish these buildings into community centers, daycare centers, local schools, indoor farmers' markets and petty workshops; turn the empty lots into gardens to grow edible crops and flowers, which can be sold. Put the unions and community organizations into the mix ... using their organizational capacity and experience as well as their budgets to reconstruct their urban landscape. Dramatic use of people's energies would help break the apathy and helplessness that leads to criminality, drug use, and poor nutrition.\"\n\nThis speaks to precisely the kinds of initiatives and projects the attendees at the Reentry Network for Returning Citizens forum were engaged with or looking to develop. Key is to find policies and practices that reach more than isolated individuals, but rather speak to and organize all who are impacted by corporate/political practices that undermine communities and lead people to blame themselves – or each other — for their particular plight. That too means breaking with the pious sounding notion that anyone can achieve anything and focus on changing structures that can enable people to turn wishes onto realities. Prashad's conclusion expresses that truth: \"there is no point preaching hope alone, for hope can sour if it does not come with either the concrete capacity of a popular movement or a concrete recognition of possible public policies. As the writer Lemony Snicket put it, 'A story about people inside impressive buildings ignoring or even taunting people outside shouting at them turns out to be a story with an unhappy ending.' It is necessary to consider better endings, which are themselves new beginnings – considerations of the needs of the people who have no wish to live lives of desperation and incarceration.\" Better endings that may help steer us all to port.\n\nAll quotes from ***Socialism and Democracy***, Vol. 28, Number 3, November 2014\n\nAssata Shakur's poem quoted by Joseph Ramsay, \"Revolutionary Relatability: *Assata: An Autobiography* as a Site of Radical Teaching and Learning.\" (pp 124-125)\n\nMumia Abu-Jamal and Johanna Fernandez, \"Locking Up Black Dissidents and Punishing the Poor: The Roots of Mass Incarceration in the US,\" (p 9)\n\nVijay Prashad, \"Towards a Happy Ending,\" (pp. 33-34)\n\n\n\nOther Sources:\n\n*Cardozo Law Review*\n\nLiz Ryan, Youth in the Adult Criminal Justice System, Vol. 35:1167, 2012\n\nOffice of Human Rights: District of Columbia\n\nCriminal Background Screenings and Employment – Fact Sheet for Job Applicants, December 17 2014\n\nRe-Entry Network for Returning Citizens Fact Sheets:\n\na) African American Males in Criminal Justice\n\nb) African American Males in Education\n\nc) African American Males in Finance\n\nd) African American Males and the Family\n\n\n\nVera Center on Sentencing and Corrections:\n\n\"Incarceration's Front Door: The Misuse of Jails in America,\" Report Summary, February 2015","order":3},{"title":"Maryland Notes: Assembly Getting Down To It","date":"2015-03-31","issue":"April 2015","author":"","body":"As mid-April's *sine die* finish for the Maryland General Assembly approaches, significant pressure points are emerging in the legislative session and other high-hopes projects are fading.

Byerly","body":"When filmmaker John Akomfrah decided to make a documentary about the legendary British intellectual and activist Stuart Hall a few years ago, it was because he saw Hall as the living embodiment of Britain's New Left movement of the 1960s and 70s. Hall died in 2014 of kidney failure at age 82, but he worked with Akomfrah to complete that film, *The Stuart Hall Project*, in his last days. The result is a brilliant production composed of footage from the BBC and other productions, still photographs, and new interviews with Hall and others who were part of the political and academic dynamics of those raucous years.\n\n*The Stuart Hall Project*, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2013, will be shown and discussed at DSA's monthly Salon, 7-9 p.m., Thursday, April 16, in Room 118 of the C.B. Powell Building, at Howard University. The event is hosted by the Department of Communication, Culture and Media Studies at Howard. Carolyn Byerly, a member of DSA, chairs that department and has arranged to host the monthly Salon featuring Hall's work. She will be joined in leading a discussion after the film by Howard faculty and students. \\[ALERT: The film will begin promptly at 7:05 p.m., so please arrive on time.\\]\n\nStuart Hall, born in Jamaica, was of mixed racial heritage and middle class. When he was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to study at Oxford in 1952 to pursue a doctorate in English literature, he expected to be received as an intellectual equal among his peers. Instead, he ran head on into institutionalized racial and class attitudes cultivated by centuries of British colonialism. Hall had arrived in Britain with anti-imperialist views, but the ensuing years would radicalize and move him Left.\n\nThe dark skinned people of the Caribbean Islands were pouring into Britain in the '50s to rebuild the war-torn nation, and while Hall was part of this so-called \"Windrush Generation\" (named after the steamship that gave them passage), in that he, too, was of the Caribbean region, he was not of the laboring class. Still, Hall felt alienated from most of his university classmates who had joined the bebop era and other trivial pastimes and he began to take greater interest in his own people.\n\nHall found himself drawn to the West Indian workers who were marginalized into segregated, poor areas of London and other cities and were beginning to develop campaigns to demand their civil rights. He also found friendships among a few other disaffected students – an array of White British, Trinidadian, Jamaican, Syrian, and Sudanese – who were interested in expanding their radical consciousness. Hall remembered that he and his Leftist friends debated \"with a fierce intensity\" to move beyond the narrow binaries of the Cold War, i.e., Soviet-style communism and Western capitalism. The year 1956 became the year of \"conjunctures\" when certain events indicative of the two faces of the Cold War collided to suggest a new direction for Hall and his friends. The first was the Soviet suppression of the popular Hungarian Revolution with tanks and troops; the second, the British and French invasion of and efforts to regain the Suez Canal Zone.\n\nIn seeking a third political space, Hall and his friends aimed to meld political analysis to activism. Hall, who was more affiliated with what he called \"an independent socialist tradition\" than \"communist humanism,\" would abandon his dissertation on Henry James at Oxford and assume editorship of what became the *New Left Review*. Hall was drawn to Gramsci's inclinations to \"displace Marxism,\" and to confront Marx's opacities and omissions, as well as to champion Gramsci's notion of the \"organic intellectual,\" i.e., the person whose wisdom is grounded in the daily lived experience.\n\nIn London, Hall supported himself with part time public school teaching and university lecturing, while he poured his energy into his new political and intellectual endeavors. All of the journal's writers were also engaging in organizing campaigns around a range of issues including racial discrimination, disarmament, and anti-imperialism, among others. Hall traveled around Britain, sleeping on friends' sofas and making friends among others who had already planted the seeds for a Leftist era – Raymond Williams, Edward and Dorothy Thompson, Richard Hoggart, Doris Lessing and others. Hall met Catherine Barrett, a feminist historian, in a nuclear disarmament campaign, in 1963, and they married a year later. Hall experienced racism at a particularly personal level in his new inter-racial relationship.\n\nThe DSA Salon will highlight Hall's centrality and contributions to the formation of the New Left in Britain in these years, including his institutionalization of Leftist analyses during his years as the director of the Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies at Birmingham University, 1972-79. Hall became known as the \"father of British Cultural Studies,\" but in fact, he was so much more than that. Hall also left his mark on the Open University, from 1979-1997, a television-based distance learning program, and later as chair of the International Centre of Visual Arts (Iniva) and other organizations.","order":5},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—April 2015 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"April 2015","order":-1,"date":"2015-04-02","body":"**Welcome to the April edition of the *Washington Socialist*, the monthly email newsletter of the Metro DC local of Democratic Socialists of America.**\n\nConventionally, this is April Fools Day, historically \"all fools' day,\" which has a rich history as one of the weapons of the powerless. In late medieval and early modern times surprising currents of rebellion were sustained by the yearly or seasonal festivals in which the authority structure, including property rights, was systematically subverted under a tradition rooted in the officially tolerated festivals that saw \"the world turned upside down\" and the oppressed classes crowned as lords of misrule. Mikhael Bakhtin found these rowdy upheavals in Rabelais and his contemporaries and Eric Hobsbawm, discussing how to write \"History from Below,\" argued that early festival-based episodes of rebellion could be found emerging in official, often judicial records to counter the authoritarian narrative provided by the literate elites. The sanction of tradition for festival-based class upheavals was key to what has been called the \"weapons of the weak,\" disruptive behavior somewhat sheltered or permitted by primitive, actually pre-Christian tradition that punctured whatever hegemonic hold the aristocracy had on everyday life – at least during the course of the festival.\n\nBy the sixteenth century, a more formal critique of property and conventional behavior rooted in part in the Reformation emerged (in Western societies), one that didn't need the cover of festival tradition. The famous or (today) not so famous \"Pope of Marxism\" Karl Kautsky examined, for instance, the rebel impulse in [*the Anabaptist uprising led by Tomas Munzer*](http://meetup.us5.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=17cc8c368f&e=003de9ccab) in the sixteenth century. The most religious among that group renounced property in total and held all things in common; others more practically were as anti-propertarian as needed; they \"have all things so far in common that they allow no one among them to suffer want,\" as Kautsky quotes another scholar. In a [*Jacobin article*](http://meetup.us5.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=8cf2ac7054&e=003de9ccab) late last year, the contributor Loren Balhorn noted \"Kautsky's attempt to reconstruct human history as a history of class struggles, in order to imbue his readers with a sense of historical tradition, revolutionary continuity, and moral obligation to the socialist future.\" The notion of continuity with the past rather than one in which industrial capitalism changes everything may have been Kautsky's way of dealing with the collapse of worker internationalism during the Great War, contrary to classical Marxist dogma if not the more nuanced Marx himself. But Kautsky's purposive interpretation of the role of property and its conceptual abolition weaves an important thread from history, through Marxism, and into today's notions of the roots of inequality.\n\nThough the best-known festival of social topsy-turvy was in the Saturnalia winter holiday, Twelfth Night tradition, it was no accident that many of the festivals allowing for inversion of social relations took place in the warmer months and we can take today's April Fool's Day as the beginning of the protesting season, a potential renewal of the spirit of Occupy that inverts property relations. The tradition of April Fool's Day as one for pranks played on others is a pale imitation of the more robust (if temporary) uprising against property and authority in the human past. As [*Steve Fraser's new book*](http://meetup.us5.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=7fca535f3f&e=003de9ccab) appears to ask: When will we stop giving consent and start demanding it? Is this the prank we are playing on ourselves?\n\n**EVENTS** Metro DC DSA's **membership meeting** Saturday, April 11 will focus on the upcoming steering committee elections; those who are interested in joining the local's executive committee should attend.

His recent book, *The Servant Economy*,\\* traces themes in the U.S.'s growing economic and social inequality since the Fordist bargain – increased worker productivity would be rewarded with increases in wages and benefits – began to unravel in the mid-'70s.\n\nThe nation's economic weakness remains unresolved, and this development, Faux said, is \"no accident,\" nor will a future crash be one. Two factors masked the decline since the 70s – the increasing number of persons in the workforce per household, and the persistent credit bubble. Those palliatives are now exhausted. \"By the mid-2020s we can expect a 20 percent drop in the real wages of the average American who has to work for a low or moderate standard of living,\" Faux writes.\n\nEven more critically, the gradual erosion of government's participation (at all levels) in the economy (other than as a customer for galloping military product sales) has paralleled the decline in workers' power to enforce that Fordist bargain and left the chips in the hands of the corporate elite and the governing class for whom they have become the essential supplier of funds.\n\nThe New Deal arrangement that saw important government participation in the economy lapsed \"with the age of Reagan, in which we still live,\" Faux writes in *The Servant Economy*. \" By demonizing, downsizing, and demoralizing civilian government—calling it the problem and not the solution—Reagan and his successors destroyed not only its capacity to plan but also its capacity to react to signals of trouble ahead.\" That era saw, Faux concludes, \"\"the last serious debate within the governing class on how the nation should respond\" to loss of jobs to globalization . \"The debate centered on the question of whether the country needed a specific industrial policy to save its manufacturing base.\" The neoclassical economic theory privileging private capital's prerogatives won out – in the Carter administration! — despite a remarkable consensus on the part of heads of major corporations that national planning was required. Faux doesn't include a critical event – the rapid defunding of the congressional Office of Technology Assessment , seen by the right as the locus of industrial policy. It was finally abolished by the Gingrich storm troopers during the Clinton administration.\n\nWithout a national planning consensus, development became increasingly dependent on the whims of private capital and clever marketing of social non-goods, and labor became an appendage, desperate to restore jobs even in an environment where all the power rested with management. \"The age of Reagan greatly strengthened the class solidarity of our financial elites and therefore their ability to offload the costs of their folly \\[impervious to evidence\\] onto the rest of us.\"\n\nThis has sharpened public distrust in these major institutions. \"The catch-22 for the Left: 1. Reversing middle-class decline requires that the government intervene in the economy; 2. The influence of money in politics guarantees that the government will intervene on behalf of corporate interests, not the middle class; and 3. Therefore the middle class will distrust the government and will not support its intervention in the economy.\"\n\nFaux tells the AFL-CIO's interviewer, Tula Connell, \"Media talking heads complain that Washington is 'dysfunctional.' But it is functioning very well—in the interests of those at the top of the economic pyramid,\" including the governing class of both major parties.\n\nThis disparity, clearly, persists in the energy sector, where state and federal governments can't generate funds for public goods, and status-quo development is embodied in the privileged status of Big Oil. The split between environmental and labor progressives over projects like the Keystone pipeline, by any measure a planet-wrecking activity, demonstrates the dependence of what jobs are left on the movement of private capital.\n\nFaux's solution is a progressive coalition around a constitutional amendment to overturn the devastating Citizens United decision that opened the (already breached) floodgates of corporate cash into the electoral arena . If the running sore of corporate cash stands, Faux argues, the \"governing class\" will become more and morethe chattel of the corporate agenda and \"return us to a pre-New Deal set of social relations\" ... a \"Servant Economy\" in which the rights of workers are minimized, \"the humiliations of daily working life under raw capitalism will return.\" and the labor force is increasingly forced into personal services rather than the making of products.\n\nFaux suggests that a wide swath of voters beyond the left is convinced that there is too much money in the political system, and that a winning coalition could be built around a constitutional amendment to reverse Citizens United. \"If the last four years have taught us anything, it is the power of money to intimidate the governing class,\" Faux told the EPI audience. \\*(Jeff Faux: *The Servant Economy: Where America's Elite is Sending the Middle Class* John Wiley & Sons 2012.)","order":2},{"title":"Invitation to the New Activist Committee","date":"2012-09-01","issue":"September 2012","author":"Coleson Breen","body":"As the local has continued to grow, it has become apparent that there is a great desire to make ourselves heard in local and national politics though non-violent direct action.

The local chapter of Democratic Socialists of America was active in the founding of Stand Up!, established as a non-partisan organization working for full democratic rights and statehood for the District.\n\nFor most of its highly active 15 years, Stand Up! has been an all-volunteer organization, funded through member contributions and other modest fundraising efforts. Last year, however, Stand Up! successfully applied for two major grants to launch a campaign to educate the DC public about the need for statehood and to stimulate discussion about strategies for achieving it. Supported by a $50,000 grant from the DC government and $1,500 from the Diverse City Fund, Stand Up! created the \"Free DC Freedom School,\" a unique traveling school bringing the statehood discussion to neighborhoods, churches and organizations around the District. The project was intended to fill a gap in the campaign in the statehood effort: While considerable effort and public funds have been targeted to lobbying Congress and seeking support for statehood around the country, not enough effort had been made to build a strong pro-statehood movement within the District. The funding enabled Stand Up! to provide compensation to a full-time executive director to head up the project. During the first half of this year, Stand Up! members conducted more than 20 teach-ins in all part of the District, engaging citizens in lively discussions of what statehood would mean for the District. The project culminated in a District-wide \"Statehood Summit\" in June held at Howard University, where participants heard presentations from DC Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and other elected officials and activists. The summit produced a number of concrete proposals for advancing the statehood effort, including expanding the education and outreach efforts, engaging in direct action, filing lawsuits and pursuing a legislative strategy.\n\nStand Up!, building on the success of the traveling Freedom School, secured a second grant this year from the DC government to expand its outreach and education work. This $25,000 grant will be used to send 50,000 postcards to constituents in targeted congressional districts. The recipients will be asked to send a separate postcard to their member of Congress (via Stand Up!), asking him or her to support DC statehood. At the end of the campaign Stand Up! activists will hand-deliver the postcards to the targeted members, encouraging them to support legislation making DC the 51<sup>st</sup> state.\n\nStatehood would provide the District not only with voting representation in both houses of Congress, but also freedom from congressional interference in DC legislation and budgets. For example, Congress recently banned the District from funding abortions for poor women and has proposed further abortion restrictions, and has threatened to reinstate a ban on District-funded needle exchange programs to prevent HIV and AIDS. No state and no other locality is subject to this kind of federal micromanaging of its affairs.\n\nFor more information on the DC statehood struggle, visit [*www.freedc.org*](http://www.freedc.org/).","order":4},{"title":"What Forces Divide Environmentalists, Organized labor?","date":"2012-09-01","issue":"September 2012","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"Socialists in particular have at lot at stake in Blue-Green alliances – strategic coalitions formed between labor and environmentalists. Both are movements that socialists endorse and participate in. Farsighted labor leaders and workers understand that some big shifts in the working economy are on the way, and they had better have a strategy for it. Environmentalists are pitted against corporate giants whose interests in business-as-usual make them planet wreckers and, by virtue of their stake in the status quo, deniers of science.\n\nSkeptics might suggest that these coalitions are doomed because of a culture clash. To use some long-running stereotypes: College-educated, granola-crunching tree-huggers will never appeal to blue-collar union workers, they argue.\n\nThe blue-green alliances are unstable and constantly imperiled, all right – but not because of a bogus culture war. The problem has been the evisceration of national economic planning – the erosion of even the idea of democratic, public planning – in the rise of the right and of corporate dominance since the Reagan era. Labor is right to fear the effects of violent, unplanned shifts in industries, especially energy. The first casualty of poorly designed transitions is the workers, facing long periods of joblessness without retraining or support as the social safety net becomes threadbare.\n\nThis hasn't been a sudden shift. Jeff Faux and other left economists (*see related story, this issue*) trace the decline of manufacturing and redevelopment oriented toward public goods to the relentless trashing of government itself since the Reagan presidency, when, for instance, the first radical defunding of entities like the congressional Office of Technology Assessment took place with scornful comments about \"picking winners\" instead of letting the market do it. \"With Reagan's landslide \\[1984 re-\\]election, the United States was out of the business of thinking about the future,\" Faux writes.\n\nThe material product of green economic planning was environmental regulation, and corporations learned quickly how to battle it – with projections of job loss, targeting the fears of workers. \"Job blackmail studies\" like Ford's on the effects of fuel efficiency regulations \" were quickly picked up by the news media and echoed by studies produced by corporate dominated think tanks,\" one study summarized.\n\nInequality ensued: The loss of political power by labor as manufacturing declined and corporate power grew, coupled with the decline of government participation in the economy as resources dwindled, put the movement of capital almost entirely on the private side of the terrain. The Economic Policy Institute's George Sterzinger says \"Climate stabilization and energy security are public values that will not be delivered by private free markets acting alone.\"\n\nThe disputed Keystone pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, for instance, shows the dominance of private capital in these seemingly public projects. Two governments and at least one large international union, the Labors International (LIUNA) became the dog wagged by the tail of Big Oil's exploitation of the tar sands deposits of Alberta. No government, including the Canadian conservative regime of PM Stephen Harper, appears able or willing to undertake large wind or solar development – because corporate money would not underwrite it. But Big Oil is unmoved by \"public values.\"\n\nIn Maryland, a labor-green alliance has fought for more than three legislative sessions to put the state's puny resources behind an offshore wind project. Steelworkers have come around to the notion that erecting big turbines in the shallow waters off Ocean City would mean many jobs – more, if some of the materials could be fabricated in the state.\n\nBut the struggle has been complicated by Maryland's inability to finance the project itself. Private capital must be tempted by sweet deals from the legislature and – of critical importance – a renewal of the federal tax advantages for wind power development. The current cheapness of natural gas has put that goal nearly out of reach. Maryland, thanks to former GOP Governor Bob Ehrlich, blew all of its bond capacity for years to come on the Inter-County Connector, the controversial 18-mile toll road from Montgomery to Prince George's suburbs, which is rapidly revealing itself as a white elephant. (It must be admitted that Ehrlich's successor, Democratic Gov. Martin O'Malley, dodged his chance to scale back the now-completed project).\n\nEven as the offshore-wind forces gear up for another tilt at the Maryland legislature in January, the labor-green alliance has been stretched to the breaking point by a real divide. Frederick County is preparing to build a trash-to-energy incinerator costing over a half-billion dollars. To have enough fuel to run at capacity, other counties must send their trash along as well. Prince George's – whose last giant landfill is four or five years from being filled up – along with Washington and Howard counties have shown interest in contributing their trash.\n\nThe project, which Frederick County workforce officials claim would create 1,600 jobs, has been irresistible to the state's labor community. One state labor official said there were assurances that most of the jobs would be union.\n\nEnvironmentalists oppose the incinerator because they are campaigning to get their counties to promote a zero-waste mentality that will reduce the waste stream and promote re-use and recycling by consumers, including composting and utilization of food waste. To them, the incinerator is an incentive to produce more trash (and revenue), not less.\n\nThe state and its counties are at the mercy of private capital in both instances. Wheelabrator Technologies, which will build the incinerator by 2015 and subcontract the construction, appears to be footing nearly half the cost, with Frederick County in for about $361 million. That is way more than the $260 million in bonded indebtedness the Fitch bond rating company estimated Frederick would issue all the way through 2018 – as it rated Frederick \"AAA.\" As usual, the public faces the shortfall while the private capital can waltz away.\n\nThe inability to democratically, publicly plan for the future that comes with the disproportionate amount of capital in private hands puts both environmentalists and labor behind the 8-ball. Campaigns to right the inequalities that have crippled public policy since the Reagan era are almost certainly prerequisites to permanently securing the green-labor bond.","order":5},{"title":"Annals of Capitalism Dept.: The \"Ultimate Disruptor\" at the Washington Post","date":"2013-09-02","issue":"September 2013","author":"every economic status quo.","body":"> *By Andy Feeney* > > **Superman to the rescue? Jeff Bezos & the economics of change**\n\nAfter years of falling ad revenues circulation and shrinking circulation, the *Washington Post* may have found an economic savior. In August, CEO Donald Graham announced that after owning the *Post* for some four generations, his family is selling the paper for $250 million in cash. The purchaser is billionaire Jeffrey Bezos, famed in business circles for having turned Amazon.com into a global powerhouse, then successfully diversifying his company beyond the publishing field into many other Web-related markets.\n\nMany media observers hope Bezos, with a fortune estimated at $25 billion, has such deep pockets that he can afford – if he wants – to keep the *Post i*n existence for decades, even if it never becomes profitable again. They also say that Bezos also has shown himself a remarkably patient investor, at least for an American, displaying an almost Japanese-style willingness to endure years of low profits or none at all to fashion Amazon into a highly lucrative electronic empire.\n\nThis makes him fascinating to journalists who have long lamented the tendency of many other US business executives to pursue exactly the opposite path – to sacrifice the future welfare of great business enterprises to the short-term goal of keeping big institutional investors happy.\n\nAs noted by admiring reporters , Bezos since the mid-1990s has become one of the world's richest people by initially frustrating his own investors, \"refusing to realize Amazon's profit potential\" for the first seven years of the company's existence, to quote Adam Lashinsky in an admiring article in *FORTUNE* magazine.\n\nRather than deliver dividends to investors, Lashinsky notes, Amazon under Bezo's leadership invested aggressively in expansion and the domination of its chosen field, then moved beyond publishing to invade other kinds of online retailing. Beginning in 2002, profits then started to pour in. Partly as a result, Amazon's stock price has risen by 10 times over just the last 6 years, and Bezos has become a multi-billionaire.\n\nTo Bezos admirers, this speaks well for the patience and sheer capitalist skill and determination that he could bring to the *Post* as its new owner.\n\n**Liberal and/or Libertarian Politics:Bezos as Champion For Gay Marriage – and Maybe For Literacy, Too**\n\nBezos in leading Amazon.com also has reportedly proven himself to be a reader and a lover of the printed word, which some observers think bodes well for the future of journalism at the *Post.* His politics are liberal enough \\[or possibly just libertarian; one of his charities is reported to be *Reason* magazine\\] for him and his wife to have donated more than $2 million to a recent gay marriage referendum in Washington state.\n\nLargely because of his politics, his reading habits and his fortune, then, Bezos is being hailed by some as a potential champion for the kind of serious journalism that has led the *Post,* especially since the Watergate affair, to be a major force in local, national and global affairs.\n\nIn capitalist terms, in short, it's arguable that Bezos has the potential to become a newspaper publishing hero – a multi-billionaire who will fight for sane and intelligent journalism, just as Rupert Murdoch has vigorously fought for the opposite kind.\n\nBut why are the pundits so impressed by Bezos and his purchase of the Graham family flagship? Is it because of his politics and his money alone?\n\n**The Way of the \"Great Disruptor\"**\n\nNo one who is looking forward to Bezos's stewardship of the *Post* is calling him a sentimentalist, an enormously rich entrepreneur who just happens to revere the legacy of Woodward & Bernstein's coverage of Gordon Liddy and other Watergate ne'er-do-wells.\n\nInstead, *FORTUNE*, in naming Bezos businessman of the year in 2012, called him \"the ultimate disruptor,\" one who has \"upended the book industry and displaced electronics merchants.\" Rather similarly, a business analyst named Susan Bidel at Forrester Research, quoted recently by the Associated Press in a story about Bezos, calls him a \"premier disruptor.\"\n\nNoted author and *New Yorker* staff writer Ken Auletta, speaking in August on the *Diane Rehm Show*, also has echoed *FORTUNE* and the AP by tagging Bezos as \"the great disruptor in technology.\" And in the online publication *Insurance & Technology,* reporter Katherine Burger recently hailed the \"disruption Jeff Bezos brought to the world of retailing\" for the role it has played in the insurance industry's entry into web-based sales.\n\n\"Disruptor,\" \"disruptor,\" \"disruptor.\"\n\nSo the *Post's* last great hope for survival now apparently lies in the hands of a man famous for being a \"disruptor\"?\n\nIf so, why is this *supposedly* a good thing?\n\nIn recent American elections, how many presidential candidates actually have won the Oval Office by promising to \"disrupt\" the U.S. economy?\n\nWith the exception of those anarchist malcontents who recently supported the Occupy protests, and except for a handful of extreme environmentalists and some radical socialists as well, how many ordinary Americans look forward to an economic future marked by \"disruption\"?\n\nWould even most DSA members willingly sublet an apartment or a house to a tenant who promised to \"disrupt\" it? Probably not.\n\nWhy, then, are journalistic observers ranging from *FORTUNE* to the *Diane Rehm Show* now praising Bezos for his disruptor skills?\n\n**On \"Revolutionizing the Instruments of Production,\" As Marx and Michael Harrington Saw It **\n\nFor many democratic socialists, it is no news that our capitalistic economy thrives on significant change – even disruptive change.\n\nWriting more than 160 years ago in the *Communist Manifesto*, Marx and Engels proclaimed that the capitalist investor class, the \"bourgeoisie\" as they called it, \"cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with these the whole relations of society.\"\n\nThis made industrial capitalism unlike any other form of economic organization that had gone before it, Marx and Engels argued. As they put it,\n\n\"Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form was the first condition of existence for all previous industrial classes. \\[But\\] constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones.\"\n\nLater on in *Capital* and the *Grundrisse*, Marx went beyond such largely rhetorical flourishes to explain the mechanisms of why and how capitalist economies repeatedly generate radical economic change.\n\nMarx noted that repeated capitalist investments in labor-saving machinery have much to do with this; he also credited capitalists with having an obvious self-interest in the more efficient use of raw materials and natural resources in their factories, and thus in underwriting the development of many kinds of resource-saving technologies.\n\nBut more fundamentally, Marx thought, the primary factor behind constant revolutionizing of production in capitalist societies is the very nature of the capital accumulation process itself.\n\nThrough investing capital, reaping profits from such investments, then reinvesting the profits in even more profit-generating activities, wealthy investors in capitalist societies generally attempt to make their large fortunes grow ever larger, without limit, and in this way force modern industrial societies always to push \"beyond a boundary\" set\nby every economic status quo.\n\nThis process of capital accumulation repeatedly reshapes the way that entire industries and entire nations work, Marx indicated in *Capital* and the *Grundrisse*. Many Marxists agree that ultimately, this is unsustainable. In Marx's view, it leads the process of industrial production to become ever more capital-intensive, and relatively stingier in its payouts to labor, so as to push down profit rates over time – thus putting the entire system in crisis.\n\nIn the shorter term, Marxists tend to agree, unchecked accumulation of capital, because it is not sustainable, generates depressions and financial panics, crises of seeming over-production that can be resolved only when large quantities of capital investment are destroyed.\n\nIs this the sort of \"disruption\" that readers of the *Post* — not to mention the printers who physically produce the paper, the delivery people who get it to the readers, and the vendors who ultimately provide the publishing company with newsprint and ink — should expect in coming years, as Jeff Bezos patiently steers the company back to profit-making again?\n\nIn truth, the future prospects of the Post's unionized workforce under Bezo's leadership seem mixed at best.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————\n\n*\"There will, of course, be change at* The Post *over the coming years ... The Internet is transforming almost every element of the news business ... There is no map, and charting a path ahead will not be easy.\"*\n\n> – **Jeff Bezos, August 5 letter to employees of the > *Washington Post,*about his recent purchase of the paper for $250 > million in cash** > > ————————————————————————————————————————\n\nThe Graham family has a long history of abusing its unionized printers and writers, and some labor observers suspect that Bezos might have to go a long way to treat the Post's workers any worse. Representatives of the Post's organized workforce so far have seemed cautiously optimistic – at least in their public statements – on what Bezo's takeover may mean for the paper.\n\nYet Bezos could eliminate the jobs of printers and *Post* distributors completely if he transforms the paper into an entirely electronic publication, which is not beyond what some observers expect he could do. And critics say that Amazon under his leadership has engaged in union-busting in Germany.\n\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/05/business/workers-of-amazon-divergent.html?_r=1&>\n\nAccording to a *Huffington Post* story from September of 2011, meanwhile, employees at an Amazon warehouse in Allentown, Pa. not long ago were forced to work long days in 110 degrees heat or risk being fired.\n\nAccording to the Lehigh Valley, Pa., *Morning Call* article of Sept. 11, 2011 on which the *Huffington Post* story was based, Amazon kept paramedics on staff at the warehouse to care for individuals suffering from excessive dehydration and heatstroke. However, the company did not invest in costly air-conditioning equipment that might have solved the over-heating problem.\n\nMeanwhile, employees failing to meet high productivity standards were \"threatened with termination,\" with some losing their jobs and being escorted from the facility in view of former coworkers – a sight that \"encouraged some workers to conceal pain and push through injury\" for fear of being fired as well.\n\n<http://www.mcall.com/news/local/amazon/mc-allentown-amazon-complaints-20110917,0,6503103.story#ixzz2dOoeydWi>\n\nIn hailing Bezos as a \"great disruptor,\" though, it is unlikely that even FORTUNE magazine is expecting him to act just like a 19<sup>th</sup> century robber baron in his treatment of workers. Nor is it probable that Ken Auletta and Diane Rehm truly believe he will \"revolutionize the instruments of production\" in exactly the ways that Marx might have predicted.\n\nDSA's co-founder Michael Harrington, who followed Marx in characterizing capitalism as a relentless agent of constant economic change, once wrote that American capitalism truly is a more \"revolutionary\" economy than Soviet Communism ever hoped to be, except that economic revolution in the US is generally being driven by conservative Republican business executives who hate large-scale economic planning, and hence generate economic \"revolution\" by accident – with sometimes humorous, sometimes tragic results.\n\nBut it seems unlikely and Ken Auletta of the *New Yorker* and Katherine Burger of *Insurance & Technology* online are thinking about \"disruption\" precisely as Michael Harrington portrayed it, either. So what are they talking about?\n\n**The Harvard Prof Who Popularized Disruptive Innovation:**\n\n**How Big Firms Can Solve the \"Second Mouse\" Problem**\n\nA good guess is that many of the media mavens consider Bezos a hero for the ways he seems to promote the sort of \"disruptive innovations\" that an eccentric Harvard Business School professor named Clayton Christensen has promoted in a recent string of best-selling books on corporate strategy.\n\nChristensen now has a rather ambitious web site promoting his theories, while also extolling his religious faith in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints – at least until recently, one of his web pages cited his experiences as a Mormon missionary and explained how it contributed to his economic vision.\n\n[*http://www.christenseninstitute.org/*](http://www.christenseninstitute.org/)\n\nBefore launching the web site, though, Christensen achieved fame in business circles as the author of *The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail* (1997), his first breakthrough publication.\n\nAlong with coauthor Michael Raynor, Christensen also wrote *The Innovator's Solution: Creating and Sustaining Successful Growth* (2003). And through these and other books of similar cast, he has won real fame in business journalism circles for his ideas on how innovation works.\n\nIn *The Innovator's Dilemma,* Christensen addressed what some people have called the \"Second Mouse Problem,\" as in: \"The early bird gets the worm; but it's the second mouse that gets the cheese.\"\n\nGreat companies that already are investing significant resources in innovation, Christensen noted, chiefly to keep existing customers happy and exploit the higher-income levels of a given market, often get undercut in time by \"disruptive,\" smaller rivals that initially focus on making lower-quality products, or exploiting seemingly less promising technologies, or serving a lower income customer base, or all three.\n\nExamples of \"disruptive\" innovation as defined by Christensen include the PC computer makers of the early Internet age who eventual undercut and out-competed IBM and other big mainframe computer makers. A second example is the saga of Toyota in the 1950s and 1960s initially focusing on making cheap, seemingly low-quality cars that would never compete with Detroit, then moving up-market and eating Detroit's lunch in the long run.\n\nStill another example mentioned on Christensen's web site is the way that discount retailers in recent years have undercut and sometimes bankrupted traditional, full-service department stores.\n\nSuch \"disruptive\" innovators – the \"second mice\" in the joke mentioned above — succeed by exploring obscure market niches, and by initially accepting low profit rates as well, so as to invest in the future. In this way they eventually grab huge chunks of market share from their bigger, better-established rivals (the \"first mice,\" who sprung the trap) and replace those rivals at the top of the corporate food chain.\n\nThis was the problem for large, established, somewhat high-tech companies that Christensen described in *Innovator's Dilemma.* In *Innovator's Solution* and several other books since then, he has gone on to formulate solutions for it.\n\nAccording to Christensen and Raynor, bigger and more established companies, to survive, also need to explore the lower ranges of their markets and the initially less attractive technologies or products that serve them. They need to innovate constantly, and not merely through introducing annual model changes to please high-income customers. Instead, they constantly need to work on innovations that will expand their markets to a larger, lower-income customer base.\n\nIn doing so, they, like their upstart rivals, will turn former luxury goods – like personal computers or cell phones, say, into mass market commodities — one aspect of \"disruptive innovation\" that makes it a positive force, in Christensen's view of the universe.\n\nFinally, Christensen states, big innovative companies need to accept lower-short term profits in pursuit of higher long-term market share, so that they beat potentially \"disruptive\" rivals at their own game. Clearly, several aspects of Christensen's \"disruptive innovation\" model seem to fit Bezos's style of corporate management at Amazon, which is probably why his admirers hail him for being such a disruptor.\n\nBut beyond Christensen, there is an older economic theorist of disruptive change who has inspired many American business journalists for the past 35 years or so.\n\nTo put Christensen's ideas into context and to understand the moral universe of American capitalism and its defenders today, progressives would do well to familiarize ourselves with the work of the great Austrian-born economist Joseph Schumpeter.\n\n**The Disruptive \"Entrepreneur\" as Economic Hero: Schumpeter's Vision of Capitalism as Creative Destruction**\n\nMany decades before Christensen won fame for his insights about \"disruptive\" innovation, Joseph Schumpeter of Harvard, an Austrian-born conservative who had studied Marx at the University of Vienna and had a fundamentally conflicted view of Marx's economic ideas, laid the groundwork for American business journalism's contemporary love affair with radical economic change.\n\nIn his best-known work, *Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy*, first published in 1942, Schumpeter broke with some conservative critics of the New Deal, and with its radical and liberal defenders as well, by arguing that most of their theories about advanced capitalism were irrelevant, for they relied on basically static models of an economy that – as Marx had insisted earlier – is fundamentally revolutionary.\n\n\"The problem that is usually being visualized is how capitalism administers existing structures, whereas the relevant problem is how it creates and destroys them,\" Schumpeter wrote in *Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy*.\n\nAs he put it:\n\n> \"The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the > organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such > concerns as U.S. Steel illustrate the same process of industrial > mutation – if I may use that biological term – that incessantly > revolutionizes the economic structure *from within*, incessantly > destroying the old one, incessantly creating the new one. This process > of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is > what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got > to live in.\"\n\n\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Schumpeter was a major figure in American economics and in 1947 was elected by his peers to be president of the American Economic Association. His relationship with socialist and leftwing economists of his day was a curious one.\n\nIn *Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy*, rather memorably, he professed to believe that capitalism would not survive in the long run, although he greatly preferred it to socialism. He *further* argued that a socialist economy could be economically workable and democratic in form – although a recent biographer, Thomas McGraw, contends in *Prophet of Innovation: Joseph Schumpeter and Creative Destruction* that Schumpeter was being deeply ironical in this positive portrayal of socialism, and that a close reading shows he meant the opposite of what his words seemed to say.\n\nWhatever Schumpeter's real feelings about socialism's potential, however, he served at Harvard as the mentor of the radical son of a respected banking family, Paul Sweezy, who went on to found and edit *Monthly Review*, then and now the leading independent journal of Marxist economics in the United States. The two men reportedly never agreed about the merits of socialism and capitalism, yet Schumpeter admired intellectual brilliance wherever he found it, and according to McGraw's biography, Sweezy became his favorite student, out of an impressive cohort of potential Harvard rivals.\n\nAs McGraw's points out, however, Schumpeter despite his affection for Sweezy was first and foremost the champion of the capitalist entrepreneur, the kind of disruptive business innovator whose vision and daring made \"Creative Destruction\" \\[in Schumpeter's view\\] so successful.\n\n**The Entrepreneur As Economic Hero: \"His task is breaking up old, and making new, tradition\"**\n\nOver a career stretching from 1911, when he first described the entrepreneur as the agent of creative and disruptive change, to his death in 1950, Schumpeter centered his theoretical focus on entrepreneurs and what motivated them, as well as what they contributed to long-term economic progress – at least, \"progress\" in Schumpeter's terms.\n\nIn his groundbreaking *Theory of Economic Development*, in 1911, Schumpeter went to some pains to describe the motivations of the men – in his view, they tended to be men – whom he considered central to capitalism's health, if not its survival. As he wrote back then,\n\n> \"The typical entrepreneur is more self-centered than other types, > because he relies less than they do on tradition and connection and > because his characteristic task – theoretically as well as > historically – consists precisely in breaking up old, and creating > new, tradition.\"\n\nRather than merely being motivated by money, Schumpeter thought in 1911 – although he could later defend \"entrepreneurial profits\" – the typical entrepreneur was inspired by \"the dream and the will to found a private kingdom,\" often a family business that could be passed on to heirs.\n\nAs part of this aspect of the entrepreneurial character, Schumpeter wrote, \"there is the will to conquer: the impulse to fight, to prove oneself superior to others, to succeed for the sake, not of the fruits of success, but of success itself.\" And last but not least, \"there is the joy of creating, of getting things done, or simply exercising one's energy and ingenuity.\"\n\nAs McGraw's extremely pro-capitalist yet still impressive biography points out, Schumpeter also credited entrepreneurs, aided by the advertising industry, with essentially creating new wants for the masses, since the possibilities that the satisfaction of basic needs offers to disruptive innovators is rather small. Good entrepreneurs create economic demand for new goods, Schumpeter thought; they do not simply follow it. And advertising leads the way.\n\nSchumpeter also believed that speculative venture capitalists, not the patient savings of virtuous widows or even established business owners, made a key contribution to the ways that entrepreneurs helped pull capitalist markets out of potential stagnation.\n\nAided by venture capital which bankers in many cases create out of virtual thin air, Schumpeter believed, entrepreneurs can revitalize potentially stagnant economies through the introduction of\n\n\\(a) new or unfamiliar goods,\n\n\\(b) new or unfamiliar methods of production,\n\n\\(c) the opening of new and/or unfamiliar markets,\n\n\\(d) the development or indeed the \"conquest\" of new sources of raw materials, and/or\n\n\\(e) the introduction of new kinds of business organization into an existing market.\n\n(McGraw, *Prophet,* 70-73.)\n\nWith this model of entrepreneurial activity in mind, McGraw indicates, Schumpeter over his long career opposed much of the New Deal legislation of the 1930s, on the grounds that it would discourage risk-taking by entrepreneurs and prolong the Depression.\n\nHe defended large quasi-monopolistic companies against critics who denounced them for stifling competition, on the grounds that large companies could provide entrepreneurs with momentary shelter from the \"great gale of Creative Destruction\" constantly roiling capitalist societies, and in this way could foster needed innovations that smaller firms might not be able to introduce.\n\n—————————————————————————————————\n\n*\"The changes in the offing will turn The Post upside down**.\"***\n\n> – **Janet Asteroff, commentator on PBS.org., Aug. 6, 2013**\n\n—————————————————————————————————-\n\nSchumpeter as he grew older also defended high, quasi-monopolistic profits for successful businesses, on the grounds they were needed to motivate entrepreneurs to take risks. He defended widespread economic inequality under capitalism for just the same reason.\n\nAnd in predicting the possible demise of capitalism in *Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy*, Schumpeter did so largely out of fear that government regulation and corporate bureaucratization were stifling the kinds of entrepreneurial zeal, and especially the ambition to establish family business dynasties, that made entrepreneurs tick.\n\nA bit like William Whyte in *Organization Man* (1956), Schumpeter lamented the effect of large-scale corporate capitalism on the radical individualism and soaring ambitions of potential entrepreneurs.\n\nWhy does any of this matter today, however?\n\n**Schumpeter as Theorist of Neo-Liberal Business Revolution**\n\nA little reflection, and the occasional look into such business publications as *FORTUNE, Forbes, Bloomberg's / Business Week* and *The Economist,* suggests that Schumpeter's ideas about Creative Destruction and entrepreneurial genius have inspired a large part of the Neo-Liberal, free-market revival that has played such a destructive role in U.S. politics since the 1980s.\n\nWith Schumpeter's ideal entrepreneur and Creative Destruction in mind, it can be argued, American business leaders for the last three decades have been rather cheerful about the outsourcing of industrial jobs to China: after all, this move into \"new markets\" is one of the hallmarks of innovation as Schumpeter described it.\n\nThe growing gap between the super-rich and everyone else in the United States is arguably a good thing, from the point of view of \"disruptive innovation,\" for big rewards help inspire the kinds of entrepreneurial zeal we want and need.\n\nThe self-centeredness and ruthlessness of such famed innovators as Steve Jobs also are good things, from a Schumpeterian perspective; that's what successful entrepreneurs are often like.\n\nIndeed, the small bookstore owners that Jeff Bezos helped to ruin economically, through the dazzling growth of Amazon, are just ancillary casualties of Creative Destruction, which preserves our vibrant capitalist economy by periodically disrupting and destroying entire industries, supposedly for the long-term benefit of everyone.\n\nPerhaps it is unfair to unload all of Schumpeter's legacy onto the head of Jeff Bezos, who has in fact made it easier and cheaper for many people to purchase books, and whose fortune has in fact helped to bankroll gay marriage initiatives.\n\nPerhaps Bezos will not prove to be as self-centered and ruthless an avatar of Schumpeter's ideal entrepreneur as Steve Jobs was at Apple*.* Perhaps he will save a great newspaper, and in doing so, perhaps he will treat the *Post's* current workforce a bit more kindly than Amazon's warehouse manager at Allentown apparently treated his heat-stressed employees back in 2011.\n\nBut at this point, with the *Post's* advertising revenues down and the entire newspaper industry in a slow crisis due to the shifting of advertising dollars to the Internet, Schumpeter's words from 1911 and 1942 are sobering reminders of just how destructive \"healthy\" capitalist change can often be.\n\nAs Bezos himself wrote in an open letter to *Post* employees in early August, \"There is no map, and charting a path ahead will not be easy.\" Just what kind of \"disruptive innovation\" that Bezos has in store for Post readers and Post employees, and perhaps even Post advertisers, will only become clear over time.\n\n*Editor's note: a complementary take on Bezos by Daniel Adkins is elsewhere in this issue.*","order":0},{"title":"Global Labor Solidarity: History and Hope","date":"2013-09-02","issue":"September 2013","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"**Variations on a theme/Elements of a future: Four Instances of Global Union Action**\n\n**** *US Labor Against the War*: a network of local trade unions and trade unionists that serves as an anti-war voice in labor and as a labor voice in the anti-war movement. USLAW supports the Congressional Progressive Caucus Budget as part of its \"Jobs Not War\" campaign and supports the Iraqi Civil Society Initiative non-violent resistance to the pro-corporate government and social structure left in the wake of the U.S. invasion. Calling for complete withdrawal of US military forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, USLAW also opposes direct or indirect US military intervention in the Syrian civil war. That position is consistent with solidarity for Iranian unionists confronting repression; a solidarity equally opposed to US economic sanctions and military threats against Iran. Building support between across battle lines, USLAW has brought oil worker and other Iraqi unionists to the US and delegations of US unionists to Iraq. And it has announced support for Chelsea Manning, joining defense of civil liberties threatened by the Patriot Act to its defense of US labor rights.\n\n*National Domestic Workers Alliance*: an organization of house cleaners and nannies, workers who enable other families to have two earners, enable better-off families to enjoy leisure those whom they employ don't have. Overwhelmingly female and immigrant, it is a workforce often forced to live outside of labor law and civil law protections; in consequence these are amongst the least paid and most exploited workers. NDWA has been waging increasingly successful campaigns to pass city-wide and state laws to improve their wages and protect their rights as workers and human beings. Despite being atomized at their workplaces, domestic workers have created ties of mutual support that cross neighborhoods and borders. Initiatives NDWA has taken in the United States parallel similar initiatives in Southeast Asia, in western Africa. Global coordination and unity between domestic worker networks and associations secured the first International Labor Organization Convention when \"Recommendation of Decent Work for Domestic Workers\" was adopted in 2011. NDWA is part of the United Workers Congress, which defines itself as \"... a strategic alliance of workers that are either by law or practice excluded from the right to organize in the United States.\" That network includes the National Guest Worker Alliance (NGA), which has also build up links with workers in the countries from which they come, leading to cooperation with the organizations comprising the Asia Floor Wage Alliance. That latter group is seeking a regional wage standard – based on a living wage – and respect for labor rights.\n\n*Coalition of Black Trade Unionists*: a constituency group within the AFL-CIO with roots in independent initiatives of African-American workers to gain full representation within organized labor and to build opposition to racism in society at large. International labor solidarity has been part of CBTU's program since its founding. Organizing opposition to apartheid South Africa at a time when most labor leaders were silent or complicit, in1974 it became the first national US labor body to call for an economic boycott of South Africa and for an end of US government support for the system of white minority rule. In subsequent years, CBTU condemned the Pinochet coup in Chile, the Abacha junta in Nigeria and the Duvalier regime in Haiti. Current stands it takes include support for Palestinians' right to self-determination, opposition to the U.S. boycott of Cuba and solidarity with Third World unionists struggling against anti-worker economic policies imposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Instead, CBTU calls for the U.S. to give African, Caribbean and Latin American nations aid and trade benefits equivalent to those of European nations; fairness impossible within the framework of free trade agreements. Therefore its focus today is the AFL-CIO's \"Campaign for Global Fairness,\" which supports debt relief, worker and democratic rights and enforceable rules for global trade and competition that values people over profit.\n\n*United Steelworkers*: an AFL-CIO union and a leader of coalitions that call for a national industrial policy that incorporates environmentalism. USW's equally principled international solidarity has been expressed in its ongoing support of the militant, independent Mexican National Union of Mine and Metal Workers battling police violence and government prosecution. Another form its policy takes is participation in global corporate union alliances, such as one at Caterpillar in which USW and United Auto Workers local unions coordinate bargaining strategy with sister unions from Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, France, Germany, India, and Japan. But most perhaps most significant is USW's joint initiative with Unite (the largest union in the UK and Ireland) to create [*Workers Uniting*](http://www.workersuniting.org/). Building a single organization across borders may be the most effective way to combat transnational corporate anti-union practices, and their promotion of anti-working class trade, financial and political programs that also cross borders. Yet the union's leadership recognizes that true unity requires understanding of difference. To that end, USW has joined South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers, unionists from Sweden, Britain and elsewhere to participate in a 4-year shared leadership training program. The goal is to create a framework for understanding the different legal systems, historical traditions and conditions of life workers face, to turn the reality of diversity into a strongpoint of a shared struggle.\n\n**Distinct Strands Woven Together: Labor History Themes**\n\n****Examples of the above can be multiplied – international solidarity built upon autonomous networks of mainly local unionists, those that are connected to or built upon independent grassroots movements, and groupings built within and through structured national labor bodies. These form distinctive, mutually reinforcing elements of progressive change in worker organization at home and abroad. Or at least in embryo; important as each instance, each campaign, forum, initiative may be, these are still far from able to match the strength and cohesion of global capital. Yet they do point a way forward and challenge the hopelessness that labor's decline creates; a decline that creates a permanent sense of insecurity among millions and makes a mockery of workers attempt to grasp hold of their own futures.\n\nSuch a grasp will only be made secure through an alternative power linking international labor solidarity to the ability of worker organization to defend rights at local worksites. The need and possibility of making that connection was already becoming clear two decades ago with the globalized economy impacting ever greater numbers of people. Paul Garver – an SEIU activist from Pittsburg who subsequently worked on corporate campaigns for the International Union of Food and Allied Workers headquartered in Switzerland – noted in a speech given in Australia at a 1990 conference on 21<sup>st</sup> century perspectives on the labor movement that:\n\n> \"The 'triumph of capitalism' does not bring history to an end.

Karl Marx did not spend all of his time in the > reading room of the British Museum – along with other socialists he > tried to create lasting international associations to link workers > across borders.\"\n\nForms of cross-border solidarity have existed since the birth of trade unionism – some of the earliest craft unions in the U.S. were initially extensions of British unions. The practical work of Marx to which Garver alludes was embodied in his work building the First International – the International Workingmen's Association – founded in 1864 partly to build support amongst European labor organizations for the North once the civil war's anti-slavery character became fully manifest, partly to counteract employers' attempts to have workers scab on one another across national borders.\n\nNonetheless, although capital, with origins in slavery and colonialism, has always been international, its initial power was more often expressed on a local and national plane. Therefore, in virtually all countries, the primary path of unionism has been from city-wide to national organization. Trade union strength in much of the world was at its height in the three decades after World War II based on national agreements; international solidarity often being more symbolic than real. Labor leaders tended to identify closely with \"their\" employers, their government.\n\nThat identification proved to be a recipe for disaster. The global tendencies of capital became more pronounced in those years, reflecting the inner logic of capital to expand and the use of that tendency to undo the concessions that previous labor victories had imposed upon business. The erosion of labor mobilization at the worksite and the atrophying of practical measures of cross-border organizing meant that initial efforts to rein in the growing strength of transnational capital as its power became more manifest from the late 1970s, proved toothless. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, corporate power abandoned all restraint, indulging in an orgy of militarism. Business interests used the lack of unified labor organization to leverage downward the conditions and rights of working people everywhere.\n\nThat lack of labor unity was particularly devastating in the United States. Anti-Communist purges within the labor movement during the late 1940s inhibited opposition to U.S. corporate global expansion and led to support for government foreign policy. \"Business unionism\" replaced militancy at home and abroad with consequences Beth Sims (from the solidarity organization, Inter-Hemispheric Education Research Center) accurately described in 1992:\n\n> \"As alternatives to class-based analyses, the AFL-CIO ... offer\\[s\\] > prescriptions for 'apolitical' trade unionism aimed at increasing the > size of the pie through enhanced productivity and labor's piece of the > pie through collective bargaining. The notion of class struggle is > inconsistent with the corporate labor-business relations advocated by > the AFL-CIO.

It has placed itself > on the side of governments and elites that prop up the global > dominance of the United States and the economic dominance of owners > over workers.\"\n\nSince the early 1990s, internal developments within U.S. labor contributed to a gradual change from the reality Sims recounted to the orientation Garver described. The necessity for a new global policy was a critical factor in John Sweeney's successful campaign to win election as AFL-CIO president in 1995; the initial steps toward a more progressive direction then initiated have been furthered and deepened in the years since. Far more, however, remains to be done; the break with the past was partial.\n\nHere too labor history needs to be recalled, for its path has not only been from small to larger, it has also been about intersecting paths of organization. One stream of unionism was chartered by skilled craft unionism, another embodied by a populist social unionism, and a third expressed in revolutionary industrial unionism. Visible in most countries, in the U.S. these took clearest shape in the American Federation of Labor from the 1880s forwards, the Knights of Labor in its brief rise and rapid decline in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, and the birth and destruction of the IWW soon thereafter. Elements of the best of all of these laid the basis for the rise of the CIO during the New Deal years. Strong inclusive workplace organizations came together with community-based and national progressive/left political movements, combining collective bargaining with social justice. The concessions to Cold War reaction Sims described eliminated much of the dynamism of all three elements and replaced them with a parochialism that lay the seeds of the weakness capital is unrelentingly attacking. The kinds of initiatives being taken today by fast food workers, by workers at Walmart, point to the possibility of a new synthesis – just as do the domestic and global initiatives undertaken by USLAW, NDWA, CBTU and USW.\n\n**Collective and Individual, Individual and Collective: Possibilities for the Future**\n\n****Current AFL-CIO direction is oriented toward building a coalition with other social justice organizations aimed at transforming the political terrain in the U.S. How to do so has been a recurrent theme of the Federation's (unprecedented) open discussion taking place in preparation for its September 11 -13 Los Angeles Convention. Many of the comments to date have focused on alliance-building goals; however, such plans will be realized only if coalition partners have equal voices in developing long-term as well as short-term strategy. The legitimate need to respond to the pragmatic interests of union members cannot be allowed to lead to an \"us first\" pragmatism that sacrifices fundamental working-class interests for immediate gains – which was the underlying rationalization for past policies that had such a deleterious impact in creating genuine global solidarity. Campaign strategies need to be combined with democratic forms of organization and democratic processes of coalition-building, a difficult but absolutely crucial aspect of building ties with working people abroad. Absent that, a campaign strategy can \"professionalize\" labor internationalism, making it fully staff-driven. Far better is to root global union activity in local union organization. By connecting international labor solidarity with other aspects of union activity, the rank-and-file will be better placed to take initiatives and be engaged in the development of policy. Thereby local organization and education can be equal parts of a multi-tiered process rooted in action.\n\nThe instances of labor international solidarity with which we began all speak to the possibility of creating such a movement. USW provides an example of how to increase the practical mechanisms of union-to-union solidarity, building upon existing organization that connects mutual action to mutual understanding; a solidarity that embraces difference. NDWA's roots in feminist, immigrant and anti-poverty grassroots organizing has helped create structures that are both flexible and strong. Thus an international movement has emerged amongst those employed in the smallest workplaces, connections created between workers whom law and circumstance, language and culture, tend otherwise to isolate. CBTU draws on the experience of fighting racism and of advancing the particular interests of African American unionists as means to strengthen the labor movement as a frame to approach global solidarity. Applying affirmative action principles to create the basis for a genuine equality is as necessary for unity abroad as it is at home. A foreign policy independent of U.S. government strictures is necessary too, an independence forcefully expressed by USLAW. Premised on understanding that no alternative domestic policy is possible in the U.S. without determined opposition to war, USLAW recognizes that such opposition is strengthened by building bonds with unionists from countries labeled as \"enemy.\"\n\nWhen unionism is reduced to collective bargaining, then the full human dimension of workers experiences, hopes and strivings is lost. The \"business unionism\" that prevailed for so long reproduced the manner in which capitalism divides individuals against themselves – and therefore set up a conflict between the different aspects of members' identity. From there it was a short step for too many working people to see their interests as opposed to those of workers abroad, just as it became too easy for \"worker\" interests to be seen as opposed to those of civil rights, of feminism, of environmental needs. The process of building a class conscious global labor movement reverses that direction, allowing the distinct aspects of individuals to be expressed in common movements rooted in self-awareness. In a work describing the connection between the women's movement, labor organization and international solidarity amongst banana plantation workers in Honduras, Dana Frank quotes one activist's self-description:\n\n> \"I am a unionist of the heart, completely dedicated to a cause that > because it is so deeply about social justice, compels me to a greater > and greater level of commitment ...

He was increasingly considering the idea that a just division of society's resources would have to mean breaking with the rules of capitalism, which relies on the poverty of black (and Latino) workers as an important source of super-profits due to their cheaper and more exploitable labor.As he told journalist David Halberstam in early 1968, \"For years I labored with the idea of reforming the existing institutions ofsociety, a little change here, a little change there. Now I feel quite differently. I think you've got to have a reconstruction of the entire society, a revolution of values.\"\n\nKing also began to talk about the need for socialism. In a speech delivered to his staff in 1966, he said, \"You can't talk aboutsolving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars. You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums. You're really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry... Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it reallymeans that we are saying that something is wrong... with capitalism... There must be a better distribution of wealth and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.\"\n\n[*http://www.socialistalternative.org/news/article20.php?id=1015*](http://www.socialistalternative.org/news/article20.php?id=1015)\n\n**INEQUALITY...**\n\n*From Andy Feeney:*\n\n**Sequester Cuts to \"Decimate\"Funds forPublic Defenders — Without Helping the Taxpayer**\n\nThe *Wall Street Journal's* opinion and editorial pages arerarely forumsfor \"compassionate conservativism,\"or indeed for compassionof any other kind.Butin the Opinion sectionof the Aug.21 *Journal,*one former federal judgeappointed by George W.

His article noteshow mass participation of women and nonwhite votes, along with the decimation of the white industrial working class through corporate outsourcing, hasmarkedly alteredtheshape of the electorate since the 1970s, yetwithout undermining the clout ofbig corporations.\n\nAnderson links this contemporary account with the up-and-down contest of capital vs. labor since World War II ending with a \"system-wide deadlock in the regime of accumulation\" that pervades today's politicsand economics. Thus\"The neo-liberal order has become a political no-man's land, in which no organic formula of rule is now in sight.\" What either the Democrats or the socialist leftshould do about this — assuming we want a new \"organic formula of rule\" to succeed — Anderson doesn't say.

Should labor also include statehood for the District of Columbia among its priorities?\n\nOne would almost be tempted to say \"of course not,\" except to the extent that everyone should be outraged at the notion of the United States treating the more than 600,000 residents of the national capital as colonial subjects, without voting representation in Congress or full control over its own laws and budgets. Labor has bigger things to worry about, such as its own survival, right?\n\nHowever, from time to time the District's disenfranchisement has popped onto labor's radar screen, if even at a far corner. And, I would argue, the District's achieving statehood would be a bigger boost to labor's prospects than either union members or statehood partisans may realize.\n\nIn fact, labor – both individual union members and labor organizations themselves – had a hand in the 1997 founding of the Stand Up! for Democracy in DC Coalition, also known as Free DC, the grassroots, pro-statehood organization. In July of that year Congress, ostensibly over concern for DC's financial problems but really to punish the city for re-electing Marion Barry as mayor, temporarily stripped the District of virtually all of its limited self-government, vesting all powers in the congressionally appointed Control Board. DC activists, elected officials and other citizens formed Stand Up! to challenge this assault on home rule and to re-energize the movement for full statehood. At that time, locals of AFGE, ASCME, the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and SEIU were listed on the coalition's letterhead as supporters. (Our local DSA chapter also was one of the organizational founders). Also, a number of labor organizations are listed as supporters of DC Vote, founded in 1998, a group that expresses sympathy for statehood but focuses mainly on DC voting representation in Congress. However, at no point has DC Statehood become a major focus for local labor.\n\nBut why should labor care whether DC is governed by local or federal officials? Because labor would get a fairer shake from an empowered DC government than from members of Congress acting as viceroys over a colonial possession.\n\nBig business in DC has enjoyed a cozy relationship with the District's colonial overseers that predates the home-rule years, one that left DC labor, and most DC residents, by the wayside. Harry S. Jaffe and Tom Sherwood, in their 1994 book *Dream City: Race, Power and the Decline of Washington, D.C.,* described it thus:\n\n> The white business community, represented by the Board of Trade, held > more political power than the three commissioners appointed by the > president. The businessmen simply leapfrogged the commissioners and > went to \\[John L.\\] McMillan's committee \\[the House committee that > oversaw DC\\]. Board of Trade executive director William Press would > drop by to sip cocktails and negotiate the business community's > legislation poolside at the home of ... McMillan's committee clerk.\n\nYet even in the pre-home rule years, a liberal-to-left political culture was evolving in the District that made the city more progressive than the country as a whole, and certainly more so than almost any Congress has been. It's easy to see why. First, for the past half-century, DC has been majority African American, infusing local politics with a concern for economic and social justice. In this way DC is no different from many cities across the U.S. with majority-black populations – except that those cities are parts of states where the conservatism of the suburban and rural populations dilutes the liberalism of the urban areas. Not so in wholly urban DC.\n\nAlso, a substantial portion of DC residents of all races came to the city to work for, lobby or otherwise join the orbit of the federal government. These people tended to bring with them a positive, \"can-do\" attitude toward government more consistent with liberal-to-progressive politics than with conservatism.\n\nThe District government has shown its generally pro-labor colors from time to time, such as by setting the local minimum wage one dollar per hour higher than the national level. The DC government also has been inclined to require project labor agreements (PLAs) for major city-funded projects. PLAs bring unions on board at the start of large construction projects as partners rather than adversaries. DC has used PLAs in such projects as Nationals Park and the new convention center.\n\nThe DC Council also showed its support for labor in passing the bill (still, at this writing, under consideration by Mayor Gray for signing or veto) that would require big-box stores such as Wal-Mart opening in the District to pay wages and benefits above the DC minimum wage. Also, the DC government been open to unionization among its own employees.\n\nIn its legislative oversight of DC, Congress has more frequently interfered in social issues, such as abortion or drug policy, than it has in economic or labor-related ones. One exception has been local schools. Congress, as much as from hostility to teachers unions as over concern for children's education, established the publicly funded, non-union charter schools as rivals to the traditional, unionized DC public schools.\n\nClearly, organized labor would benefit from the District operating with all the rights of a state, without Congress constantly peering over its shoulder – and some unions and their members realize this. The task now for the DC statehood movement is to convince labor to invest time, muscle and perhaps money in the effort, rather than merely their names and a handshake.\n\n[*March and Memory: Reflections on the Aug. 24, 2013 observation*](http://dsadc.org/march-and-memory-reflections-on-the-aug-24-2013-observation/)\n\nMonday, September 2nd, 2013\n\nA good spirit prevailed even in a confusing setting; that is how I would characterize the rally. We –myself, Lisa, Rosa – showed up at about 11:00 am; walking from the Foggy Bottom Metro stop to the War Memorial. Along the way we followed youth in a marching band, at the rally's edge we saw people milling around. A lot of folk were walking to the Lincoln Memorial, many others were walking the other way. We were unable to hear the speakers, of those in the crowd there were signs and petitions about police violence, but no one theme seemed to dominate – not even voting rights though clearly its suppression is a critical loss of what had been won so many years ago. We tried to hook up with some friends; that we were unable to do so was a good indicator of the size of the event. By happenstance we finally found the DSA contingent – a Bayard Rustin banner flying high. Circumstances prevented us from going with our DSA comrades to hear John Conyers. Instead, we stayed at the edge of the rally, which apparently was ending though no one seemed certain of that; lots of random conversations centered on people asking each other what was going on. Questions asked, however, without frustration; everyone we spoke to was happy just to be present.\n\nThe above might sound like a disappointed comment and indeed there is much else that could have been done. But the rally, the commemoration was valuable in and of itself; a time to gather around principles and values of love and togetherness; to reject the hatred poisoning our society's politics, our society's values. And in that, it was a true homage to the 1963 March on Washington. Most of the tributes to that march leave out the reality that different goals, different agendas brought people together – differences which were to grow in the months and years ahead, especially when some refused to speak out against the poison of war, which King and others protested. Most of the tributes paint a picture of moral benediction that leave out the racist answer to the March: the church bombing in Birmingham the Sunday following killing four children, leave out the battles and compromises ahead in a movement that won many triumphs but was not triumphant – with consequences with which we still live.\n\nYet those truths don't deny the historic importance of that March 50 years ago, a march we honored on Saturday because it stands as a reflection of how moral decency, the human urge for equality and togetherness, can forge itself as a power. And it was a truth also expressed this past 24th – the power of hope when it moves into action.\n\n*–Kurt Stand*\n\nThe demonstration was disorganized, but the diversity and numbers of people attending were awesome. Of many different banners , the most stunning to me was carried by members of the Alabama NAACP, a group that faced savage repression in the 1960s, yet kept on fighting.\n\nI was also extremely impressed by some 300 members of the Lennox Road Baptist Church (of Brooklyn), all dressed in black T-shirts proclaiming that particularly class-conscious message from the Prophet Amos, \"But let justice roll down like water, And righteousness like a mighty stream.\" Some seemed sympathetic to DSA. There likewise were countless signs, banners and T-shirts demanding justice for Trayvon Martin; showing solidarity with the march by the UAW, CWA, AFCSME, SEIU, AFT and Local 1199; and promoting other social causes.\n\nWhile other DSAers went ahead carrying signs promoting Rep. Conyers' full employment bill, H.R. 1000, a friend and I handed out the *Democratic Left*, national DSA's flyers and literature on the Conyers bill and other job-creation legislation.\n\n*– Andy Feeney*\n\nFifty years after the original march, cellphones and other devices allowed a scattered DSA contingent to collect most of its folks on a slope between the main path and the parallel boundary of the Reflecting Pool, and just inside the partial boundary of the World War II monument, one of many features of the mall that were undreamed of in 1963. And there we sat, ate, took the occasional mass selfie and chatted almost undisturbed by the faraway speakers. As it turned out, we were in a sound microclimate; only a hundred feet away closer, we were told by late-comers, the speakers could be plainly heard.\n\nAs the early afternoon waned, many of us began to make our way up to Capitol Hill for the DSA reception at Hunan Dynasty on Pennsylvania Avenue, where our local's Salons are usually hosted. We were joined by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich), who spoke about the economic conditions that lent to the need for his [*HR 1000*](http://www.johnconyers.com/hr-1000-humphrey-hawkins-full-employment-and-training-act) – a \"Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Training Act for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century\" that would apply a small transactions tax to Wall Street trades earmarked to create public service infrastructure jobs and enhanced job-training programs. The 84-year-old congressman, who began his House tenure two years after the original March, was vigorous and unbending. As he often says, the bill affirms \"the idea that the federal government can, and must, play a major role in putting Americans back to work.\"\n\n*— Woody Woodruff *\n\n[*Paid sick leave, minimum wage advocates planning round 2 in Md. legislature*](http://dsadc.org/paid-sick-leave-minimum-wage-advocates-planning-round-2-in-md-legislature/)\n\nMonday, September 2nd, 2013\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;* Labor Day 2013**\n\n*By Woody Woodruff*\n\nA well-crafted attempt to bring mandatory paid sick days for 700,000 Maryland workers not now covered was launched in both houses of the Maryland legislature last January.\n\nIt didn't fly. Neither did a bill to raise the state's minimum wage.\n\nBy the *sine die* close of the session in April, the many structural ambushes for progressive legislation built into Maryland's process had overcome the bills. Melissa Broome, a senior policy analyst at the [*Job Opportunities Task Force*](http://www.jotf.org/), echoed the hard-earned experience of many progressives in April when she blogged at the session's close \"There's a well-known understanding in our state capitol that important bills rarely – if ever – pass in the first year.\"\n\nThough legislative backers of this and other progressive measures are just emerging from summer torpor, organizations like JOTF and its coalition wing, Working Matters, are gearing up for a return engagement. A parallel campaign to raise the minimum wage in the state will also try to improve on a loss in the 2013 session.\n\nKate Planco Waybright, executive director of labor-backed Progressive Maryland, raised hopes just before Labor Day that the minimum wage effort has a shot.\n\n\"But most important is the growing momentum to raise low-income workers' wages as workers nationwide are organizing and fighting for fairness in new ways at a pace and on a scale not seen in many years,\" Waybright wrote in the organization's newsletter Aug. 29.\n\n\"[Rep. John Delaney's (MD-6) August announcement](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/delaney-pledges-to-use-personal-funds-on-campaign-to-boost-md-minimum-wage/2013/08/12/30ff70ac-037a-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html) offering to personally help finance efforts to raise Maryland's minimum wage, and [Rep. \\[Donna\\] Edwards' town hall](http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=RWkrUyZn43dl3COCwcl4fyJFn5dK8GY0) Aug. 26 pushing for raising the federal minimum wage, indicate how the labor movement and allies have raised this need higher and higher on the agenda for Congress and legislators across America.\" Gov. Martin O'Malley has suggested that the state minimum wage increase might be on his list of sponsored bills for the 2014 session, which would be his last before leaving office.\n\nA principal hurdle that stops many bills is the Fiscal Note, an economic impact statement for bills that is routinely generated in the House of Delegates Economic Matters Committee and its Senate counterpart, the Finance Committee.\n\nThe fiscal note for Del. Tom Olszewski's Earned Safe and Sick Leave bill (HB0735), which would have provided up to seven earned sick leave days per year for workers in private and public sectors not already covered by labor agreements, is a case in point. As Broome pointed out in her committee testimony, the bill would \"allow all workers to earn one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked, accruing up to a maximum of 7 full days – or 56 hours – per year. \"\n\nThe costs to employers were the main theme of the fiscal note. In addition to unspecified but direly-couched disadvantages for the state and local governments that hire part-time workers, the note found that \"it will cost Maryland employers $192 million to provide new earned sick days for employees,\" a deal-breaking lump sum. More understated was a finding by the same research unit – the Institute for Women's Policy Research – that the 24 cents per hour additional cost per employee would be nicely offset by a 25 cent per hour saving on wages \"as a result of lower turnover and reducing the spread of illnesses in the workplace.\" The committee's Business Regulation subcommittee returned an unfavorable report, adopted by the full committee.\n\nPublic benefits are seldom on the radar in most fiscal notes. This structural business-biased ambush, plus hostile (and inaccurate) observations from Republican members of the committee, brought the bill's unfavorable report in mid-March and its withdrawal in the House by prime sponsor – and Economic Matters member – Olszewski, a Baltimore County Democrat. Though Democrats had a substantial majority on Economic Matters, few had sprung to the bill's defense during the lengthy hearing. The standard mantra that even a good bill must fail in two sessions before passing on a third attempt appeared to be in force.\n\nBroome's blog post reflected eagerness to relaunch the effort, which was bolstered in its House and Senate hearings by testimony and turnout from mostly Baltimore-based labor and alt-labor organizations. \"It is well established,\" Broome's committee testimony said,\" that lack of access to paid sick days disproportionately affects low-wage and service industry workers. Of workers with annual earnings of less than $24,999, 69% are unable to take a day off when they or their family members are sick. Less than one quarter of food service workers have access to paid sick days.\"\n\nThe public health benefit realized because food service workers would have an alternative to coming to work when sick was not addressed in the fiscal note. But it's a clear plus for the bill, as emphasized in a [*Baltimore Sun op-ed by a food service worker*](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-08-06/news/bs-ed-restaurant-workers-20130806_1_food-workers-paid-sick-days-many-restaurant-workers) in August.\n\nQuestioned about the next steps for the bill, Del. Olszewski said in an email \"I am looking forward to re-introducing the initiative next session as lead sponsor. I plan to reshape the bill to overcome objections from last year, and am thankful for the meaningful conversation and lively debate that took place over the bill last session and since. With input from other legislators, advocates and opposition we are busy crafting a comprehensive piece of legislation, learning from the experience last year. This is a strong bill that is needed now, more than ever- Maryland families are struggling to make tough decisions between their health and the well-being of their families.\"\n\nAnother plus for the bill is a growing group of state and local governments that have enacted, or are debating, paid sick leave. Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Portland, Ore. and (below) most recently New York City have all passed bills.\n\nIn New Jersey, where 1.2 million workers are without paid sick leave, women legislators are taking the lead on a bill similar to the Maryland effort. New Jersey workers could earn up to 7 paid sick days a year (5 days if a workplace has fewer than 20 employees). \"While some corporate interests might say otherwise, the fact of the matter is that earned sick days are good for New Jersey's businesses,\" said Lizette Delgado Polanco, executive director of the SEIU New Jersey State Council. She was quoted on the aggregator site newjerseynewsroom.com, where she continued \"The health of our economy depends on the health of our working families – and the health of our working families depends on this legislation.\"\n\nNew York City's Council passed paid sick leave this summer, sort of, but the peculiar politics of the city and its current sizzling mayoral race have kept it hostage. It is supported by a veto-proof majority of the Council, according to [*The New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/nyregion/steinem-pressures-quinn-on-council-vote-on-sick-leave-bill.html?_r=0), but was being delayed legislatively by Council president Christine Quinn, who is a mayoral candidate. According to the legal-affairs website Mondaq the bill was passed over the Mayor's veto June 26, with last-minute provisions tightening the definition of \"family member\" and delaying implementation if the city's economy declines in the meantime. (This is the city with Wall Street, we recall...)\n\nNew York may be a big boost for other efforts. [*A Washington Post article*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-leadership/wp/2013/06/27/new-york-passes-paid-sick-leave-law-but-u-s-still-far-behind/) quoted Deborah Ness of the National Partnership for Women and Families on the New York City vote: \"It's a huge pivotal step for the country,\" she says. \"I believe that if we can show that it works in New York City, it just reinforces that you can make it work anywhere.\"\n\nA paid sick leave law appears to defy the business community's expectations in Connecticut, one of the nation's wealthiest states and the first one to pass a bill, in 2011. It was limited in scope, covering only enterprises with 50 or more workers and many loopholes – chain restaurants, for instance, could count each outlet as a separate entity and slip under the 50-head limit. Still, the New York Times was able to [*find some grumpy small businessmen*](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/business/smallbusiness/paid-sick-leave-laws-generate-more-concern-than-pain.html?pagewanted=all) but no labor or other advocates on the side of paid sick leave.\n\nIt took [*The Wall Street Journal *](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323864304578318530400767940.html)to find a fan in Connecticut's Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy, who said after nearly two years' experience with the bill – in the midst of this spring's tough flu season – he has talked with a variety of employers statewide who \"now admit it really wasn't that big of a deal.\" He added \"A lot of the early criticism about how this would be abused just hasn't turned out to be the fact,\"\n\nMassachusetts activists under the banner Raise Up Massachusetts are [*launching a complex campaign*](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/08/08/2433531/massachusetts-paid-sick-leave/) to put both a $10.50 minimum wage increase and paid sick leave on an initiative ballot.\n\nIn Maryland the messages are not getting mixed, for good or ill. [*Raise Maryland*](http://raisemd.org/) announces it will again pursue a minimum wage increase bill for the state (last year's, killed in committee also, would have raised it from $7.25 to $10 per hour by 2015, then index it to inflation). Many of the organizations in support of paid sick leave, including unions, are also supporting the minimum wage increase. But the lead sponsors may be different. One of the lead sponsors for a minimum wage hike from last year, Del. Alicia Braveboy of Prince George's, will probably be sidetracked this year by her campaign for state Attorney General. The other lead sponsor, Montgomery County Sen. Rob Garagiola, has announced his resignation from his seat after losing a primary battle for the Democratic nomination for the 6<sup>th</sup> Dist. Congressional nomination, a seat eventually won by Democrat Delaney, above – who now has pledged money and activity on behalf of the state bill.\n\nSome of the hopeful signs in other cities and states have to be balanced against a [*campaign to forbid paid sick leave and minimum wage laws*](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/08/20/2491931/north-carolina-may-throw-a-wrench-into-paid-sick-leave/) being legislated in or within states – led, no surprise, by the American Legislative Exchange Council, the unspeakable Koch-funded ALEC. North Carolina appears to be next.\n\nMaryland, not a state particularly vulnerable to the ALEC virus, nevertheless has a strong pro-business bias built into legislative procedures, and these will require mobilization to overcome. Most of the action came from Baltimore organizations and individuals in the 2013 session, and the DC suburbs of the Free State will need to step up in advance of next January.","order":3},{"title":"SOCIALIST TAKES AND TAKEAWAYS","date":"2013-09-02","issue":"September 2013","author":"","body":"**TELL MAYOR GRAY: SIGN LARGE RETAILER BILL**\n\nDC Mayor Vince Gray remains on the fence as to whether he will sign or veto the Large Retailer Accountability Act, passed by the District Council last month, that would require newly established big-box stores in DC to pay its employees at least $12.50 an hour.

Bezos' business focus channels Steve Jobs in theory and style. Writers claim that he is focused on customer service, a long-term view of business, and inventing and reinventing business models.\n\nHis style is often as sharp and confrontational as Jobs's was, and Amazon is hardly friendly to unions. He has had difficultywith unions in Germany, and in Pennsylvania Amazon workers were not happy to bust their butts in 100-degree heat. His Pennsylvania warehouse did get air conditioning after a local paper ran an article on the debacle. Somehow posting an ambulance outside the warehouse was not seen as a sufficient response to the heat. The *Washington Post's* union has sent him a welcoming letter and we can only hope that he and the workers can work together to invent the future<span id=\"_msoanchor_2\" class=\"anchor\"></span>.\n\nBy permission: [*http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/1884.html*](http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/1884.html)\n\nA big plus is that Bezos is a serious businessman who plans and executes for the long term like many other West Coast businesses as compared with Wall Street firms running amok on an obsession with quarterly profits. He is criticized by other businesses for not raising profits. A serious analyst would approve of plowing profits into the growth of an operation and reinventing work processes<span id=\"_msoanchor_3\" class=\"anchor\"></span>. This tactic firmly establishes and expands your business. Minimizing one's initial profits could be seen as avoiding the eating of your seed corn just for the sake of greed.\n\nBezos' political behavior has been inconsistent and possibly business-linked. Amy Goodman said on \"Democracy Now\" Aug. 7 that \"Critics of the sale \\[of the Post\\] have cited Bezos's close ties to the U.S. government. In 2010, Amazon pulled the plug on hosting the WikiLeaks website under heavy political pressure. Earlier this year, Amazon inked a $600 million cloud-computing deal with the CIA.\"\n\nBezos has acted positively, from a progressive point of view, on one issue. When a former employee asked him to donate $100,000 to the gay marriage issue, being contested electorally in Washington state, he and his wife donated $2.5 million. Most major corporations are often more focused on hiring the best people than on fretting about who the employees sleep with or marry.\n\n*— Daniel Adkins*\n\n\n\n*Editor's note: a complementary take on Bezos by Andy Feeney is elsewhere in this issue.*\n\nBooks: ***Distorting the Truthto Savethe Market:* How a Handful of Brilliant ScientistsMuddiedPublic Debate On Issues Ranging from Tobacco Smoke to Climate Change**\n\nWhen rightwing champions of the oil industry, like Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, want to portray the problem of global climate change as a \"hoax\" or a \"liberal myth,\" some turn to fundamentalist Christianity or simple anti-intellectualismin hopes ofdiscreditingthe overwhelming agreementamong climate scientistsaboutthe perils of \"greenhouse\" gas emissions, most notably of CO2 and methane.\n\nYet cooperating with Inhofe and other know-nothing foesof mainstream climate science are a handful of seemingly respectable researchers, some of whom have achieved high honors in their respective fields. Why havescientists of this caliber joined in whatenvironment activists often call \"global warming denialism\"? And how seriously should we take their objections to the alleged \"consensus\" on climate change touted by Al Gore, James Hansen and other climate activists?\n\nIn their book *Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming*, historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway trace the \"denialism' of high-ranking climate contrarians to the Cold War struggle against Communism in the 1950s, and to the libertarian zeal of some Cold War scientific warriors whoapparently concluded in the 1950s that merely attempting to regulate corporate pollution and corporate misbehaviorwould threatencapitalism and strengthen the forces for Communism of the most totalitarian kind.\n\nOne of the most vehement skeptics about climate change, former atomic physicist Fred Seitz, is a former president of the National Academy of Sciences; however, Seitz also directed a program for R.J. Reynolds in the early 1980s that sought to generate scientific evidence in defense of tobacco smoking. Another prominent greenhouse contrarian, Fred Singer, coauthored a report in the 1990s attacking the EPA for attempting to address the health risks of second-hand smoke.\n\nIn *Merchants of Doubt*, (paper, Bloomsbury Press 2011) Oreskes and Conway note that these and a handful of otherscientists, some of them extremely prominent innational securitycircles in the 1950s, at least a few of them Eastern European refugees, have not only cooperated in defending the tobacco industry from regulation over the years.At various times they have also denounced the now widely accepted finding that chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs are damaging to the ozone layer.\n\nThrough corporate-backedconservative think tanks such as the George Marshall Institute, they likewise have rallied in support of Ronald Reagan's proposed \"Star Wars\" program, or Strategic Defense Initiative, while the majority of scientists were concluding that it was unworkable. Some also attacked the late Carl Sagan for associating the likely consequences of nuclear war with \"nuclear winter,\" and recently a few have tried to denounce environmental writer Rachel Carson, author*Silent Spring*, for initially pointing out waht are now quitewell-documented risks with DDT and other pesticides.\n\nIn *Merchants of Doubt,* Oreskes and Conway point to many examples of these contrarian scientists accepting large financial contributions from the polluting industries they were defending, suggesting their public statements have been far from disinterested. But the book makes it clear that their strong anti-Communism and their basically libertarianopposition to governmentcontrols over business as a likely \"road to serfdom\" have been at least as crucial asthe financial rewards in inspiring their attacks on mainstream science. Democratic socialists and environmentalists would do well to read this account of how loyalty to rightwing economic ideology has swayed the scientific views of some otherwise brilliant individuals, many of whom really should have known better.\n\nFor more information on *Merchants of Doubt* and the ideas it explores, click on the web site [*http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/*](http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/).

Byerly","body":"News of Comcast's failed attempt to take over Time Warner Cable on April 24 is being cheered across the land by telecom consumers who saw nothing but rising prices and worsening service if the deal had been approved by the [*Federal Communications Commission*](http://www.fcc.gov). Comcast dropped its $45.2 billion bid for TWC after growing public opposition and increased scrutiny of its effects by the FCC.\n\nFCC Chairman [*Tom Wheeler said*](http://www.fcc.gov/transaction/comcast-twc) that Comcast's decision to drop its bid was \"in the best interests of consumers,\" in that a merger between the Comcast and TWC would have created a company that dominated in the number of broadband and video subscribers, as well as programming options. Wheeler added, \"The proposed merger would have posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation especially given the growing importance of high-speed broadband to online video and innovative new services.\" Wheeler attributed Comcast's decision to the \"good working relationship\" that had developed between Comcast officials and FCC staff.\n\nBut media activists can stand up and take credit for this one. The backstory that must be told if this historic outcome is to be understood is how well-orchestrated advocacy and public information campaigns mobilized an ever-wider network of people opposed to monopolistic tendencies in the telecom industries. Not unlike the pro-Net Neutrality decision that the FCC made a few weeks earlier, the death of the Comcast-TWC merger is the result of progressive groups and individuals in the media reform and media justice movements who articulated a clear analysis of the problem, made it relevant to ordinary folks (who already saw the reality in their escalating monthly bills from Comcast and the other cable and Internet providers), and emphasized the importance of telling the FCC not to approve the merger.\n\nNote for instance the two leading groups' messages. [*Free Press*](http://www.freepress.net), the DC-based group instigated by [*Bob McChesney*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_W._McChesney) and [*John Nichols*](http://www.thenation.com/authors/john-nichols) in 2003, kept a daily barrage of anti Comcast-TWC merger messages going out by email and through their lobbyists on the Hill from the moment Comcast filed its application in January 2013. The group acknowledges that defeat of the merger plan was the work of \"[*a large coalition*](http://www.freepress.net/blog/2015/04/24/people-power-beats-back-comcast-time-warner-cable-merger) of organizations that pushed to stop Comcast – so many groups that we can't list them all here.\" They include more leftist orientated groups like [*Center for Media Reform*](http://centerformediajustice.org/about/), based in Oakland, CA. The Center was an important player with its grassroots education and organizing efforts, particularly in communities of color. The Center has always understood more democratic media policy as a route toward \"[*fundamental communication rights*](http://centerformediajustice.org/about/our-story/our-vision/)\" and \"universal media and technology access,\" in the struggle for racial justice and human rights.\n\nLess obvious are the academic activists who weighed in with data and other research, entered through official comments to the FCC and in wider circles. Most prominent among them is the Georgetown Law Center's [*Institute for Public Representation*](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/clinical-programs/our-clinics/ipr/index.cfm) whose team of lawyers has crafted the essential [*legal arguments against media concentration and deregulation*](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/clinical-programs/our-clinics/IPR/Media-Projects.cfm) for more than a dozen years. It was the IPR that worked hand-in-hand with lawyers from the now-folded [*Media Access Project*](http://www.adweek.com/news/television/media-access-project-fold-139376) that represented public interest groups in what became the [**Prometheus Radio Project vs. FCC**](http://www.prometheusradio.org/prp_vs_the_fcc) rulings in 2004 and 2011. Those rulings blocked further de-regulation and required the FCC to revisit the matter of women and minority broadcast ownership, among other things – the latter (ownership) being something the FCC has refused to respond to even to the present time.\n\nAlso involved in building a base of opposition to the Comcast-TWC merger have been members of the [*Howard Media Group*](http://www.howardmediagroup.org/), a student-faculty collaborative at Howard University,\\* that uses research to advance the communication rights of African Americans, women and other under-served groups. In its comment of [*March 2014 to the FCC*](http://www.howardmediagroup.org/news/comcast-time-warner-cable-mega-merger-dead), HMG members took the position that this merger \"poses a threat to freedom of speech by imposing financial barriers to disadvantaged with needs to connect for vital education and communication services.\"\n\nAt the same time as the public becomes increasingly aware of the threat that huge media companies pose to their communication rights, there is the reminder of how tenuous these recent gains of a pro-Net Neutrality policy and a failed Comcast-TWC merger really are. If a Republican president is elected in November 2016, the FCC membership will tilt to Republican leadership as three of the five commissioners, including the chairman, will reflect the party in power. Should that happen, the newly activated citizens and the activist advocates who helped to get them conscientized and mobilized will all lose power and policy ground.\n\nThere is also a global dimension to consider. The horizontally and vertically integrated telecommunications industry is second only to the pharmaceutical industry in revenues worldwide, giving their CEOs and shareholders enormous political and economic power. An additional fact is that most of the largest conglomerated telecom companies are located in the United States, making them the standard bearers and primary voices of US-style capitalism. In this writer's view, there has never been a better time for democratic socialists to grasp the issues telecom policy raises and to forge a strategy for intervention that would serve the common good within our own national borders and beyond them.\n\n*\\*Editor's Note: Metro DC DSA member Carolyn Byerly, currently chair of Howard's Department of Communication, Culture and Media Studies, has been an active member of the Howard Media Group.*","order":0},{"title":"Even Battling A GOP Governor, MD Legislators Can't Get Untangled From Business Interests","date":"2015-04-30","issue":"May 2015","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"It was billed as a battle between a newly elected Republican governor and a deep-blue Democratic legislative branch, but when the tumult and the shouting was done, the Maryland General Assembly demonstrated just how deeply business interests control the levers of power among Democrats as well. Major progressive efforts failed in the established death traps of the House Economic Matters and Senate Finance committees, both stacked with pro-business members.\n\n[*The legislative roundup from the (quite unprogressive) Annapolis Capital April 18*](http://www.capitalgazette.com/opinion/our_say/ph-ac-ce-our-say-20150419,0,442677.story) said with satisfaction \"\\[Republican Gov. Larry Hogan\\] got much of what he wanted out of this session.\" Their editorial notes that the budget contained no tax increases. Hogan's bullying tirades on that trusty Reaganite issue had an effect during the campaign that lingered into the session. But the budget outcome is conditioned by the fact that the strong-executive Maryland system requires the assembly to appropriate no more than the governor's budget proposes. Their only wiggle room is the possibility of moving money around under that ceiling. That, they did. Part of that strategy can include new tax revenues to cover vulnerable areas that lose money in the shell game of fund-shifting. Rebecca Lessner in *Maryland Reporter* [*outlined*](http://marylandreporter.com/2015/04/21/maryland-legislature-considered-many-tax-increases/) the tax-raising schemes, all of which apparently failed because of the scare-mythology that Hogan won the election on his mantra that taxes were too high. (In fact, most Democratic ops will argue, the Anthony Brown campaign was a botch from the start).\n\nTaxes on chicken produced on the Eastern Shore (to support keeping chicken manure out of the Chesapeake Bay); on plastic bags and bottles to keep them in the waste stream instead of cluttering the landscape; and on tobacco all failed in committee. Repeal of the stormwater remediation fee, which Hogan demonized by calling it the \"rain tax,\" was passed with provisos that will actually weigh more heavily on the large counties. They will no longer be required to raise the money for stormwater remediation through a real estate tax. But they will have to report in detail about how they are remediating, and how they are paying for it. And their direct mandate from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to clean up their runoff before it gets to the Bay is not changed. The law, which was supposed to give local governments the cover of a state mandate for added fees, now leaves them vulnerable to their own dissatisfied taxpayers.\n\nThe budget machinations: the legislature was working from a plan that had already been deeply trimmed after their last session because revenues fell short. The [*after-session report*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/Pubs/legislegal/2015rs-90-day-report.pdf) by the Department of Legislative Services noted nearly $300 million in cutbacks by former Gov. Martin O'Malley, including across-the-board agency cuts and painful trims in state higher education and aid to local governments. Hogan's proposed cuts compounded the pain and brought a rebellion from the Assembly that was at first bipartisan. $200 million in restored spending on K-12 education, employee compensation and several other categories remains in dispute; Hogan can't use it for its original purpose but doesn't have to spend it either. As part of his proposed cuts, Hogan had pursued his cheap-shot campaign against state employees by taking back a 2 percent cost-of-living raise already in effect. The legislators passed a bill forbidding Hogan's gambit in future.\n\nThe 2014-15 surge of public awareness on police misconduct and killings, especially of black men, brought a positive batch of laws that passed in their first attempt. The *WaPo* wrapup:\n\n\"\\[Democratic Sen. Jamie\\] Raskin said that justice reform drew bipartisan support, especially as Republicans realized that the state could save money — and create the possibility of having more taxpayers — by incarcerating fewer people. 'We've gotten past the obsolete discussion over tough-on-crime, and we've entered the much more fruitful discussion of smart-on-crime,' he said. ... Sen. Joanne C. Benson (D-Prince George's) said the national focus on Ferguson was one reason that bills about incarceration and law enforcement — many of which were embraced by the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland — seemed to have more success this year.\"\n\nA bill to shield nonviolent misdemeanors (some of them) from criminal records was aimed at making it easier to get jobs. Ex-offenders on probation or parole will be able to gain the vote. The [*Job Opportunity Task Force/Working Matters*](http://www.jotf.org/) in Baltimore, a persistent campaigner, reported \"After four years, the [*Maryland Second Chance Act*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?id=hb0244&stab=01&pid=billpage&tab=subject3&ys=2015RS) finally won approval from lawmakers, opening access to jobs and housing for more than 200,000 people in our state. This, coupled with the last-minute repeal of a statute that prohibits expungement of a record if a person is subsequently convicted of another crime, is great news for the one in three adults dealing with the lasting impact of a criminal record.\"\n\nCertainly bills requiring officers to wear body cameras got big bipartisan margins, including a 47-0 vote in the senate. And the *WaPo* also noted that \"There was a bill approved that would require a statewide accounting of civilian deaths at the hands of police officers, and another that sets policies for how police departments should use body cameras.\"\n\nFrom Nate Rabner, [*Capital News Service*](http://marylandreporter.com/2015/04/23/police-conduct-drug-crime-sentencing-focus-of-general-assemblys-proposed-reforms/): \"Del.

Larry Hogan, a Republican, will sign the reporting bill, spokeswoman Erin Montgomery said.\"\n\nRabner of CNS reported that two bills sought by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake \"died in committee.\" One would have put a new \"misconduct in office\" statute on the books essentially increasing an officer's liability to long jail time for a conviction on misconduct.\n\nThe CNS report said \"Restorative justice and police accountability were dominant themes this session\" and quoted Sen. Bobby Zirkin, a Baltimore County Democrat, saying that the drug policy reforms were a transition away from the \"(President Ronald) Reagan kind of war on drugs, tough-on-crime approach to drug use\" toward \"targeting the education and targeting treatment and doing those things which actually work.\"\n\nJOTF/Working Matters's other priority didn't fare as well. \"Unfortunately, the [*Maryland Campaign for Paid Sick Days*](http://paidsickdaysmd.org/) was not as successful this year as lawmakers once again declined to act on the [*Healthy Working Families Act*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?id=sb0040&stab=01&pid=billpage&tab=subject3&ys=2015RS).\" This bill, for the third year in a row, failed in the House Economic Matters Committee. JOTF continued: \"We recently [*received instruction*](http://thedailyrecord.com/2015/04/06/session-over-for-paid-sick-days/) to work with opponents during the interim as legislative leaders are committed to seriously considering this law in 2016.\" An interesting development: environmental organizations have been slowly expanding their issue arrays to include public health, which they see as part and parcel of environmental justice. The Chesapeake Climate Action Network, among others, included the earned sick leave bill among their priorities and lamented its failure.\n\nCCAN had a mixed bag of environmental hopes itself. In [*the organization's session wrap-up*](http://chesapeakeclimate.org/blog/annapolis-wrap-up-what-happened-in-the-maryland-2015-legislative-session/) the top news was a virtual three-year ban on fracking in the Marcellus Shale of Western Maryland, while regulations promulgated by Gov. O'Malley were studied for effectiveness. A bill that would have declared fracking processes too hazardous to be protected as trade secrets (including the toxic chemical compounds found in waste water) failed, however. A bill to study the hazards of oil transported by rail – cause of major fires and spills in the last year elsewhere – also failed. Most importantly, a bill to strengthen climate change goals in the \"renewable portfolio\" – the percent of renewable energy power companies must use by 2020 – failed in its first try. It's an issue that bears strongly on the question of Exelon Corp's takeover of Pepco and almost certainly reflects heavy corporate lobbying – Exelon is a [*nuke-heavy and renewables-averse company.*](http://dsadc.org/pepco-exelon-deal-provides-focus-to-feb-15-general-meeting/)\n\nBut another pro-environment bill that would also affect Exelon did pass – a pilot program to ease community solar power applications. In CCAN's description, the bill \"will set up a process for groups of Marylanders (i.e. not just individual homeowners) to split the credits for electricity generated by a shared solar installation. This will introduce a new model to Maryland that gives renters and low- and moderate-income residents access to the benefits of solar energy.\"\n\nA batch of bills proposed by the [*Augustine Commission*](http://dsadc.org/maryland-a-pro-worker-vision-of-the-future-hijacked-by-the-neoliberal-agenda-sort-of/) were passed by the legislators, and some may be Trojan-horse bills that could give business interests even greater influence in the halls of Maryland government, if that's possible. The one with the most potential for mischief sets up an Advisory Council on the Impact of Regulations on Small Businesses that can call a hearing at any time a bill seems to threaten a \"significant adverse impact on small businesses.\" This could be another hurdle for any progressive, pro-worker legislation. For instance the \"fiscal note\" attached to this year's version of the ill-fated bill providing earned sick leave states that it will have a \"significant adverse impact\" on business.\n\nBills that survived the legislature [*still must get Gov. Larry Hogan's*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/here-are-some-of-the-maryland-bills-awaiting-gov-larry-hogans-signature/2015/04/14/00a461f0-e2a9-11e4-81ea-0649268f729e_story.html) signature – a potentially fraught process given the strained relations between Hogan and the legislators, and one that might bring the assembly members back for veto override sessions. Hogan said Apr. 24 – in the midst of considerable unrest at a death in Baltimore police custody — that he would sign a group of bills strengthening oversight of police. Significant progressive successes like the moratorium on fracking are still on the edge. And the $200 million in dispute – which Hogan can spend (or refuse to spend) on K-12 education, reinstating state workers COL raise and other items – will likely be a focus of wrangling between sessions.\n\nIt's easy for legislators to strike a posture extolling a progressive bill and then vote against it in committee or subcommittee, where votes are often not recorded. On the rare occasions that veto overrides come up, legislators can cave to pressure and horse-trading offers. In those nooks and crannies of the legislative process, businessmen and their campaign contributions still rule the roost.","order":1},{"title":"Good Reads for Socialists","date":"2015-04-30","issue":"May 2015","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"Nudging US workers and consumers out of their apathetic acceptance of late-capitalist social and economic conditions is a big task for DSAers and our allies.

To explore the thinking of a pathbreaking leftwing intellectual who made his reputation trying to explicate and unravel those same six decades' worth of political change in a relatively brief film treatment is Quixotic as well. Yet the attempt to do so can be emotionally powerful and the images involved hypnotic, and I think that description fits John Akomfrah's film *The Stuart Hall Project,* which about 15 DSA members and supporters viewed in mid-April at a special showing arranged by DSA's Carolyn Byerly at the Howard University Department of Communications, Culture and Media Studies.\n\nMy subjective sense of the movie is that it was an enormously powerful evocation of the many overlapping political events and political crises that shaped the evolution of the so-called New Left in Britain as well as elsewhere from the 1950s through about 1999, and as a leftist who tried to keep up with the events of this era I found it thought-provoking and at times almost overwhelming in the complex issues it raises for the democratic left. Whether this or any other film treatment of a similar length could possibly begin to explore the political and intellectual contributions Stuart Hall made over the course of a long career is a different question, of course. And I wonder if the film's visual references to a number of pivotal social and political developments of the 1956-1990 period will be understandable to younger socialists (and other younger viewers, especially outside the UK and the Caribbean diaspora) who have not lived through the same stretch of history.\n\nWhat the film does superlatively well, I think, is give us a provocative introduction to the life and ideas of a pivotal New Left thinker, and an impetus to go study his major contributions on our own. Whether we take up the challenge is at the option of the individual viewer. At least as I understand Stuart Hall's contribution to communications theory – which is not much, I confess – this aspect of the film may not be an accident. One of Hall's major contributions to communications research was the concept that communication is never a simple or one-way affair, but one involving the \"coding\" and \"decoding\" of what is said by the speaker and the intended audience. Those being spoken to bring their own cultural understandings to what the communicator is trying to convey, and their \"decoding\" of what has been coded may be conventional or unconventional, welcoming or antagonistic, a fact that militates against simplistic understandings of the entire process. What DSA members and other progressive audiences get out of the *Stuart Hall Project,* therefore, may depend as much on how we \"decode\" it as on what Akomfrah or Hall himself intended to say.\n\nAs the film portrays Hall, he was concerned throughout his career, and well before it, by questions of race, immigration and cultural identify, and for good reason. A Jamaican-born intellectual who made his political and professional mark in Britain, Hall was born into an upwardly striving family of mixed racial background, with his lighter-skinned mother being acutely aware of colonial Jamaica's finely graduated status system based in large part on skin color. Hall happened to be darker-skinned than anyone else in his immediate family, and one of his sisters encountered vehement disapproval from their mother when she fell in love with a much darker-skinned doctor on the island. Ultimately she suffered a nervous breakdown over the family conflict arising from the affair and underwent electroshock therapy that left her permanently somewhat impaired.\n\nAs a relatively young man, Hall sought to escape from the racial hierarchies of Jamaica by traveling to the UK to study at Oxford, where he worked on a Ph.D. thesis on the novelist Henry James and hoped, initially, for a professional career with the British academic elite. But he encountered enough racial prejudice at Oxford that he soon gravitated to involvement outside of academia with the local immigrant West Indian community, which was largely working class. This experience drew him into the orbit of the British left.\n\nThen in 1956, the film indicates, Hall was appalled by two parallel events showing abuses of political and military power: the crushing of an attempted Hungarian Revolution by Russian tanks, on the one hand, and the British government's involvement in a neo-colonialist military attack on Gen. Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt, on the other, in a war over Nasser's nationalization of the previously British-controlled Suez Canal. Along with several former members of the British Communist Party, who quit the party in protest over the Russian intervention in Hungary, Hall began to argue for the creation of a British \"new left,\" essentially dedicated to democratic socialism, which would spurn both Soviet foreign policy and Soviet authoritarianism, on the one hand, and the capitalist imperialism practiced by supposedly \"democratic\" governments like Britain's, on the other.\n\nBy 1960, Hall became the first editor of the *New Left Review,* a publication whose contributors included such then- prominent British radicals as E.P. Thompson, Raymond Williams, Ralph Miliband and Doris Lessing. He also soon became a voice for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), an organization that mobilized leftists, pacifists and other disaffected Britons in protests and acts of non-violent civil disobedience aimed at preventing the UK from acquiring nuclear weapons or allowing US nuclear weapons to be deployed on British soil.\n\nThrough the CND, Hall met his future wife, a white Englishwoman, and the two soon were married. But when Hall and his wife Catherine moved to Birmingham, where Hall took a leading role in the newly created Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at Birmingham University, the two encountered open racist hostility when they appeared together in the streets. Within a relatively few years, they began to raise their mixed-race children, in an era when a growing white backlash against nonwhite immigration was fueling the reemergence of an openly neo-fascist movement in the UK. Yet when Hall went back to Jamaica on a visit to see his family, he would find his own mother expressing anxiety and disgust about \"her\" England being overrun by nonwhite immigrants – nonwhite immigrants who in some cases looked very similar to Hall.\n\nOne important theme that Akomfrah's film traces throughout Hall's career, accordingly, is that of his feeling out of place both in Jamaica and in Britain, and by extension feeling like something of a stranger everywhere. Over the years, the film suggests, Hall came to feel that his feelings of cultural estrangement were common to a growing number of people around the world, who were incapable of feeling truly at \"home\" and rooted as large majorities of people had traditionally felt in the past.\n\nHowever, the film's imagery and its cross-cutting references to Hall's writings and speeches indicate that the problems of race, immigrant status and culture were hardly the only influences that shaped Hall's intellectual and political development over the years. The film includes images and historical footage of other events outside of the UK that also engaged Hall and other members of the New Left – the 1959 Cuban Revolution and the subsequent U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of the island, for example; the Soviet-backed erection of the Berlin Wall blocking access to non-Communist West Berlin from the Communist East Berlin sector; the 1960 Sharpeville massacre in South Africa; British attempts at suppressing anti-colonial independence movements in Ghana and Kenya, and the growing U.S. military engagement in the Vietnam War.\n\nBack in England itself, the film shows Hall trying to apply his studies on popular culture to understanding the sometimes violent cultural conflicts of middle-class \"Mods\" and working-class \"Rockers\" over the music and clothing fashions of the early 1960s. Meanwhile a general revulsion against the US role in Vietnam inspired a growing number of protests by young people throughout the UK and Western Europe, and in 1968 the left and the culture at large were rocked by a series of shocks – the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in the US, the Soviet military intervention to block the creation of \"socialism with a human face\" in Czechoslovakia, and the near-revolution that disaffected French university students and large numbers of French workers nearly achieved in Paris that year.\n\nIn evoking the political challenges of the 1970s, the film touches on the 1970 election in Chile that put Socialist Party leader Salvador Allende in the presidency, only to be overthrown in 1973 in a brutal military coup which had unofficial backing from the US intelligence services under the Nixon administration. The film also alludes briefly to the Notting Hill race riots of 1977 in London and notes to coming to power of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan as the Seventies ended and the Eighties began. Also raising new issues and new problems for the left, the film indicates, was the 1979 Iranian revolution and the Ayatollah Khomeini's launching of the Islamic Republic of Iran – an event that called into question the traditional leftist commitment to a politics of universalism and internationalism.\n\nFor me, anyway, John Akomfrah's footage evokes all of these unsettling historical events and suggests some of the insights that Hall brought to them. But the quotes from Hall's lectures and BBC presentations are necessarily brief, and it's hard to tell from the context exactly what Hall believed the British left and the British public as a whole should learn from them.\n\nWhat is clear from the footage is that Hall remained committed to the validity of the West Indian immigrant experience to the end of his life, and that his marriage with Catherine survived the explosive emergence of the feminist movement on the left in the late 1960s, although Hall apparently found Catherine's new militancy unsettling at first. By the end of his life, the film suggests, Hall had concluded that the feminist movement, by placing traditional Christian sexual roles in question, also had opened up cultural and political space for a much freer exploration of sexual options, including by the LGBT movement.\n\nIn terms of other influences that Hall had on the British left and the international left, I think this film is not very informative. A quick glance at Hall's Wikipedia entry and at some of the obituaries published following his death in 2013 shows other sides of Hall's influence that are only hinted at in the film. For example, a series of obituary essays in the *Guardian* suggests that Hall not only was considered the \"godfather of multiculturalism\" by some commentators, but also a theorist of a revised approach to Labour Party politics that eventually produced such leaders as Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair. At least one of the *Guardian* obituary writers adds that by the end of his life, Hall was rather critical of the \"New Labour\" party that Blair came to symbolize: it now longer seemed to stand for anything, the *Guardian* cites Hall as complaining, with the implication being that it now has little real chance of competing successfully against the Conservatives.\n\nA 1985 critique of Hall and some other prominent British leftists by a Trotskyist writer named Alex Callinocos, writing in the *International Socialist*, identifies Hall along with the noted Communist historian Eric Hobsbawm as promoting a so-called Eurocommunist politics within the British left, as opposed to a more traditional Marxist approach that had stressed labor militancy on the part of a largely male-led industrial working class and the unions serving it. In contributions to the Communist Party of Great Britain's surprisingly lively and diverse journal *Marxism Today,* Callinocos says, Hall developed a theoretical basis for a more diverse and less openly \"socialist\" approach to leftwing politics through his analysis of \"Thatcherism\" as he and other *Marxism Today* contributors characterized it.\n\nThatcherism, in Hall's view, represented a form of \"authoritarian populism\" with real appeal to some sectors of the British working class, and combined a traditional Conservative or Tory party emphasis on the defense of traditional institutions – including the family and the State – with a \"neoliberal\" enthusiasm for pure, unregulated \"free market\" capitalism, of a kind that many Conservative leaders from Disraeli through Winston Churchill had basically rejected. By drawing on popular frustrations with bureaucracy, nonwhite immigration and the mistakes of previous Labour governments, Hall reportedly thought, Thatcher had created a new political synthesis in British life, a movement dedicated to \"free markets and a strong State.\" In some ways Hall thought this represented a politics of rightwing \"exceptionalism\" analogous to the \"exceptionalist\" politics of fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s. Hall along with Hobsbawm recognized important differences between Thatcherism and fascism, the Callinocos article indicates. But seeing Thatcher's authoritarian populism as both extremely dangerous and likely to promote a rightward shift in British politics for years to come, they advocated that the left abandon traditional class-struggle politics in the Marxist style and turn instead to creating a \"broad democratic alliance\" somewhat analogous to the anti-Nazi \"popular front\" politics that Communist Parties around the globe practiced in the 1930s before the 1939 signing of the Hitler-Stalin pact.\n\nFrom the perspective that Callinocos expressed in 1985, in other words, Hall can be seen as the formulator of a broadly democratic, Gramsci-style politics that essentially turned the British far left away from its revolutionary and working-class roots and towards the basically empty politics of New Labour under Tony Blair. Yet from the perspective of others with more admiration for Hall's politics, his analysis was one that helped to free the left from an outdated and stale kind of working-class militancy that is being rendered obsolete both by the decline of the traditional industrial working class, with its base in heavy industry, and by the emergence of new political movements on the left ranging from feminism and pacifism to the ongoing struggle for immigrant rights and against white racism. For admirers of Hall, it seems, the best way to \"decode\" his career is to see him as a critic of an obsolete form of Marxism and a theorist of a new way of doing left politics that responds to the challenges of our times.\n\nIt is probably inevitable that debates like this, over the significance of Hall's life and legacy, are not explored in Akomfrah's film. But by introducing us to Hall as person and a thinker, and by evoking the tumultuous times in which he formulated his theories, the film challenges thoughtful leftist viewers to learn more about Hall and his complicated intellectual legacy. I hope that many DSA members, and particularly younger ones who are seriously committed to democratic socialism, will accept the challenge and determine for themselves what Hall's work does and does not mean for our struggle for democratic socialism in the U.S.","order":2},{"title":"May Day-Vietnam Legacies","date":"2015-04-30","issue":"May 2015","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"Fifty years ago, Congress passed the \"Gulf of Tonkin\" resolution that authorized the massive introduction of US troops into Vietnam. Based on a lie — an alleged North Vietnamese attack on a US patrol boat — that resolution ushered in a decade of military escalation that left tens of thousands of US soldiers and over one million Vietnamese dead. The war destroyed the possibility of directing resources to overcome poverty and justice within our own society and left in its wake physical destruction and adverse health consequences that continue to impact on the daily life of the Vietnamese people.\n\nFifty years also marks the beginning of what grew to be a massive anti-war movement that helped shape and transform our political culture and contributed to finally bringing our troops home and the end of the war 40 years ago — an anniversary also being celebrated this year. A commemoration/conference will be held May 1-2 in Washington DC; led by anti-war activists of the 1960s. The purpose of the gathering is to pose a challenge to those in the government, media and military who are trying to rewrite the history of the war and of war opposition, and to explore what can be learned from that past relevant to today's struggles for peace and justice.\n\nIt is perhaps serendipitous that the end of that war and May Day coincide, yet that coincidence has meaning — the attempt to link labor solidarity across national borders with the struggle to end militarization has been an aspect of May 1 demonstrations throughout the history of the socialist and labor movements. A look back as moments in the history of the Vietnam War and of the Peace movement sheds some light on the challenge and necessity of making such connections.\n\n**Setting the stage**\n\n*Tin soldiers and Nixon coming We're finally on our own This summer I heard the drumming Four dead in Ohio*\n\n*Gotta get down to it Soldiers are gunning us down Should have been done long ago What if you knew her And found her dead on the ground How can you run when you know?*\n\nFour Dead in Ohio ...\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\n\n\nRichard Nixon's election as President in 1968 was based, in part, upon his promise to end the war in Vietnam (albeit \"with honor\" i.e. based on an impossible-to-achieve \"victory\")) — the war, however, continued to drag on; so too did anti-war protests including 1969's National Moratorium which saw demonstrations, rallies and protests in cities and towns across the country followed by the National Mobilization, one of the largest demonstrations in Washington DC up to that time. The response by the White House was \"Vietnamization,\" that is a gradual reduction of US military personnel from its high point of 549,000 and their replacement by US-armed and -supplied Vietnamese troops loyal to the South Vietnamese government. This did have one desired effect from the standpoint of the Nixon Administration — the size and scope of anti-war protests began to decline. It also had one undesired effect for our government — the South Vietnamese government, lacking all popular legitimacy, was losing more and more ground on the battlefield which no amount of weaponry and US field support could overcome.\n\nThe White House therefore took a fateful step and launched, on April 30 1970, a full-scale invasion of Cambodia. Beginning on that day, continuing on to May 1st and growing thereafter the scale and militancy of antiwar demonstrations, especially on university campuses, spread across the country. So too did repression as police and National Guard responded with violence — culminating in the shooting of 4 students at Kent State University in Ohio on May 4, while days later six black protesters were shot and killed in Augusta, Georgia, after which police shot two black students at Jackson State, Mississippi.\n\nIn consequence, protest became more widespread — over 80 percent of all colleges across the country were on strike, and high school and junior high school students also began to strike in large numbers. But violence against protesters increased too, not only from government authorities but also from war supporters (and such public violence had been used against the peace movement from its inception). The most notorious of these took place on May 8 when construction workers — backed by their unions, backed by their employers, and given complete carte blanche by the police department — launched an assault on an anti-war march in lower Manhattan. This was followed by a large union-sponsored pro-war rally. Nowhere to be seen was the original spirit of May Day.\n\n**Changing times**\n\nBut nothing stands still — dramatic shifts were underway in the US, shifts that the war intensified. The Nixon Administration faced a crisis as the challenge to its legitimacy by popular movements coincided with a slowing of the post-World War II economic boom. Dragged down by military expenditures and other factors, US capital supremacy was facing challenges from Japan and Western Europe on one side, challenges posed\nby assertions of national economic sovereignty by Third World countries\non the other. The government response included a series of behind-the-scenes attacks on political opponents that eventually to lead to the Watergate break-in. It also included a series of belt-tightening and anti-union measures such as a wage freeze which brought Nixon into conflict with the unions that were supporting the Administration's foreign policy. And it included an ever more aggressive \"law-and-order\" campaign that combined an appeal to racism and an attack on intellectuals that prefigured the shape the Republican Party would assume.\n\nAs for the US trade union movement, its dominant leadership's response to shifting sands of time was to dig ever deeper within a schizophrenic politics of supporting an Administration's foreign policy while confronting its domestic policy — and of defining itself in support of an established order being challenged by growing numbers within its ranks. The leadership failed to lead or understand what was happening as workplace confrontations during the years 1969-71 massively expanded — in 1970 alone, there were more than 5600 strikes. These ranged from an illegal, wildcat strike by postal workers to national strikes against some of the largest and most powerful corporations of the era: AT&T, General Electric, General Motors. Meanwhile, a Labor Assembly for Peace called in 1967, and initially comprising local union activists and left-led union bodies, found its call for change echoed ever more widely. Two weeks after the attacks on war protests, a Labor-Student rally for peace was held in New York City around the call to \"End the War in Vietnam and Cambodia *Now*, Protest the Killings at Kent State, Augusta, and Jackson; Stop the Repression against Dissent and Protest.\" By 1971, the United Auto Workers, AFSCME, and the United Farm Workers had called for the war's end, as had the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the United Electrical Workers, Hospital Workers Local 1199, Distributive Workers District 65, and locals from the Teamsters, Steelworkers, Bakery Workers and many others across the country.\n\nThis was not only a change in leadership or a change in perspective — war weariness, war opposition was growing. Although given its most vivid expression amongst students and in counter-cultural communities, the spirit of disaffection and rebellion also found its way within the traditional working class. Moreover, the emergence of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, alongside the strength of anti-war sentiment and action amongst Black, Chicano, and Puerto Rican workers made its influence felt with labor organization. The formation of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists and of the Coalition of Labor Union Women were indicative of the way the confluence of union demands for equality and for peace were beginning to have an impact that was to become transformative. Thus although George Meany, the AFL-CIO Executive Council majority, the building trades union leadership and others of similar reactionary perspectives never wavered in their support for war and denunciations of anti-war protestors, their real influence declined.\n\nMeanwhile the peace movement — never monolithic — was undergoing another metamorphosis as frustration replaced hope due to the fact that the size and scope of protest actions was unable to stop the war, as witnessed by the US-led invasion of Laos in February 1971. The response of one section of activists was to directly tie demands for peace with broader demands of social activists organizing against poverty, discrimination and oppression, and so was born the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice which was to oversee a new range of protests in the months ahead.\n\n**May 1971**\n\nModeled on civil rights actions, those protests combined a wide range of differing means and methods — ranging from the People's Peace Treaty in which activists negotiated directly with Vietnamese around the terms of a US withdrawal, the People's Lobby in which thousands mobilized to address, argue and confront members of the House and Senate, finally culminating, under the aegis of the \"May Day tribe,\" a day of non-violent direct action throughout Washington DC in an attempt to shut down the city, an attempt to prevent business as usual. Police and military were prepared, attempts to disrupt traffic and shut government buildings were quickly halted and more than 1000 were arrested and detained in the Washington Coliseum. It was the biggest single action of civil disobedience in our country's history.\n\nAlthough a \"failure,\" in the literal sense that the government continued to function, and business proceeded as usual, the actions succeeded as a literal demonstration that action and disruption would continue as long as the war continued. And, indeed, alongside the confrontations in Washington DC, memorials were held for the murdered students at Kent State, Jackson State, and communities across the country... In New York City, more than 10,000 gathered to hear labor leaders and Vietnam veterans denounce the war, while 50,000 gathered in Boston and a larger gathering was held in San Francisco. At the same time, GI-led demonstrations were organized at Fort Hood, Fort Bliss, Fort Bragg, Fort Lewis and other military bases in the US and overseas. Nixon's Vietnamization had proved not only incapable of \"winning the war,\" it had also proved incapable of quelling domestic dissent. Not only were actions continuing, disparate protests and issues were starting to link up in a process of radicalization which seemed unstoppable at the time.\n\nA sign of change not obvious at the time was that there were fewer and fewer vigilante type attacks on peace rallies (though police and FBI repression remained and, in key respects, increased) — 1970 was the last year of mass popular pro-war mobilization. Conservative sentiment was still strong, as witnessed by the outpouring of support for Lt. William Calley after his conviction for the My Lai massacre in which US soldiers killed 347 civilians, old men, women, babies—for it was framed as a defense of soldiers in war not a defense of the war itself. Moreover such was not being led by unionists. The divide between labor and peace activism, so bitterly obvious in 1970, although far from healed, was beginning to be breached. Working-class and the anti-war movement were inching closer to each other, just as left-wing organizations were able to act with an openness in union meetings and in public events not seen since McCarthyism stifled all such speech. The May Day mass civil disobedience was a creative use of an old tradition, a new generation keeping the holiday alive by making it meaningful to the struggles with which they were engaged.\n\n**Aftermath**\n\n*I hammer the pain of separateness into a statue to stand in the park. Below it I carve a horizontal inscription that reads: Soul of the Twentieth Century*\n\nTru Vu\n\nNonetheless the war dragged on. Protests were ever-present, but not strong enough to end the killing and bring the troops home. Nixon was re-elected president by a huge margin in 1972, defeating George McGovern who had run on an explicit anti-war platform. But Nixon won only by promising a quick end to the war — and indeed, after one last orgy of violence in a Christmas week bombing of Vietnam that exceeded all bombings heretofore, an agreement was signed early in 1973 that led to US withdrawal from the war. Nixon was himself soon out of office, the illegal actions which led to his resignation under pressure of impeachment largely driven by his attempt to covertly expand the war and undermine protest.\n\nOther consequences included a staying of the hand of further US military armed interventions abroad which lasted nearly a decade until Reagan re-opened the floodgates with his invasion of Grenada. The draft was ended, 18-year olds won the right to vote, and peace and social justice movements learned that their causes could not be separated. So the internal process of change in organized labor could not be stopped, union activism against the Vietnam War was a direct precursor to union opposition to South African apartheid and to US-sponsored civil wars in Central America and that to the AFL-CIO's official opposition to the war against Iraq.\n\nBut like the May Day civil disobedience actions themselves, failure seems more apparent. Peace activism was unable to stop subsequent wars. To the contrary, we are now in an almost permanent state of war as invasions, bombings, covert actions and routine overseas killings are an almost unchallenged part of the national landscape. Labor's more progressive outlook today is expressed by a movement much weaker than that which existed in 1970-71; the confidence of strength that was expressed in rank-and-file militancy has been largely eroded. Demands for civil rights have moved forward but largely divorced from economic justice and so what has been gained often feels empty — poverty is rampant, hunger and homelessness on the rise, while national security repression and police violence are as deeply ingrained as ever.\n\nBut like the disappointed hopes of other May Days past, the gains and truths of previous times remain with us even in an era of retreat. As we confront today's challenges, they serve as a reminder of what was done and what could be done. Remaining alive to what was, however, means widening our field of vision; the war and anti-war movement after all, did not concern the United States alone.\n\n**One other May Day**\n\nOnce US troops left, all the guns and weapons could not keep the US-supported South Vietnamese government in power. Although newspaper accounts in the US emphasize the tragedy and fear for those supporters of the Saigon government and members of their military who wanted to flee when National Liberation Front and North Vietnamese troops entered Saigon (today's Ho Chi Minh City) on April 30, 1975, for most Vietnamese it was a time of celebration. Huge numbers supported the new government — their victory against US arms would otherwise have been inconceivable, while even for people who stayed on the sidelines there was cause to cheer the end of decade of war. So according to one eyewitness, that May 1st became a \"spontaneous people's holiday. No one gave orders. May Day was celebrated with no official programs, by hundreds of thousands of men and women who came from all over the city, by automobile, on Hondas, on foot, pouring into the center to 'see the Revolution.' \"\n\nOf course, subsequent parades were more organized, just as hopes for the future had to confront the hard work of rebuilding a country devastated\nby war and foreign occupation. The road to change and development first\nhad to deal with US sanctions and isolation, conflict with China, the collapse of the Soviet Union. Leftover bombs and mines extracted a price, as did the war wounds and birth defects left behind when our soldiers came home. Attempts to move forward quickly through centralized plans failed of their purpose; the subsequent development by opening a market allowed rapid growth and reduced poverty — but at the expense of the goal of equality that had been so central to the entire Vietnamese struggle for liberation. Yet that legacy is not entirely forgotten and frames contemporary debates and discussions as many in Vietnam have not given up on trying to find a way forward that will allow for economic growth that will also allow for greater public participation in the running of society and the meeting of still unmet needs.\n\nUnder vastly different conditions and social system we still can see a connection between our two countries, building on the legacy that sought and seeks to replace a world of war and injustice with a life worthy of all who live. Such an understanding contains the truth that puts to shame the lies that brought us to war in 1965 and has repeatedly brought us to war in years since, contains the truth of all those who took part in the Moratorium, mobilizations, protest rallies and teach-ins that aimed to bring to birth a world of peace and justice. And it is the truth that May Day ought to always express — and perhaps one day in this 21st century we might rid ourselves of the pain of separateness that defined the \"Soul of the Twentieth Century.\"\n\n*What would it mean to live in a city whose people were changing each other's despair into hope? — You yourself must change it — what would it feel like to know your country was changing? — You yourself must change it — Though your life felt arduous new and unmapped and strange what would it mean to stand on the first page of the end of despair?*\n\nAdrienne Rich, \"Dreams Before Waking\"\n\n***Quoted Material&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ***\"Four Dead in Ohio\" — liner notes\n\nTru Vu poem —\n\n**Fire in the Lake** by Frances Fitzgerald, Vintage Books, 1972 (p.567)\n\nLabor-Student Rally for Peace demands —\n\n**American Labor and the Indo-China Wa**r, by Philip S.

The ties between these twin holidays are deeper than explained by the happenstance and convenience in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, when the workers' holiday began and gradually overtook the prominence of the pagan Roman-Germanic-Gaelic medieval rites of spring. Consider these connections-\n\nThe legend of Robin Hood places the death of the populist outlaw on May 1. In old England a performance of the story of Robin Hood and Maid Marian was long part of the traditions revolving around song, dance and games around the Maypole. The modern workers' holiday closely followed the Haymarket deaths of workers seeking fairer distribution of wealth and power -Chicago, May 4, 1886.\n\nAn element of the Christian appropriation of the pagan May Day was the setting of that date in the Catholic calendar as the feast of St. Joseph the Worker.\n\nAmong a multitude of textile-mill strikers in New England, 1912, young women paraded with a banner reading \"We want bread and roses too.\" Their plea, for earnings enough to support a whole and satisfying way of life, inspired a stirring labor movement song.\n\nTime turns, and now the old May Day more nearly resembles our late-20<sup>th</sup> century Earth Day. Yet now we see ever more clearly how Labor and Land – over-commodified Nature and Society– are caught in the same trap. Before continuing the struggle against trade pacts and mean public budgets, perhaps we had better take in the spirit of both May Days. Let us pause in remembrance of unspoiled nature and unalienated society,to celebrate what remains of them and renew hope and strength for restoring them whole.","order":4},{"title":"Mayor Throws Her Weight in DC Special Elections","date":"2015-04-30","issue":"May 2015","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Mayor Muriel Bowser treated the April 28 special elections to fill two vacant DC Council seats as an opportunity to expand her clout, and early returns showed her aggressive campaigning on behalf of her favorites was paying dividends.\n\nIn Ward 4, the seat Bowser vacated upon being elected mayor, her protégé and former aide Brandon Todd won by a nearly two-to-one margin over his nearest rival, Renee Bowser (no relation to the mayor), an advisory neighborhood commissioner and former labor lawyer. Meanwhile, in Ward 8, Bowser favorite LaRuby May was holding a slim 2-percentage-point lead over her nearest rival Trayon White, with the final outcome in the 13-candidate field pending the counting of special ballots.\n\nWhile Bowser's influence weighed heavily in her home ward, the politician casting the biggest shadow over Ward 8 was the late Councilmember and longtime former Mayor Marion Barry, whose passing last November triggered the special election. May is a former Barry staffer and White, a former member of the Board of Education, worked on Barry's Council campaigns. Barry's own son Marion C. Barry also was seeking to fill his father's shoes but fell well short, finishing sixth in the 13-candidate race with only 7.2 percent of the vote.\n\nTodd cruised to victory despite considerable backing for Renee Bowser in progressive quarters. She picked up a substantial amount of union support, including that of UFCW (her former union), AFGE and the Teamsters. Todd was the favorite of local AFSCME unions as well as the Laborers and Firefighters. With such a split in labor support, the Metropolitan Washington Council of the AFL-CIO elected not to make an endorsement for Ward 4.\n\nThere was no such split in Ward 8, where local labor, including the local AFL-CIO council, was solidly lined up behind May. She also gained endorsements from groups not traditionally aligned with labor or progressives: the DC Association of Realtors, the Apartment and Office Building Association (AOBA), and the DC Chamber of Commerce. Todd also was endorsed by the DC Chamber and AOBA.\n\nAmong other progressive-leaning groups making endorsements, DC for Democracy endorsed Renee Bowser in Ward 4 but took a pass in 8. The venerable Gertrude Stein Democratic Club, an advocate for LGBT rights, trod the establishment path in endorsing both Todd and May, as did the *Washington Post*. Metro-DC DSA made no endorsements in the races.\n\nClearly, the mayor's Ward 4 \"Big Green Machine\" – first assembled by former Councilmember and Mayor Adrian Fenty and inherited by Bowser – was too much for rivals in that ward to overcome. The mayor's penumbra, however, was much fainter in Ward 8, and all her campaigning and the other endorsements for May didn't prevent voters there from thinking for themselves – with many concluding that Bowser didn't deserve all the power she craved.\n\nIf May does win the Ward 8 seat, however, Bowser will be in an especially strong position to push her agenda through the DC Council. Given that she ran an almost issue-free campaign, and her still-evolving agenda doesn't indicate alignment with the most progressive voices in DC, this would not be good news for the left. On the other hand, it will be harder for Bowser to deflect blame for policies or legislation that prove unpopular. It appears that for the next four years, the buck will stop at the mayor's desk.","order":5},{"title":"Not Your Chairman's China: Reflections on a Trip to the Middle Kingdom","date":"2015-04-30","issue":"May 2015","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"One could mistake the intersection of Wanfuging Dajie and Jinyu Hutong in Beijing for Times Square, or perhaps Tokyo's Ginza district. Splashy Apple, Samsung and Prada stores beckon customers to sample their wares, while bright plasma screens above them illuminate the night with advertisements to suggest how affluent Beijing residents might spend their money.\n\nThis is not your Chairman Mao's China.\n\nMy two-week trip to the Middle Kingdom was undertaken not for the purpose of observing the society's politics and culture, but rather to help chaperone an educational trip sponsored by my fifth-grade son's Mandarin immersion school. But I could not help comparing the sights before my eyes with the images and ideas I'd gleaned from afar during my lifetime – the bicycle-filled city streets at the time of President Nixon's 1972 visit; the ill-fated Tiananmen Square protest; and the prodigious output of China's factories, much of it by workers earning near-starvation wages.\n\nThe China I saw was much different than the picture in my mind's eye. In many ways it looked like America written in Chinese script: busy and modern, with traffic-choked streets, downtowns with high-end shops, and buildings reaching to the sky. But in the major cities – including the three I visited, Beijing, Chengdu and Guiyang – affluence and conspicuous consumption exist side-by-side with poverty and hardscrabble lives, the keepers of tiny shops barely large enough to turn around in, the beggars, the streetside food vendors. Again, not so different from the United States.\n\n*Poverty in the midst of modern Beijing*\n\nPhoto by Bill Mosley\n\nHowever, this is a China whose official ideology once condemned wealth and inequality, whose government treated \"rich peasants\" as criminals and trumpeted the necessity of individual poverty and self-sacrifice in the service of building socialism in the world's most populous country. And yet today wealth is celebrated in China — as author Evan Osnos puts it in his book *Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth and Faith in the New China* – much as it was in America's own Gilded Age of the late 19<sup>th</sup> Century. Yet while the substance of the old socialist faith has been thrown on the dust-heap, the party that once promoted a savage kind of equality – and then maneuvered a 180-degree turn to capitalism – remains firmly in power.\n\n*Shopping district in Beijing*\n\nPhoto by Bill Mosley\n\nAnd what of the architect of the old ideology, the great leveler, the enemy of wealth? What of Mao Zedong?\n\nTo answer that question, one need only to pass through the security checkpoints to Tiananmen Square, the site of the 1989 uprising in which hundreds of Chinese (the exact number remains in dispute) demonstrating for greater democracy in their society were gunned down by their own country's armed forces. On the north end of the square, a giant portrait of Mao hangs over the gate to Beijing's historic Forbidden City, home to the emperors that once were regarded as \"sons of heaven.\" And on the south is the massive mausoleum that contains Mao's preserved remains for all to visit and pay tribute to.\n\nAll day, the faithful stream into the mausoleum bearing yellow daisies (sold by vendors at the entrance) that they lay before a marble statue of the late Chairman, prostrating themselves at the image. Then they stream past the body within its glass enclosure, almost close enough, were it not for the glass barrier, to touch the red flag pulled up to this chin. From somewhere in the chamber an amber light shines upon Mao's face, one that makes it appear that the Chairman himself is the source of the light. Even in death, Mao casts his brilliance upon China.\n\n*Mao's mausoleum in Beijing*\n\nPhoto by Bill Mosley\n\nNext, travel 1,000 miles to Zunyi in country's southwest. A small, provincial city by China's standards, Zunyi still is home to more than 1 million persons, although it lacks the cosmopolitan atmosphere of the great cities of China's East – here one rarely encounters a speaker of English and foreigners are the object of much curiosity. All around Zunyi one sees posters encouraging a visit to the two-story colonnaded building that is the city's claim to fame – the site of the 1935 conference in which Mao was elected chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Visitors stream through the humble, dusty building in which the remnant of the party's leadership, which had been decimated in defeats at the hands of the Nationalist government, met to rethink their strategy and leadership. At Zunyi, the party cast out the old \"failed\" leaders and their Comintern-appointed European advisors and elected to pursue a more Chinese-style revolution, with Mao as its leader. And the rest, they say, is history.\n\nAnd for that history, one need only walk across the courtyard from the conference site, past the lady selling Mao-style fatigue uniforms as souvenirs – the outfits almost all Chinese wore at the time of Nixon's visit but no one does today – to the hulking \"Zunyi Conference Museum\" that dwarfs the conference building itself. All of the exhibit descriptions are in Chinese, but the outlines of the museum's story are clear even to someone who reads no Chinese: When the success of the revolution was in doubt, Mao emerged to deliver the \"correct\" strategy and lead the people to victory. Through photos, maps, artifacts, dioramas and plenty of socialist-realist art, Mao is cemented in place as China's savior and inspiration. Outside the conference site, along \"Red Army Street,\" the faithful can walk in the footsteps of Mao, Zhou Enlai and other party leaders and visit historic buildings where they once lived and worked.\n\n*The Zunyi Conference Site*\n\nPhoto by Bill Mosley\n\nThe image and memory of Mao is exalted while the substance of his ideas lies in tatters. How is this possible? Even the Party, during the reign of Deng Xiaoping – Mao's eventual successor and the architect of the country's hairpin turn to capitalism – judged Mao as 70 percent correct and 30 percent wrong. Nevertheless, the party finds maintaining the cult of Mao useful to legitimating its monopoly on power.\n\nYet the adulation of Mao at the mausoleum and the Zunyi museum are not mere creations of the party – no one is forcing people to lay daisies before Mao's image. To many Chinese, Mao represents something more than his Communist ideology: He is the symbol of China's unity and emerging power, its advancement to the forefront of the world stage. Before Mao came to power, China experienced war, division and dominance by foreign powers; since the revolution the world has been forced to respect, and at times fear, China. Mao's accession to power took place while many living Chinese had personal memories of the \"century of humiliation,\" the disastrous 19<sup>th</sup> Century in which China's self-image was shattered\nby Western invasion and domination. Older Chinese today harbor\ntraumatic memories of the Japanese invasion. Now, in 2015, China is as impervious to foreign military domination as a country can be. But it has traded one kind of invasion for another – the invasion of the capitalist world market.\n\n*Heroic imagery of the Zunyi conference*\n\nPhoto by Bill Mosley\n\nThirty-six years have now passed since Deng officially buried Mao's radical egalitarianism by proclaiming, \"Let some people get rich first and gradually all the people should get rich together.\" Since then, many Chinese have gotten rich – although the vast majority has not. But only 26 years have passed since the Party's even clearer statement, written in blood in Tiananmen Square, that it had no intention of allowing economic liberalization to be accompanied by political reform. The subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union only confirmed in the minds of China's leaders that it had adopted the right course; no *glasnost* for us, thank you.\n\nAnalysts have long predicted that China's embrace of capitalism would inevitably lead to democracy, or at least democratization – if nothing else, increasing contact with the West should lead to a more free flow of information that would lead the Chinese to question the Party's monopoly grip on power. And indeed, today there is more information flowing though China than ever before – as Osnos notes, today the Chinese are the world's largest users of the Internet. However, it is an Internet without Google, Facebook or other sites blocked by the government as a bit too free-flowing for its comfort. Tiananmen did not erase dissent from China – countless people protest their treatment at the hands of a government that does not regard itself as obliged to consider the views of the governed. And yet, as observed by Osnos and others, the dominant ethos in China today is the individualistic quest for wealth and status – an ethos the government is only too happy to encourage.\n\nAfter 36 years of China's experiment with capitalism, it seems safe to conclude that free enterprise and authoritarian government can live comfortably together. In fact, it is a model that could be profitably exported elsewhere. A country whose government s willing to suppress dissent, squelch independent unions and keep its low-wage workforce in a state of insecurity is an inviting target for foreign investment. Vietnam, for one, is embracing free enterprise within a \"socialist\" system. Is this also the future of Cuba?\n\nIt appears that if China is to ever become more democratic, it will not be due to its embrace of capitalism. One does not achieve freedom by demanding riches.","order":6},{"title":"Raising Class Consciousness Through Abortion Activism","date":"2015-04-30","issue":"May 2015","author":"M. C. Miller","body":"On April 26, 2015, the Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America local participated in the [*D.C. Abortion Fund's*](http://dcabortionfund.org/) (DCAF) annual billiards tournament to raise money for low-income women needing assistance in paying for procedures to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Despite a month of practice, DC DSA's team, unfortunately, did not move on from the first round. But the team members more than made up for their lack of skills with enthusiasm and a generous donation to DCAF. DSA's presence at the event also allowed members to network with others on the politic left and demonstrate their support for women's reproductive rights, an issue that highlights the intersections between gender and class in a way that many in the US might prefer to ignore.\n\nThough abortion ostensibly remains legal in the United States, measures such as the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds, including Medicaid, to pay for abortion procedures, as well as state laws forbidding health insurance companies from covering abortions, make access to abortion disproportionately difficult for low-income women. Additionally, the Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, also known as \"[*TRAP laws,*](http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_TRAP.pdf)\" often force local women's healthcare clinics to close, which makes traveling to those that remain more arduous and costly for working class women, who often must forfeit several days' pay to journey to clinics out of town or even out of state. The procedure itself in the first trimester alone can cost anywhere from $300-$950, though Sarah Erdreich's book *Generation Roe* includes accounts from women who paid nearly $20,000 out of pocket for the procedure and for travel to out-of-state clinics.\n\nSome middle-class women and certainly upper-class women will always enjoy the access to terminate unwanted pregnancies, regardless of abortion's legality, but low-income women are the ones who suffer the most when their reproductive rights are restricted. As U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg observed, \"There will never a woman of means without choice anymore...We have a policy that only affects poor women, and it can never be otherwise.\" Abortion cannot truly be a \"choice\" for women until all women have equal economic access to that choice. And according to studies by the Guttmacher Institute, poor women are [*five times as likely*](https://www.guttmacher.org/media/infographics/abortion-concentrated-among-poor2.html) to experience unwanted pregnancies, making their ability to access the [*economic benefits of family planning*](http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/16/1/gpr160108.html), such as completing an education or establishing a career, all the more difficult.\n\nAbortion is not merely a woman's problem—it is a class problem. Working-class women and their families face more barriers to acquiring abortions, and their difficulties in controlling their own bodies further restricts their life chances and opportunities for economic improvement. If abortion and reproductive healthcare generally were truly recognized as rights, then organizations like DCAF would not need to exist. Unfortunately, given the increasing restrictions our politicians are placing on abortion access, organizations like DCAF are necessary to ensure that women can receive the reproductive healthcare they need and to make the best decision they can for themselves, their bodies and their families. Given the current state of abortion politics, socialists may see some benefit to allying themselves to the abortion movement and using it as an opportunity to raise awareness about class consciousness. Abortion is just as much about class as it is about gender, and socialists and feminists together could create a productive dialogue that raises a larger cultural and social awareness of the inequalities not only of gender but also of class.\n\n[*The Humanistic Genius and Sad Decline of Fantasy Novelist Terry Pratchett: A Eulogy*](http://dsadc.org/the-humanistic-genius-and-sad-decline-of-fantasy-novelist-terry-pratchett-a-eulogy/)\n\nThursday, April 30th, 2015\n\n*By Andy Feeney*\n\n****I've been a socialist for far longer than I've enjoyed the fantasy novels of Terry Pratchett, a British writer who died in March from Alzheimer's disease. Over the years, I admit, I can't say I ever saw any evidence that Pratchett believed in socialism: At times, he seemed more shaped by libertarianism, at others, by a cheerfully cynical belief in enlightened despotism, like that proposed by Hobbes in *Leviathan.* Yet whatever Pratchett's politics, and whatever the limits of the genre in which he won fame, he also was a humanistic literary figure of genius, if a peculiar one. By his own account, Pratchett began as a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's magical *Lord of the Rings* trilogy; as a child, he apparently also thrilled to Kenneth Grahame's whimsical fantasy *The Wind in the Willows.* Yet as an adult author (after he had served a stint as a teenaged newspaper reporter, then as press agent for the Central Electricity Generating Board, where he did public relations for nuclear power), Pratchett cheerfully set out to subvert the fantasy genre he loved, by pointing out its logical absurdities. To millions of readers, including at least a few socialist ones, that made him interesting.\n\nTo the dreamy realm of magical fantasy that entrances many younger readers today, and to the sometimes gloomier realm of swords-and-sorcery novels that parallels it, Pratchett brought the gleeful social satire of early Monty Python sketches along with (occasionally) an almost Marxist class consciousness. The literary results, although they could be cartoonish and somewhat muddled in places, were often both thought-provoking and very funny. English literary critic A.S. Byatt once compared Pratchett's humanistic acceptance of common people and our foibles to Chaucer's approach in the *Canterbury Tales*, and I think Byatt was right. I therefore hope at least some other leftists will join me in celebrating the surprising artistry of this particular dead fantasy writer. On the other hand, I think it's best if they don't begin with Pratchett's last novel in the famous Discworld series, for it shows evidence of a brain degraded by Alzheimer's and by an equally deadly mental disease – capitalist neoliberalism.\n\nI first became aware of Pratchett's talents, I recall, through a cheap paperback copy of *Interesting Times* (**1994, 17<sup>th</sup> in the Discworld series**), a rather complexly — some would say, nonsensically — plotted novel that essentially imagines what Mao's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution might have looked like if its youthful Red Guards had never managed to shake themselves free from Confucian ideals of politeness and respect for elders. \"We must organize ourselves to overthrow the forces of repression gently,\" Pratchett has one of their leaders say – a sure sign that their revolt will be doomed, unless it receives outside help. Pratchett provides that help in comic-opera fashion by having their country invaded by a barbarian horde that in its name recalls the Mongols who actually did invade China in the 13<sup>th</sup> century, but who also resemble the Gray Panthers – a small platoon of extremely senior warriors, one of them in a wheelchair, who prevail against much younger foes through cynicism, guile and military skills honed through long lifetimes of practice. In the creation of Genghis Cohen and his Silver Horde, Pratchett plays satirical tribute to the battle against age discrimination in the workplace, while making readers laugh in the process. But the plot to *Interesting Times* – which in its first few pages seems to be determined, like the Trojan War, by the actions of meddling gods — ultimately turns on the existence of a particular species of butterfly that, in Pratchett's world, has evolved an ability to defeat predators by flapping its wings to generate tiny hurricanes. This plot device ironically echoes some of what real-world champions of Chaos theory were saying about the \"butterfly effect\" shortly before this novel appeared, and it makes *Interesting Times* a deft scientific satire, as well as a political one.\n\nAs his example of the hurricane-generating butterflies suggests, Pratchett playfully juxtaposed scientific and magical ideas in his novels, sometimes in an absurd fashion merely aimed at generating laughs, but often in ways that made apparent logical sense. He generated additional humor by trying to tease out the logical social implications of any given magical situation, at least as he imagined them. This gave him a license to segue easily from magic story-telling in the Tolkien tradition to rather pointed observations about contemporary affairs. By making magical fantasy thoughtful and above all, by making it socially complicated, he succeeded for many readers in making it intellectually worthwhile.\n\nPratchett's prime literary invention is the Discworld – a small planet shaped like a flat disk, which (as in some ancient human myths) travels through the universe on the back of four enormous elephants. The elephants stand in turn on the shell of a giant turtle – the only turtle in the universe, Pratchett once noted, ever to appear on the Russell-Herzprung diagrams used by astronomers. This flat, circular world is circled by a tiny sun that travels across above the Discworld during the daytime and sinks below the horizon overnight to make a return journey below the planet to reach its starting place at dawn.\n\nThis magical and pre-scientific world, in Pratchett's imagination, is populated not just by humans, but also by Fate, the gods, their ancient foes the Ice Giants, and a host of other supernatural and/or magical creatures – dwarfs, trolls, elves, large and small dragons, medieval golems, and also vampires, werewolves, gnomes, goblins, yetis and the like. The one supernatural character who makes an appearance in almost all the books is Death, who appears as a seven-foot skeleton wielding a sharp scythe, just as in some medieval European myths. Death always speaks in CAPITAL LETTERS. Many of the most powerful male humans are wizards; the most powerful human females are generally witches, and the chthonic ichor god Bel-Shamharoth, modeled after the horror tales of H.P. Lovecraft, lurks in an underground lair to eat the souls of unwary travelers.\n\nOn this obviously illogical planet, Pratchett postulated the logical social consequences of various magical conditions, and in doing so he cast a sharp eye on contemporary British society, in particular, and to a lesser degree humanity at large. In the very first Discworld book, *The Colour of Magic* (1983)*,* for example, the planet's greatest city, Ankh-Morpork, is totally destroyed by fire because a well-meaning foreign tourist with no cultural knowledge has strewn large coins around recklessly to a cash-hungry populace. This same fool has introduced Ankh-Morpork's merchants to a foreign novelty – fire insurance. A corrupt tavern owner promptly seeks to collect on his new policy by torching his own premises; the flames spread instantly, and soon the entire city is ablaze. What has destroyed it, a rather scorched and weary refugee from the fire tells a visiting barbarian hero, is a new and foreign kind of magic that he suspects is even more powerful than the kinds normally wielded by local wizards. This new magic, the refugee adds, has an odd foreign name resembling \"the reflected sound of underground spirits\" – or in other words, \"echo-gnomics.\"\n\nOn Pratchett's Discworld, magic abounds, and some highly creative plots hinge on it. But the magic of \"echo-gnomics\" often trumps the other kind, and the conflicts and social forces of our own time and our own universe repeatedly intrude into an alternative reality that Pratchett has patched together from a host of different cultural sources. His magical world is constructed partly around themes taken from Tolkien's Middle Earth, partly from scenes and settings borrowed from Shakespeare and medieval fairy tales, partly with ideas taken from the *Wizard of Oz,* the swords and sorcery novels of Fritz Lieber, and the dragon world books of Anne McCaffrey, and partly from Dungeons and Dragons, snippets of Hollywood vampire movies, old Greek and Egyptian myths and selected Disney cartoons. All of these fantasy materials, which Pratchett apparently loved, are – well – almost magically transformed when exposed to important features of our own society and time. Thus in *Men at Arms,* for example, Pratchett imagined what happens to a world of swords and sorcery when it is introduced to firearms. In this and several other Discworld novels, the city of Ankh-Morpork struggles with the difficulties of affirmative action in a multi-species police force; in other novels, there is ethnic rioting between the city's immigrant dwarfs and trolls; and in the drawing rooms of the rich, class consciousness becomes evident as the city's wealthy aristocrats express their distaste for the city's newest immigrant groups and the lower class humans that the aristocrats are exploiting economically.\n\nIn Ankh-Morpork as in real life today, both the aristocratic rich and the disaffected poor sometimes plot to overthrow the government, and in a memorable book called *Sourcery,* the fat, generally sedate wizards of Unseen University in Ankh-Morpork are converted by a charismatic leader into a ruthless technocratic elite willing to raze all existing society to achieve a quasi-fascist utopia. In *Jingo*, Pratchett imagines the city being lured into neo-imperialist war, partly through the wiles of a foreign foe but partly through the bloodlust of common people, the machinations of local arms merchants and the arrogant stupidity of the city's hereditary warrior aristocracy. In still other novels, Pratchett imagines Ankh-Morpork being transformed through the introduction of Hollywood movies (*Moving Pictures*, 1990), modern journalism (*The Truth*, 2000*)* and rock and roll (*Soul Music* in 1994)*.* For readers who grew up with the Yuletide holiday traditions of the United States and the UK, Pratchett's novel *Hogfather* (1996) may be the funniest satire of commercialized Christmas shopping ever written.\n\nUnlike Douglas Adams, author of *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, with whom he was sometimes compared, Pratchett actually seemed to care for his characters, including many of his villains. His plots generally end with the good guys winning, and his satire is almost never mean. His plots sometimes hint at extreme violence happening offstage, yet almost never share descriptions of this with the reader. Pratchett's repeated insertion of jokes in his early books – jokes good, bad, awful, and sometimes quite ancient – indicates a writer of basically sunny disposition. Yet for all of Pratchett's humor and good nature, the Discworld has a disconcerting tendency of looking a lot like Earth, and every intelligent reader recognizes what *that* means.\n\nThus in Discworld as Pratchett portrays it, the gods customarily demand blood sacrifices, and occasionally strike atheists with lightning. More or less regardless of what the gods themselves may prefer, the Discworld's most zealous evangelical religion expands via ruthless military conquest and the torture of suspected heretics — although a bit like Christianity, it eventually undergoes a humanistic reformation. The city of Ankh-Morpork has a complicated guild system, a bit like medieval Florence, but also like Florence, it is ruled by an intelligent tyrant, Lord Vetinari (the name is a punning reference to the famous Medicis). A local wizard explains in one book that Ankh-Morpork has a political system of \"one man, one vote\" – that is, Lord Vetinari really is a man, and he definitely does have the vote.\n\nA great deal like republican and imperial Rome as well as nineteenth century London, Ankh-Morpork has a history of invading and conquering most of its neighbors, although a good deal like modern London, it has largely abandoned wars of conquest and prefers to swindle foreigners instead in complicated business deals. The city's leading lawyer, Mr. Slant, is a zombie, with Pratchett's implication being that many lawyers are. Its best-known small businessman, a Mr. Dibbler, sells largely indigestible fast foods to people who have not learned to avoid him, and is something of a threat to public health. Two of Pratchett's favorite minor characters, who often provide a comic Greek chorus commenting on his plots, are cowardly and none-too-brilliant policemen, one of whom is a petty thief – with the implication, again, being that a number of policemen are like this.\n\nLike modern London when I visited the place in the 1970s, Ankh-Morpork hosts some creative beggars, one of Pratchett's favorites being Foul Ole Ron, who simply stands near unsuspecting victims and overwhelms them with his powerful odor while screaming crazy obscenities into the air. Eventually, most people pay him to go away. Ankh-Morpork also supports a guild of prostitutes, although they call themselves Seamstresses, and a guild of professional thieves, who as a convenience to the public have arranged a subscription service so that one can pay a small yearly fee in place of being mugged. The city also contains a dangerous slum, the Shades, that is so horrible that even many criminals avoid it. And like London under Queen Victoria, the city is socially split between an upper-class residential sector that is the center of theater, culture and government, on the one hand; and a lower-class industrial area on the other, where all physically necessary but disagreeable work is done. Separating the two halves of the city is a river, the Ankh, so grossly polluted that small bushes grow on its surface, and corpses thrown onto the surface of the water sometimes corrode before they sink. The smell of the Ankh and of the city's many private cesspits is all-pervasive; Pratchett at one point says it pervades the sinuses like a band saw cutting metal. This is gleefully exaggerated satire, of course, but the polluted Ankh is remarkably similar in some ways to the real-world Thames during the mid-Victorian age, when the river's surface sometimes did seem crusted over, and Londoners experienced four separate cholera epidemics spread by water contamination. On one memorably hot summer day, the reek of rotting human waste in the Thames just below Westminster forced the closure of both Houses of Parliament. The customary odor of Ankh-Morpork thus has more real-world historical precedents than many Pratchett readers may realize.\n\nIn his portrayal of the Discworld, in short, Pratchett does a great deal to make fantasy nearly as complicated and messy as real life; in a cartoonish, Monty-Python fashion, he uses his almost surrealistic imagination to paint a rather realistic if ironic portrait of the world we actually inhabit. As a Marxist (although a Marxist with an adolescent taste for fantasy and science fiction), I find this feature of Pratchett's universe enormously attractive. But although some friends and critics of Pratchett say that at heart, he was a world-be reformer, as many satirists are, most of the novels go beyond mere satire and pleas for reform. They are not pamphlets, but stories about characters that Pratchett himself seemed to like, and that he induces us to care about as well.\n\nFor all of his love for Tolkien's the *Lord of the Rings,* Pratchett differs sharply from Tolkien in making many of his best and strongest characters female. How much a male fantasy writer can presume to know about female psychology is debatable, yet several younger women I've met who have read Pratchett are particularly impressed by his witches, especially Granny Weatherwax, a powerful crone; Nanny Ogg, a cheerful and rather bawdy matronly witch with a huge family and many grandchildren; and Perdita and Magrats, two younger and rather conflicted witches. Taken as a group, Pratchett's witches represent the three phases of the Goddess as some modern Wiccans imagine her – the Maiden, the Matron and the Crone, who together are supposed to stand for the three major stages in a woman's existence. Another female Discworld character that one woman of my acquaintance likes a lot is Angua, a werewolf in love with a human prince, who displays power, intellect and professionalism in her day job – she is part of the multi-species Ankh-Morpork police force – but who also is prey to powerful and sometimes destructive passions under a full moon, and who struggles at times with deep feelings of jealousy and social insecurity. Still another powerful Discworld female is Susan Sto Helit, the adopted granddaughter of Death himself, who as a teenaged girl is forced to take on Death's responsibilities in one book and proves rather good at them.\n\nPratchett's most important male character, Sam Vimes, is a deeply conflicted cop with a complex family background. A distant forebear, rather like Oliver Cromwell in real-world England, executed the last sitting king of Ankh-Morpork, but Vimes initially grows up in poverty and develops an acute drinking problem as well as the instincts of a street brawler before he finds himself married to a very wealthy woman and rising – to his surprise — into the aristocracy. In most of the Discworld books, Vimes gives Pratchett an opportunity for cynical social commentary, for as a former street brawler and policeman on the beat, Vimes tends to despise the rich and well born, even as he finds himself rising into their class.\n\nAnother important and lovable male character, albeit a minor one, is Leonard of Quirm, an eccentric artist and inventor whom Pratchett loosely modeled after Leonardo da Vinci. Like the real-world Leonardo, Leonard of Quirm is a talented weapons designer, repeatedly coming up with ideas for new kinds of horrifying killing machines, and for all of his innocence, he is quite dangerous: Lord Vetinari locks him up for this reason. But what's most telling about Leonard, I think, is that Pratchett makes him almost helpless in the face of his own intellect and creativity. The universe is constantly being bombarded by little particles of creative inspiration, Pratchett writes, and it is Leonard's doom to be open to most of them. He is constantly being distracted by stray insights, observations, and ideas for new inventions, so much so that he can hardly get anything done, and I suspect that in some of his earliest Discworld books, Pratchett found himself in Leonard's plight. Pratchett's sheer inventiveness, when he was a younger author, probably explains some of his overly complicated plots and seemingly irrelevant digressions, not to mention his bad puns, while adding to the richness of the world he was creating.\n\nThe one nearly constant character in all the Discworld books, as mentioned above, is Death. Sometimes the Grim Reaper appears only briefly in a story, and rather humorously – as in *The Light Fantastic* (1986), where a visitor to his realm sees him learning to play bridge with War, Famine and Disease, making a \"fourth for bridge\" for the traditional Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In another early novel, we see Death on vacation and trying to have \"fun\" as humans somehow experience it, and at last succeeding in getting drunk in a nearly deserted bar. Like many drunks, he becomes gloomy, telling the bored bartender, \"I HATE MY JOB.\"\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" the bartender says soothingly; he has heard this from a lot of customers.\n\nNO, Death insists, I MEAN, I REALLY, *REALLY* HATE MY JOB. And of course, considering the work he does, this makes perfect sense. In yet another early book, Death says to a newly deceased murder victim, KNOCK, KNOCK.\n\n\"Who's there?\" the murder victim replies; he is still hazy about just what's happened to him.\n\nDEATH, is the answer. Then a pause, as Death tries to explain: I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT I SHOULD TRY TO MAKE THIS SOMEWHAT MORE ENJOYABLE.\n\nGiven his awareness of human mortality, Pratchett refused to engage in histrionics or self-pity when his doctors informed him, in 2007, that what he had thought was a small heart attack was instead evidence that he had an early-acting kind of Alzheimer's disease. As a writer who had imagined Death telling KNOCK, KNOCK jokes, Pratchett declared to his fans that he was still optimistic about continuing to write for as long as he could, and in subsequent years he published several additional Discworld novels, as well as a number of books for young adults.\n\nPratchett by this time had won numerous science fantasy and science fiction awards and had become one of the best-selling English language authors in the world, although J.K. Rowling of \"Harry Potter\" fame eventually eclipsed his record sales. In 2009 he was knighted for his services to English literature; he also become a much-quoted spokesman for the right to assisted suicide and a champion of orangutan conservation, among other causes.\n\nAmong Pratchett's fans, many claim to believe his last several books are equally good as his early ones, or better. The latter books, it is true, include fewer bad puns, fewer Dickensian minor characters, fewer Monty Python-style comic routines — some of them failures – and fewer plots that are meandering or chaotic.\n\nSome of the later books also address, in relatively straightforward fashion, very serious moral themes – the evils of slavery and genocide, the folly of making a modern banking system rely on the gold standard, the damage that childhood bullying does to victims, and so on. Gone are most of the humorous subplots involving smelly beggars; imperious, bawdy and/or gluttonous witches; cowardly and dishonest cops; the Ankh-Morpork Thieves Guild, and magical talking dogs with a penchant for cynicism. Gone is Leonard of Quirm, too, and Angua the werewolf and Vimes the cynical policeman make only brief appearances. Death, too, becomes a less frequent visitor in the books, and there are fewer authorial interjections about the oddities of human nature and scientific dogma. Instead, Pratchett in several of the later novels provides rather straightforward adventure stories with clear narrative lines, which probably appeal to readers who like their fantasy neat.\n\nWhat Pratchett evidently lost to Alzheimer's disease, however, and what I think he lost due to his book sales hitting the 85 million mark and the Queen knighting him, were his appreciation for social irony, his flashes of class consciousness about the pitfalls of capitalism, and above all his Leonardo-style taste for complexity. In the earliest books, Pratchett is not completely sold on the merits of economic and social progress, and he revels in exploring some of its negative sides. In the later books, he seems entranced by a new kind of protagonist – the progressive, if rascally, capitalist entrepreneur, whose adventures and misadventures frame most of the plots. Thus his character Moist von Lipwig, a convicted con man and swindler, is deputized by Lord Vetinari to reform the Ankh-Morpork post office in *Going Postal*, and in *Making Money* Moist is ordered to fix the city's banking system, which he takes off the gold standard to the benefit of the local economy.\n\nThe final Discworld book (*Raising Steam,* 2013) has Vetinari ordering this ex-swindler, but currently successful banker, to organize the development of a modern railroad system linking Ankh-Morpork with a number of foreign locations, including the distant realm of a vampire queen and a dwarf king (each of them a Vetinari ally) in a place called Uberwald. In several previous novels, Vetinari has decided to block the commercialization of new technologies that he deems to be dangerous to the city, and for a few seconds he hesitates about approving the development of the railroad, which he realizes will inevitable destroy some existing businesses and eliminate some existing jobs.\n\nBut after some consideration, Vetinari decides that the railway will bring overwhelming benefits to the city's economy, and construction of the thing proceeds. The main force opposing it, as it turns out, is a group of religiously fundamentalist dwarfs who hate it as a sign of modernity and who also happen to have a highly misogynist culture, and are appalled that female dwarfs living in Ankh-Morpork have begun to take on what – for conservative dwarf culture – are sexually daring ways. To block the railroad's expansion into Uberwald, the dwarf religious fundamentalists turn, basically, to terrorism. And Moist von Lipwig, an entrepreneurial-minded rascal who loves business partly because it gives him an opportunity to take exciting risks, pushes the railroad line to completion and engages in a thrilling battle against the terrorists on top of a moving train before *Raising Steam* reaches its conclusion. Dwarf society as a whole also experiences something resembling a feminist revolution, and at the end of the book, the fundamentalist terrorists are on the run.\n\nIn short, Pratchett's last Discworld novel shows every sign of embracing what many capitalist economists have taken to calling \"creative destruction,\" the revolutionizing of existing life through constant technological and business innovation. The book was published before the exploits of ISIS and Boko Haram started making headlines, but the text suggests that Pratchett along with many other westerners had evidently decided, before it appeared, in favor of some kind of struggle against what the late Christopher Hitchens once called \"Islamofascism.\" I'm not sure we should blame Pratchett for that.\n\nBut in this last book, lamentably, Pratchett seems to have lost most of his earlier taste for irony, nuance and social complexity and his cynical realism about the economic roots of much western foreign policy. Gone is most of the earlier realization that like many of Leonard of Quirm's machines, some kinds of capitalist technological progress are dangerous. Gone is the sense of moral and cultural relativism that marked such Discworld novels such as *Jingo* and *Thud*. In the place of the earlier, messier novels with their paradoxes and their complexities, we have in Raising Steam a basically pro-modernist, pro-capitalist adventure story, and not a very interesting one at that.\n\nI wondered after reading this book if after all these years, Pratchett's rising income from having sold 85 million books over his career, coupled with his knighthood from Queen Elizabeth, might have gradually blunted the class consciousness and pacifism that marked some of his earlier works. But on reflection, I think Alzheimer's was probably more to blame. Perhaps as his mental abilities dwindled, and his ability to appreciate complexity declined, Pratchett returned to some of the simplistic libertarian certainties that he may have held to early in his writing career. It also seems that the book, with a dedication to \"David Pratchett, Engineer,\" is in some part Pratchett's tribute to the memory of his own father. But in passages describing Moist von Lipwig's daring fight with the terrorists on top of a moving train, Pratchett makes in clear that for Moist, battling for the railroad represents one last daring adventure, one final risk of insane but exciting risk, as he faces the inevitability of advancing age. For Pratchett, increasingly aware of what Alzheimer's disease was doing to his mental capacities, *Raising Steam* also seems to have represented one last adventure, one last battle against old age and death.\n\nIf Pratchett's brain was too compromised toward the end to escape from the simplistic sense of economics and politics that he may have once learned as a young libertarian, I think even Marxist readers like me can forgive him for it. But the capitalist celebration of \"creative destruction\" via technological progress IS simplistic, and the historic growth in fossil fuel consumption that the earliest coal-powered, steam-driven railway locomotives helped to ensure shows that creative destruction is often dangerous as well.\n\nSimilarly, the battle of western modernity against ISIS-style jihadism and Muslim fundamentalism may or may not be justified – democratic socialists in the United States seem rather divided over this issue. But conceptualizing the fight of *Jihad vs. McWorld* (as historian Benjamin Barber once phrased it) as one involving a simple battle of good against evil is simplistic as well. The younger Terry Pratchett, I think, would have been alert to the tricky complexities underlying both technological progress and modernist war, even modernist war fought against feudal misogyny. The Alzheimer's-depleted older writer of 2013 no longer had the mental strength to avoid the clichés. It's all quite understandable. But it's sad, I think, that the wildly creative writer of *Jingo, Thud!* and *The Colour of Magic* should have eventually come to writing capitalist morality plays like this.","order":7},{"title":"Utilities Feel Threat of Sustainable Tech","date":"2015-04-30","issue":"May 2015","author":"Daniel C. Adkins","body":"In popular culture it is said that you need to know just one thing. In the energy it was just a few fuels. Mother nature works differently by having thousands of ecological niches and now humans are beginning to find so many energy niches that utilities are beginning to fear for their relevancy – so much so they have sued a federal agency for relief. As renewables and new tech diffuse we are seeing the possibility of a much less centralized but more connected energy sector.\n\nRooftop (PV) solar and wind are beginning to have such an impact in some states that utilities are blocking initializations and charging increasing amounts for rooftop connections and slowing wind development. Part of the problem is that electric-power supply grids need to balance electricity production or the grid becomes unstable. Utilities have not made their grids smart enough and they are used to having to coordinate only a few power plants. Now the utilities need to be able to identify the power from home systems in real time but do not have a method to do it yet. It is doable by smart meters or sampling and modeling. So instead of inventing the future, utilities are trying to slow it down. We can only hope they can soon get over the cultural shock of their changing industry.\n\nNew techniques are being employed which expand wind energy's usability. Some of these involve storage methods that allow wind energy to be saved for peak demand hours. They include better batteries, as well as the use of ice to store energy when the demand is low at night. This stored energy would then be available during peak demand during the day. Batteries can provide energy directly during the day's peak demand and so can [*Ice Energy's Ice Bear*](http://www.altenergymag.com/article/2015/04/storing-energy-by-making-ice/19563), which has worked with commercial, utility, and industrial partners.\n\nThe Ice Bear links to traditional air conditioning units by computers and liquid refrigerant. The Ice Bear uses electrical energy at night to move water from a liquid to solid phase when it requires less energy to do so. During the peak heat of the day, the Ice Bear transfers the cold to the air conditioner by a refrigerant liquid. This saves the electrical daytime energy that would be required to run the air conditioner's compressor.\n\nNewly deployed commercial and residential batteries are now being used to work with micro grids. SolarCity Corp. has created software to keep peak costs down when used with batteries. SolarCity is using Tesla's new commercial batteries to eliminate power outages and peak electric costs in California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Micro grids could be a solution for neighborhoods, universities, office parks, military bases, and mixed with renewables might become independent and self-sufficient.\n\nPassive energy housing can significantly lower the energy cost of housing. A passive building is one that has no (or little) in the way of active heating or cooling systems. Some of these units are being built in New York City where buildings account for 71 percent of carbon emissions and the de Blasio administration is looking to use passive standards to decrease energy consumption. The passive system works by building an airtight envelope and ventilation to exchange interior and exterior air. Heavy insulation and triple pane windows are also used.\n\nIn Copenhagen the city is networking street lamps and streetlights to save the cost of lighting and petroleum. The new LED lights save energy, and motion sensors turn off the lights when cars are not present. Smartphone apps for trucks and traffic signals on the bike paths let truckers, buses and cyclists link their speed to match the changing street lights and thus minimize costly starts and stops, saving fuel. Copenhagen's goal of becoming the world's first carbon-neutral capital by 2025 looks promising.\n\nSome of these techniques are currently being used by Southern California Edison, which has an excess of nighttime wind energy. If a utility bases its pricing on the time of day the energy is used, then these techniques are saving peak energy costs. An older way of meeting peak demand would be to use a jet turbine using oil or gas or have a dedicated power plant. A full-scale implementation of these and other techniques will decrease the need for a number of power plants that burn fossil fuels by dropping peak energy needs.\n\nHowever, no good deed goes unpunished. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) created a policy lowering peak demand. The policy allows electric customers to unplug units to avoid high peak costs. This tactic has so frightened some utilities that the Electric Power Supply Association sued FERC claiming that retail customers should not have the right to follow interstate rules. A court ruled against FERC and we will see if FERC goes to the Supreme Court. The utilities claim that the only way to ensure no blackouts is with dedicated power plants. They would have a point if the agreement to turn power units off were not reliable or enforceable. So we have a choice between legal agreements or mostly unused power plants. The battle is between utility rights to sell fossil fuels versus residences and businesses that want to use energy efficiency to reduce their costs.\n\nThe energy environment battle is becoming clearer. It is a battle between fossil fuel industries and utilities that are fighting for the right to make money the way they always have and a cheaper, distributive, energy efficient, less polluting, and sustainable future.","order":8},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—May 2015 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"May 2015","order":-1,"date":"2015-05-05","body":"**Welcome to the May edition of the Washington Socialist, the monthly email newsletter of the Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America.**\n\nMay Days come and they go, always trying to wedge into the wider consciousness the notion that the day is dedicated to a celebration of worker rights and dignity everywhere – except, largely, in the US.

They are \"Mankind: The Story of All of Us,\" \"The Men Who Built America,\" and \"Dustbowl.\" All told there are over 20 hours of public television programing.\n\n**Mankind: The Story of All of Us** starts with the inventors of farming, trade, buildings and war technology. As a TV series it cannot be as deep as Guns, Germs and Steel, but as a quick overview it is not bad and gives more weight to China. An example of this is that over two millennia ago the first emporia of China had a military that had mass-produced standardized cross bows. This was a technique used in the west 2,000 years later. It also estimates worker's situation by using more recent studies of the cadavers of Egyptian pyramid craftsmen to identify the rate building accidents by broken bones. Thus it tries to more evenly show social evolution and technology.\n\n**The Dust Bowl** by Ken Burns is a beautiful and depressing story of ignorance and inflexibility in the face of environmental change. Part of the ignorance was poor understanding of the fragility of the grasslands and their history. Also shown are the migrations out of the western plains and the social and political repercussions. Part 2 shows the government's response to the tragedy and the various economic and environmental programs and teachings. With the global rise in temperature and the resulting decrease of water in some areas it will be a gamble if future dust bowls can be averted.\n\n**The Men Who Built America** is a history of US industrialization in the late 1800s. The series revolves around Cornelius Vanderbilt (railroads), John D. Rockefeller (oil), Andrew Carnegie (steel), J P Morgan (electric industry), and Henry Ford (cars). Lionizing the Robber Barons and its focus on the 1% is a skewed focus at best and a bourgeois myth at worst but this history does place the period in the unregulated new markets of the late 1800s. These barons are not depicted as technical innovators but rather manipulators and organizers of unregulated new industries. It identifies the real horror of the resulting depressions and the oppression of the workers and their organizations. This series peaks with these competitors joining together to buy a president so as to keep their markets unregulated. History provides a surprise In Teddy Roosevelt, who moves progress along by battling monopolies. If only Obama had a little of Teddy in him we would not be at the mercy of Wall Street banks.\n\nWhen the US was created, 90 percent of non-slave work was in farming. If there were market depressions at least most of the US then had access to food and housing. In the panics of the late 1800s, working families not only lost access to food but housing too. Production became more interdependent and connected but profits stayed private. Risks were taken by the Robber Barons but the only risks to food and shelter were experienced by the workers. We still have this system with the exception that Wall Street risks are taken by the public and there is a bit of a safety net.\n\n[*The nonprofit model for health care cost containment*](http://dsadc.org/the-nonprofit-model-for-health-care-cost-containment/)\n\nMonday, December 3rd, 2012\n\n**The *Washington Socialist* &lt;&gt;December 2012 **\n\n*By Woody Woodruff*\n\nDemocratic socialists and other progressives can find ourselves in a real bind when it comes to the politics and practices of healthcare.\n\nWe find ourselves in the familiar, unpleasant posture of playing defense against calls for drastic cuts in social expenditures, including those for health care – Medicare, Medicaid and the numerous smaller federal and state-level programs that supplement the provision of care to low-income persons lacking employer-provided insurance.\n\nAnd our first response is a Gompers-like \"more\" – a call for higher public expenditures to match the burgeoning cost of the current health care system, which has proved highly resistant to attempts to reduce those costs. Class-based political stances aside, this may not be the historical moment to be asking for \"more.\"\n\nIt's clear that cost containment in US healthcare is a joke – that health systems in other first-world nations, whatever their conformation, deliver better care for far less cost. Much of the eventual success of the Affordable Care Act, AKA Obamacare, is pinned to projected cost savings. But how? Where are the pressure points progressives can focus on to reduce costs without cutting services? And on what points will the industry fight back most fiercely?\n\nThose other industrial nations' systems provide likely clues. Some are the progressives' quest-grail: single-payer. Others (like the Netherlands) use private insurers, many (but not all) nonprofit. Germany's is fueled by a progressive, income-based payroll tax but insured by about 200 private funds, all of which must be nonprofit to participate in the national system. Many consider Germany's the most likely model for the US, and if the incentives and requirements for insurer participation in ACA could be incrementally adjusted in progressive directions, nonprofits could gradually replace the for-profit system that has made US health care the costliest.\n\nIn 2008, Bob Kuttner estimated that of the $2.1 trillion spent annually on health care in the US, $400-500 billion goes to satisfy profit margins and shareholders. That's a fat target, probably getting fatter.\n\nIn 2011, Steve Hill outlined the attractions of the German system in the ***Washington Monthly***.\n\n\"Contrary to stereotype,\" Hill wrote, \"not every country in Europe employs single-payer, or government-run, 'socialized medicine.' Unlike single-payer in Britain, Canada or Sweden, other nations like France and Germany have figured out a third way that not only appears to perform better than single-payer, but it also might be a better match for the American culture.\" Like AHCA, they mandate individual participation, but \"a key difference is that in France, Germany and elsewhere, the private insurance companies are *non-profits* instead of for-profits.\" Unlike the \"system\" in the US (more like a free-fire zone) \"you don't have health care CEOs making tens of millions of dollars. Nor do you have stockholders demanding the highest return for their investment. Generally speaking, the profit motive has been wrung out of the system,\" in Hill's description. That would have amounted to one-fifth of US health care expenditures in 2008, again using Kuttner's numbers.\n\nObserving that some technically \"nonprofit\" health care systems in the US still rake in big bucks and pay outlandish CEO compensation, Hill points to the complementary policy that manages that factor in the European examples: \"negotiated fees for service. In these 'shared responsibility' systems, fees for every health care service and product are negotiated between representatives of the health care professions, the government, patient-consumer representatives, and the private nonprofit insurance companies.\"\n\nThis is where the national scale of ACA could provide the canvas for these kinds of enforced savings – savings that would give nonprofits a level playing field, if not an actual advantage.\n\nNotice, however, that Hill has spilled the beans about the European health care systems: they are premised on \"shared responsibility\" – a social compact that is foreign to US culture except, perhaps, in time of war.\n\nUwe Reinhart, a Princeton economics professor focusing on health care, notes that the systems in France, Germany and the Netherlands are \"goaded by tight regulation to work toward socially desired ends.\" (We should note the in-process nature of this description.) And he, too, acknowledges that US culture contains the contradictory beliefs in a right to health care and a right to reject a mandate. That \"immature, asocial mentality is rare in the rest of the world,\" he says.\n\nAs Hill points out, if privileging the nonprofit sector is proposed as a solution in the US, \"the for-profit health care corporations in the United States, and the politicians who do their bidding, will fight tooth and nail against the only types of reforms that have ever proven successful at reducing costs. But U.S. health care costs are so high, and so threatening to the nation's future, that eventually the logic of reform will prevail.\" It would be pretty to think so, but as we have seen in the past decade, that \"immature, asocial mentality\" is still deeply ingrained in the US public.\n\nACA contains some leanings toward reform that could make it more effective than it first appears (considering what seemed to be total capitulation to the big for-profit insurers). Obamacare is already pointing toward incentivization of nonprofits with its requirement for an 80% or better \"medical loss ratio.\" That's the percentage that must be devoted directly to provision of medical services; as Kuttner puts it, \"the percentage of the premium dollar actually paid out in health care benefits.\" This could be the leverage that will incentivize and indirectly select nonprofits; it is hard to imagine a full-blown buccaneer capitalist health care insurance corporation that can confine its shareholder dividends, promotion, and CEO compensation to 20% of total premiums.\n\nIt's likely that medical loss ratios will be a major front for industry lobbyists, who will try to cut those percentages back, leaving more room for profits – that is, rewarding shareholders, advertising agencies and top management.\n\nAnd it's becoming clear to even conservative economists that, whatever value markets have in the general realm of retail and service, they perversely reward inefficiency in the health care sphere. Kuttner's 1999 account in the *New England Journal of Medicine* describes a boom in for-profit HMOs in the decade 1987-1997, in which the number covered by for-profits rose from 42 percent to 62 percent in a decade. The bonanza was followed by a bust of proliferation and consolidation that brought on the piratical practices of today's most notorious corporate HMOs, overpromising to gain market share followed by draconian cuts in benefits to stay competitive on Wall Street. Consumers and regulators, at this point, engaged in a joint backlash that showed they still had some power and curtailed many of the worst excesses. But the scene for today's chaotic health care marketplace was set.\n\nIn 2008, Kuttner updated the state of play in another *NEJM* article: \"The extreme failure of the United States to contain medical costs results primarily from our unique, pervasive commercialization. The dominance of for-profit insurance and pharmaceutical companies, a new wave of investor-owned specialty hospitals, and profit-maximizing behavior even by nonprofit players raise costs and distort resource allocation.\"\n\nJust a week ago at this writing, three economists in the *New York Times* noted that \"Certainly, it is hard to be against competition. Economic theory is clear about its indispensable benefits. But not all health care markets are composed of rational, well-informed buyers and sellers engaged in commerce.\" The health exchanges in ACA that are designed to give individual insurance purchasers the tools for making good choices, they say, perversely degrade the efficiencies that large providers can offer by fragmenting the market.\n\nSo, \"If health insurance exchanges divide up the market among many insurers, thereby diluting their power, reimbursement rates may actually increase, which could lead to higher premiums for consumers.\" Exchanges clearly need to offer good choices, but that doesn't necessarily require choices by the boatload – not if there are several large nonprofits with their scaled purchasing power to cut costs to the insured.\n\nBill Barclay, DSA member and economist, reminds us of other factors that make health care uniquely unresponsive to typical market \"efficiencies.\" As the NYT article implies, none of us is an expert on purchasing health care, because (e.g.) we buy more TV sets in the course of our lives than we do bypass procedures. And improving our individual information base will be hard even with the help of health exchanges. Finally, health care has no saturation point for the individual; we always want to be healthier or less sick.\n\nTaking the profit out of health care provision will not solve all the problems of cost in the system, but it's a point of leverage that is already implicit in the ACA structure. We socialists can argue in favor of nonprofit insurers and providers as low-hanging fruit in achieving the medical loss ratios required, and point to the example of Germany's system for proof that that approach works. The ACA, though riddled with compromises and concessions to the industry, is improvable if not necessarily perfectible.\n\nThis approach, of course, is exactly what corporate conservatives and their low-information stooges have perennially been watching out for—\"creeping socialism,\" a suspected death-of-a-thousand-cuts for capitalism. Oddly, slow-walking public policy to the left is often dismissed on our side as too incremental. Socialism, we sometimes believe, has to arrive all at once... because the gradualist road to socialism often involves unpleasant disruption without the immediate, clear benefits that would sell the next step.\n\nA slow socialist path to a nonprofit core in health care may be the exception – steps that will each demonstrate the value of the process and sell the doubtful on taking another one. Sometimes it needs to creep. Health care is such a singularity, so different from any other \"market\" structure, that we shouldn't be surprised that the path to successful, truly *public* health care might be different too.\n\n[*The Politics of Media Conglomeration*](http://dsadc.org/the-politics-of-media-conglomeration/)\n\nMonday, December 3rd, 2012\n\n**A clear and present call to socialist action**\n\n**The *Washington Socialist* &lt;&gt;December 2012 **\n\n*By Carolyn M. Byerly\n*In a Nov. 26 article in *Truthout*, reporter Mike Ludwig asked whether the FCC will \"give Rupert Murdoch the powerful gift of media consolidation.\" The question is a deep and personal one for socialists, who are at the forefront of challenging the cancer of deregulation in the media industries. The media reform and justice movements challenging the corporate takeover of media emerged in 2003 with leadership from socialists like Bob McChesney, John Nichols and others, and it is those of socialist and feminist orientation who have continued to pound away at a seemingly un-giving wall of corporate power. I've been very involved in this movement, as I'll explain later.\n\nThis commentary pulls together a quick summary of the politics of media deregulation and then presents a clear and urgent call to action related to a measure presently before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Media conglomeration is about to get worse if the FCC has its way in what is widely believed to be a stealth plan to abandon the remaining cross-ownership rules that limit daily newspapers from owning radio stations in the same market. FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, an Obama appointee who is pro-business and anti-public interest, distributed an internal draft of the policy among commissioners in mid-November to prepare for a December vote. *No public input is being sought before that vote. *If passed, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation could begin to buy up radio stations in the same city where he already owns the daily newspapers.\n\nImagine a nation where Rupert Murdoch controls most of the means to communication. Socialists need to think beyond their own narrow reading tendencies here – consider the majority of the public who does not read *Mother Jones, Z Magazine, The Nation, In These Times, Dissent*, or listen to Democracy Now!\n\nThe background is this:\n\nUnder neoliberal national policies in the 1980s, US industries began to deregulate – a buzz word for conglomeration through mergers and acquisitions. I first saw this happening in the financial sector when my own locally-owned bank in Seattle was gobbled up by a big east coast financial institution. The same began happening in the media industries, as well, in the 1980s, something more relevant to freedom of expression. The thing for us to keep in mind is that neoliberalism has been the policy framework for both Republican and Democratic administrations since the 1980s under Reagan, with roots that go even farther back.\n\nA consummate neoliberal, Democratic President Bill Clinton gave us both NAFTA and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the second setting in motion a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the newspaper and telecomm world. To be sure, media ownership had begun to loosen under Reagan, so that by the early 1990s, hardly a major city still had two competing newspapers; those that did typically had one controlled by the other under a Joint Operating Agreement. But the \"T-'96\" as it came to be called, took away most of the prohibitions on the acquisition of smaller companies by the big corporations. Newspapers, book publishing companies, magazines, public relations firms, radio and television stations, cable, telephone companies, film companies and theaters soon were joined under ownership of a few huge parent companies.\n\nIn case the pattern here isn't perfectly clear, the ownership patterns in media conglomeration happened through both horizontal and vertical integration. Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has been a conglomerate that owned newspapers (horizontal integration), but now he's branched out into other forms of telecommunication companies and is drooling over the possibility the FCC will lift bans so he can go after radio next. Disney, on the other hand, has always moved along a vertical integration strategy, owning everything from film studios to the theaters those films show in, as well as other distribution outlets like TV stations (ABC, Disney Network, Disney Channels Worldwide), product merchandising and theme parks. Both News Corp and Disney are among the top five global media conglomerates, controlling not just the circulation of ideas and images, but also controlling politics through the fortunes each reaps through its multiple revenue streams.\n\nWe need to conjure up a few old wise old sages who reminded us long ago that those who control the means of production also control the ideas that circulate (Marx & Engels) and that women's ideas will never be heard so long as men own the newspapers (Susan B. Anthony).\n\nThe media conglomerates today have a race, gender, nationality and class profile, with controlling interests dominated by very, very wealthy white men who are based mainly in the United States. In his numerous books critiquing media conglomeration, Bob McChesney has observed that the nation has become both more conservative and more de-politicized under conglomerated media, which have weeded out all but vapid entertainment and pro-consumer content. Gone is investigative reporting, public affairs programming in broadcast, and a broader range of political discourse.\n\nOn Nov. 14, the Federal Communications Commission released its long-awaited report on broadcast ownership and it only confirmed the worst. The report shows that racial minorities presently own controlling interest in minuscule numbers of broadcast stations – 2.2 percent of full-powered television stations, 6.2 percent of AM radio stations, and 3.5 percent of FM radio stations. Females own controlling interest in only 6.8 percent of television stations, 7.8 percent of AM stations, and 5.8 percent of FM stations. The situation with minority ownership, particularly black radio, is particularly dire – the medium that has historically given the African American community the means to articulate its experiences, perspectives and culture – appears to be shrinking out of existence. This loss of voice represents both a civil rights and women's rights issue of deep and immediate concern to 12 percent of the nation's population, those who comprise the African American community, and the 51 percent who are female. Women should also consider that the low numbers of stations we own are mostly under single ownership (i.e., women tend to own only one or two stations) in rural or other minor market areas. Who speaks for us?\n\nThe sorry state of women's and minorities' broadcast ownership has been challenged in the courts. The Third Circuit Court rulings in the *Prometheus vs. the FCC* (2003) and *Prometheus II vs. the FCC* (2011) required the FCC to address the structural problems preventing women and people of color from owning and maintaining ownership of broadcast stations. In fact, both rulings directed the FCC to consider the 47 proposals to improve women and minority ownership that the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council (which represents minority broadcasters) put before the commission in 2003. The FCC has continually delayed in doing so.\n\nWhy should socialists – and feminists – be concerned about broadcast when we have the Internet and all those left-wing and women's publications? First, because the airwaves used in broadcasting are *owned by the public* and are supposed to operate in the public interest. At present, they do not. If we (the public!) don't demand they return to serve us, they will continue to serve mammon. We should also keep in mind that even Amy Goodman's and Juan Gonzales' Democracy Now!, which originates on WBAI-FM, New York, is *broadcast*, even though it can also be streamed via Internet.\n\nSecond, most people in the U.S. today listen to broadcast radio, not satellite or Internet radio, and they watch network (i.e., broadcast) television, not cable. While broadcast TV networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) are required to be carried by cable providers like Verizon, Comcast and Time Warner, millions of people who live in both urban and rural areas still get these networks through the traditional means – antennae. This is a class, race and gender issue since most of those who do not have cable are low-income men and women, and many are ethnic or racial minorities. Third, the ownership and control of broadcast stations is part and parcel of the larger issue of corporate media ownership, since all are presently dominated by those huge mega-corporations we mentioned earlier. There will never be a broader political spectrum of opinion available on the media unless ownership is diversified.\n\nStopping the cross ownership rules from being lifted is a step in the direction of a bigger struggle, but it's a step that those of us on the Left must take.\n\nSeveral of my colleagues at Howard University and I stepped into the ownership mess a few years ago by forming the Howard Media Group ([*www.howardmediagroup.org*](http://www.howardmediagroup.org)), with the commitment to give women and minorities a voice at the communications policy table. To date, we have submitted numerous comments during public proceedings, testified before the Commissioners, met with Media Bureau staff numerous times, and conducted research associated with media ownership and diversification. We have had a modicum of response, not the least of which was the adoption of our recommendation about four years ago that the Media Bureau develop an online reporting system for all stations, both full powered and low powered, and should report the data from those reports to the public. Stations, which are required to report every two years, have done so in both 2009 and 2011. The Nov. 14 ownership report is the first output from this change in procedures, and can be found at [*http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/*](http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/).\n\nThe FCC (www.fcc.gov) is a five-member body, with three commissioners representing the party in power (presently Demos) and two of them representing the minority party (the GOP). Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, an African American who has worked closely with the civil rights community, and Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who replaced that great champion of public interest, Michael Copps, last year when he retired, are presently the only two commissioners who can be counted on to speak up for the public interest. But public pressure has had some impact in the past and needs to be applied again now.\n\nI urge everyone who reads this article and takes its messages to heart to write even a short note to the FCC and urge them not to lift the cross-ownership rules. Your letter should reference this proceeding – **MB Docket No. 09-182, 2010 Quadrennial Review** – and addressed to:\n\nChairman Julius Genachowski Commissioner Robert McDowell Commissioner Mignon Clyburn Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel Commissioner Ajit Pai Federal Communications Commission 445 Twelfth Street, SW Washington, DC, 20054\n\nIf you want to see a sample letter on the subject, you can check out the one that our Howard Media Group filed last week at [*http://www.howardmediagroup.org/*](http://www.howardmediagroup.org/).

In that report, the US system came in at 37th, between Costa Rica (36<sup>th</sup>) and Slovenia (38<sup>th</sup>).\n\nTotal expenditure doesn't seem to be the issue. In 2007 the US spent 16% of it's GDP on health care, without covering everyone in the country. The number for France was 11%, for Germany it was 10.4%, for the UK 8.4%, for Japan it was 8.1% — and these countries cover their entire population or close to it.\n\nAccording to author T.R. Reid's *The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health*, the health care systems around the world can be divided among four major types:\n\n**The Beveridge model, or socialized medicine**\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Labour Party of the United Kingdom put into action the ideas of social reformer William Beveridge and created the National Health Service. Health care is provided by the government through tax payments like other public services such as education. Many, but not all, hospitals and clinics are owned by the government. These health-care systems tend to have lower costs because the governmentcontrols what the government can do and what they can charge.\n\nA number of countries use this type of system, including the UK, which is the 18<sup>th</sup>-best system in the world according the WHO report, and Spain, the 7<sup>th</sup> best. The Scandinavian social democracies and New Zealand also have this type of health care system. Cuba, number 39 according to the WHO, is another example. Ironically, capitalist Hong Kong has socialized medicine while the People's Republic of China does not.\n\n**Single-Payer model**\n\nSingle-payer, or Medicare for all, has been the goal of much of the American left since the times of FDR. Truman proposed this type of health care in the 1940's and Ted Kennedy was an advocate for much of his political career.\n\nOur neighbor to the north, Canada, has this type of system. In 1944, Tommy Douglas became the premier of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan and formed the first socialist government of a Canadian province. Douglas introduced single-payer health care to the province. Other provinces soon followed and eventually the federal government of Canada. According to the WHO it is the 30th best system in the world.\n\nSingle-payer uses private-sector providers but payment comes from a government-run insurance plan that every citizen pays into. Government negotiates lower prices, and as a result the same drugs in Canada are cheaper than in the US.\n\nIn the 1990's health experts from Taiwan looked at different health care systems and they decided that the single-payer was the one that suited their needs. It was used as the model for the health care system of the island.\n\n**Multi-Payer model**\n\nAfter the unification of Germany in 1871, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck feared the growing popularity of the German Social Democrats, the SPD. To win support from the working class, Bismarck began the creation of the first modern welfare state and the current German health care system.\n\nIn some superficial ways, the German system would seem similar to what many Americans already have through their jobs. The system is financed from deductions from employers and employees through payroll deductions. Unlike in the US, health insurance plans in Germany cover everybody and they don't make a profit. Tight regulation gives government much of the cost-control that single-payer models provide.\n\nGermany's system was considered by WHO to be the 25<sup>th</sup>-best system, but France, which also has a multi-payer system, was considered to be the best in the world. Japan's was 10th.\n\nGermany, the Netherlands and Switzerland have been studied by American health care experts who were looking for an alternative to single-payer, and proposals by the Clinton administration, the Heritage Foundation (a conservative think tank) and others have been partly based on this model. The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, itself owes some ideas to this model.\n\n**Out-Of-Pocket model**\n\nThe richest countries, except for the United States, have universal health systems, but many of the countries of the global South have no health systems or systems with huge gaps. Hundreds of millions never see a doctor. The poor who can save enough can see a doctor; otherwise they go without medical care.\n\nIn the US we have elements of all four models. Our veterans have socialized medicine through the VA. Our seniors have Medicare, a single-payer system, like Canada. A diminishing number of those who are employed full-time have insurance through their job, like in Germany. For too many in our country, the access to the health care system is not that much better than in developing countries and worse than in some Latin American countries.\n\n**Some observations**\n\nOne observation that should be made is that in Germany, the UK, Canada and other countries, the development of universal health care was a reaction to a rising socialist movement or one of the policies implemented by a socialist movement.\n\nSecondly, even though the multi-payer models superficially are similar to the US system now and under Obamacare, most of the basic benefits are provided by non-profits.\n\nThirdly, all of these countries, including the ones that have multi-payer systems, have all-payer regulations. Government bargains with health care providers such as doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies to set prices for medical goods and services. The prices agreed to are binding on all parties.\n\nIn the US, Medicare and Medicaid restrain costs, but there are no such restraints on the private sector. The state of Maryland has operated an all-payer system for hospitals since 1977 and has ~~since~~ seen costs rise more slowly than the national average.\n\nBob Kuttner outlines (see related article) the rampant commercialization of the US health care system, with medical expenditures leaking away into advertising and promotion, executive salaries and shareholder dividends. That for-profit activity, along with the lack of all-payer bargaining, help make US health care the world's least cost-effective. A shift to nonprofits as in France and Germany and broad negotiation of service and product costs can bring US health outlays, currently well above $2 trillion annually, into line while covering nearly everyone.\n\n[*Women Workers' Rights in Europe:*](http://dsadc.org/women-workers-rights-in-europe/)\n\nMonday, December 3rd, 2012\n\n**Glowing but Still Imperfect Models for the Rest of Us **\n\n**The *Washington Socialist* &lt;&gt;December 2012**\n\n*By Carolyn M. Byerly*\n\nIn the broader spectrum of workers' rights, where are women's? Do laws recognize women's rights to the same jobs that men hold, to the same pay that men get, and to accommodation for the biological realities associated with motherhood? Are women more equal as a result of laws?\n\nThese questions first came to me when I was doing research in Paris in the late 1980s. Across the street from my budget hotel on the Left Bank was a brick-front building that served as a public day care center. Both professional and working class parents and their pre-school children lined up each morning waiting for it to open, and each afternoon, parents came back to pick up their kids, who were always cheerful and sometimes carried pictures or something else they had made. It was an eye-opener as to how that European nation supported its working families.\n\nMore recently, I've had a chance to learn some of the answers to these bigger questions for nations in the European Union, in connection with a project I've been involved in as a contract researcher over these last months. The study is to learn how the EU's gender mainstreaming mandates have been enacted (or not) by media companies. (More detail follows later in the discussion.)\n\nWomen's employment rights became part of the European legal framework in the 1950s as nations began to incorporate anti-discrimination statements into their labor legislation, one aspect of embracing social democracy. For example, Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, which created the European Community (EC) – the forerunner of the European Union – required each member state to assure \"men and women should receive equal pay for equal work.\" Having an overarching political and legal structure from this time enabled women to begin working for broader applications of institutional change.\n\nActivism is what enabled the following events to occur. From the 1960s, feminist mobilization successfully coalesced into a global movement in Europe (as elsewhere). By the 1970s women were pushing for more specific laws and policies that affected the workplace, both within their own nations and at the regional (Euro) level. Legal suits brought by women contributed to their labor rights by establishing case law, as with the 1975 ruling by the European Court of Justice in *Defrenne II*, forcing European states to introduce equal pay legislation. That same year, the EC defined \"equal pay,\" applying it both to elements of work and to forms of remuneration (including benefits). A series of subsequent directives adopted by the EC in the 1970s and '80s added gender equality to employee training, social security benefits, and pensions.\n\nThe Nordic nations were among the first and most progressive in Europe to address gender equality. Norway, for example, enacted a national law on gender equality in 1979, which extended into labor and other aspects of civil society. Laws enacted in both Sweden and Norway from that period also created the \"ombudsman\" to monitor gender equality and human rights and to process complaints of discrimination. Today, national legislation also provides the most generous maternity and paternity benefits in Europe and mandates subsidized municipal child care centers for children up to school age. In Norway, mothers are presently given 14 weeks of leave at full pay, and both parents can share additional leave at partial pay; nursing mothers are given up to an hour a day to breast-feed their children. Under Finnish law, parents may stay at home with children up to age 3 and there is a monetary allowance for childcare. Employers are encouraged to allow parents to work part time until children are 7 years old.\n\nLike feminists in other western nations, European feminists worked together to create a structure for institutionalizing policies and practices. The creation of the European Women's Lobby (EWL) in 1987 by 17 organizations in 12 nations gained full legal standing under the EC in 1990, establishing offices and staff in Brussels ([*http://www.womenlobby.org/spip.php?rubrique43&lang=en*](http://www.womenlobby.org/spip.php?rubrique43&lang=en)). The EWL provided the structural mechanism for women to push quickly for workplace measures that became required for all EU member nations to incorporate into their laws. In 1992, for example, the Pregnant Workers' Directive was adopted, setting standards for maternity leave and pay, health and safety protections, paternity leave and pay, breastfeeding breaks, etc., across Europe.\n\nThat same year, the EU Council recommended that member states ask employers to support child care. Measures adopted in 1996 and 1997 expanded parental leave and part-time work requirements for employed parents. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted in 1990 makes gender equality a fundamental responsibility of all nations entering into the EU, and as amended in 2002, extends women's employment rights to promotion, vocational training, working conditions, social security and the right to return to her same (or equivalent) job after maternity leave.\n\nOne of the most far-reaching pieces of legislation was that to establish a European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). Proposed by the Swedish Minister for Gender Equality in 1999, and followed by years of planning, the EIGE ([*http://www.eige.europa.eu/*](http://www.eige.europa.eu/)) was formally created in 2010, with headquarters first in Brussels, then in Vilnius, Lithuania. The EIGE has authority to \"mainstream\" gender equality across the institutions of the EU nations, and also to monitor its progress. In the media sector, which I study and have had the most involvement with as regards EU activities, this includes eliminating sexist stereotypes and including more information about women in both news and entertainment media. In its monitoring role, the EIGE is presently conducting a major 28-nation study to determine whether media companies possess policies on gender equality, hire and promote women at the same rate as men, etc. But media are only one aspect of the EIGE's concerns.\n\nWe might ask whether and how all these progressive policies have affected women's employment and status in the EU.\n\nThe *Global Gender Gap Index*, published annually by the World Economic Forum, shows that in 2012, the Nordic countries are leaders in gender equality in education, high healthy life expectancies, and employment. The report ([*http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF\\_GenderGap\\_Report\\_2012.pdf*](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2012.pdf)) says, \"patterns vary across the Nordic countries, but, on the whole, these economies have made it possible for parents to combine work and family, resulting in high female employment participation rates, more shared participation in childcare, more equitable distribution of labor at home, better work-life balance for women and men and, in some cases, a boost to declining fertility rates\" (p. 22). The overall gender gap ratings among 134 nations place Iceland 1<sup>st</sup> (for the fourth consecutive year), Finland 2<sup>nd</sup>, Norway 3<sup>rd</sup>, and Sweden 4<sup>th</sup>. Ireland is 5<sup>th</sup> and Denmark 7<sup>th</sup>. Most of the remaining EU nations all rank above 20<sup>th</sup> place, though a few fall remarkably low: Bulgaria 52<sup>nd</sup>, Poland 53<sup>rd</sup>, Italy 80<sup>th</sup>, Greece 82<sup>nd</sup>. Hungary 81<sup>st</sup>, and Malta 88<sup>th</sup>. Canada and the United States placed 21<sup>st</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup>, respectively, with the U.S. ranking dropping 5 positions below 2011 (pp. 22-3).\n\nWhile these are the overall rankings that take a range of elements in well-being into consideration, the report for working women is less rosy. Denmark drops to 31<sup>st</sup> in wage equality, Ireland to 12<sup>th</sup>, Finland drops to 15<sup>th</sup>, Norway to 21<sup>st</sup>, and Sweden to 49<sup>th</sup>. Canada and the United States placed 35<sup>th</sup> and 61<sup>st</sup>, respectively in the wage equality category. It bears noting that while neoliberalism has invaded Canadian society since the 1980s, much as it has the rest of the world, the nation has been able to hang onto most of its pro-social democracy policies. Within that political-economy, Canada's women's movement was able to institutionalize laws and policies on gender equality that have remained intact.\n\nThere are three big lessons to be taken by women in the United States from this brief comparison of women's labor and other rights in Europe and North America. The first is that women would be wise to be bolder in our political visions, thinking more like social democrats (or rather democratic socialists, as we call ourselves in the US) to achieve a progressive legal framework for laws and policies governing labor and other rights. The second is to consider how to leverage more power, particularly in the workplace, by seeking leadership positions within labor unions. As I will explore in a future commentary, unions have not historically or presently always been the friend of working women, but there is potential for structural intervention by unions that can and should be serving women well. Third is to recognize that laws and policies alone will not stamp out the deeply imbedded (and unfortunately pretty universal) reality of male dominance. Beyond the legislatures and courts, this deeper malady has to be addressed in institutions where moral and attitudinal systems emerge: families, religions, schools, and the ever present cultural industries. I will also address this in future commentaries.\n\n*The International Labor Day Is Celebrated May 1*\n\nA Washington Socialist Report\n\nOn Tuesday, May 1st, a large contingent of DSAers participated in the largest May Day celebration the national capital has seen in years.\n\nAround 15 DC-DSA members of all ages gathered at Meridian Hill Park (often known by the Left as Malcolm X Park) in the early evening.

This is often startling to US workers, whether unionized or not. Every successful experiment in workers-corporation relations, however, can teach us something about how to advance our socialist goal. The strength of unions varies greatly from country to country and there is an interesting difference between the laws governing labor relations in the US and in the European Union. This note concentrates on the laws defining the structures and roles of workers in the European workplace. It is a translation of an article by J.P. Roulleau and Michele Millor reprinted by permission of the \"Institut Superieur du Travail\"*\n\n**&gt;&gt;Election by employees or nomination by the union? The implementation of employee representation in the enterprises shows a very large diversity from country to country in Europe. Each country responds differently and no trend is dominant.**\n\nWhat is the real source of legitimacy for a certain type of representation to be recognized in an enterprise? Is it the election by the wage-earners of an \"enterprise committee\" or the designation of a delegate by the union? Each country has its own response and no trend prevails. This is another difficulty of European social relations. Another problem underlies this question: what is the role of the representation — to contribute to the smooth functioning of the enterprise by helping to resolve difficulties that may occur, or to play the role of a critic, a challenger, and denounce the errors of management? Is the wage-earners' representation recognized as a partner with true rights, or does it play the role of critical opposition?\n\n**Single or Double Channel**\n\nThere are two situations in Europe:\n\n\\* The single channel. The union is the only authorized representative of the wage-earners. This is the case of Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, and Sweden.\n\n\\* The double channel with the coexistence within the enterprise of union representation and a form of representation elected by the wage-earners. It is the case in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n\nHowever, in both cases, the situation is evolving.\n\nOn one hand, in the \"single channel\" countries, elected committees appear. This is the case in Great Britain, but only on a voluntary basis. By contrast, in Hungary, a law adopted in 1992 theoretically requires the establishment of such committees, but the practice, it appears, is slow to conform to law. In the Czech Republic, if there is no union in the enterprise, these committees may be formed. They have a right of information, consultation, and eventually negotiation. On the other hand, in the \"double channel\" countries, the role and functions given to the union in the enterprise can differ greatly, from simple tolerance in Germany to the exclusive recognition of the right to conclude agreements in France.\n\nFinally, the ambiguity of the guidance — informational role, or consultation role? — risks further modifying the picture.\n\n**Closely Related Logic: Great Britain and Sweden**\n\n\\* Great Britain remains faithful to its liberal tradition \\[in the European, 19th-century sense\\]. The unions are the only representatives of the wage-earners' interests. It is up to them, by their weight, to impose themselves upon the employer as interlocutors. Tony Blair's government recently defined the procedures for the recognition of a union in an enterprise. The members of the union elect their representatives, the \"shop stewards,\" usually at the level of the workshop or of a department. Together the shop stewards may constitute a committee which has the right to negotiate once the union is recognized.\n\nIn other respects, in some enterprises, management has sometimes instituted committees which bring to mind our \\[French\\] enterprises committees. From one enterprise to another, their composition, their form, their role varies since they are, up to now, voluntary initiatives.\n\n\\* Sweden, particularly due to its unionization, chose to recognize the exclusive representation of the wage-earners through their unions, under various forms: union representatives, delegates for security and working conditions. Since the law of January 1, 1977, complemented by legislation enacted April 1982, the employer, before any important decision, must consult the union representatives and negotiate with them the modalities of the project. Few enterprises have retained an enterprise council where questions of common interest are discussed. These steps conform to the decentralization of negotiations, previously realized at the branch level and from now on returning to the enterprise level, but always through the union channel.\n\n**The German System**\n\n\\* Germany's system is the opposite. It follows very precise rules, defined by various laws, updated in 1972 and 1976. These regulations are perfectly accepted and integrated by all parties involved: by the enterprise, the employees, and the unions.\n\nThe enterprise council (Betriebsrat) has a monopoly for the employees' representation. This council, where the directors are excluded, elects its own president amongst its members, and represents an essential gear of industrial democracy. It is part of the joint management. It is the partner recognized by management as the unique voice of the wage-earners. These councils should exist in all enterprises with more than five persons. Elected for four years, they are totally independent. They don't receive any imperative mandate from the employees or from the union. They cannot be dissolved; their elected members are permanent with a number dependent on the size of the enterprise.\n\nTwo complementary and specialized structures complete the council:\n\n&gt; \"The delegation of young workers and apprentices\" composed of young workers, elected by wage-earners younger than 24, to represent the interests of this age group within the enterprise council. One of these delegates may attend the regular meetings. All the \"young delegates\" attend when the council discusses a question that concerns them.\n\n&gt; \"The economic council\" for enterprises of more than 100 persons. It includes members that are not elected but nominated by the council. In contrast with the enterprise council, the employer may participate in these meetings.\n\nThere are also what is called \"men of trust.\" Designated by the union, they have no representation role with the employer. They are in fact relays between union and wage-earners.\n\n\\* The German system has inspired the system implemented in Hungary. However, the enterprise committee's rights introduced by the 1912 \"Code du Travail\" are much less important than those of the German Betriebsrat.\n\n\\* Austria's system of representation is similar. The law of 1974 defines the functions of the enterprise council, with two distinct entities: a blue-collar council and a white-collar one. These two groups may elect a common council if two-thirds of the members want it.\n\n\n\n**Primacy of the Union**\n\nUnlike the example of Germany, integrated representation recognizes a certain primacy of the union structure.. In almost all these countries (Belgium, Luxemburg, France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal), it is the unions that establish the lists of candidates for the enterprise councils. France created a two-round process. For the first round, only the recognized unions may establish and present lists. If these lists don't receive a quorum, the wage-earners may then form \"free lists\" for a second round. In spite of these hurdles, the non-union lists are now getting almost one third of the enterprise council positions. Italy, since 1993, has also established an original system of representation. It tries to reconcile both sources of legitimacy. Two third of the positions are elected by the wage-earners on union lists, and the last third is filled equally by the three unions.\n\nReprinted by permission of the Institut Superieur du Travail, Paris Original at www.istravail.com/article285.html."},{"title":"Local Town Meeting on Ferguson, Mo.

Philip Randolph Institute) issued a unified action statement of 15 steps to promote reform and stop police abuse. Among these were calls for federal investigations and reviews by the Department of Justice, specifically on the killing of the unarmed Brown, and more generally on all police killings, as well as the use of excessive force and racial profiling. They noted that closing the gap on data collections to monitor these activities is essential. They also recommended the use by police officers of Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) and dash cameras in police vehicles. Calls for community policing were also heard.\n\nActivists of the civil rights movement in the '50s and '60s have been re-traumatized by Ferguson's example of federal military weapons in the hands of law enforcement – the militarization of the police. Particularly painful for older civil rights activists was the fact that Brown's body was left in the street for four hours, reminiscent of how people who were lynched were left in the streets.\n\nOf late, there seems to be incremental progress in some places in some of these arenas; for example, the Justice Department is moving forward with some investigations and locally DC will be testing body cameras.\n\nWhite DSAers need to reach out to our African American and Latino sisters and brothers about what we can do to help them achieve the goals they set forth as we all struggle for social justice.

Activities that will build on struggles engaged in – and victories won – during the past year. And it is important to note the nature of those victories; for they speak to the core values of the coalition – justice for workers. Over the past year, JwJ played an active, leading role in the successful fight for a wage theft law. Although wage theft (forcing people to work uncompensated overtime, not paying full wages due and the like) has always been technically illegal, previously there was no mechanism to allow those cheated to claim what had been stolen from them. Another important victory was DC City Council passage of a sick leave bill; meaning workers no longer can be fired for taking time off when ill – or when their children are sick, And a third victory was won with passage of a graded minimum wage increase, to be implemented over the next few years.\n\nGiven the realities of poverty and injustice within DC, however, JwJ is looking forward to greater gains in the future. Thus although DC — alongside Montgomery and Prince George' s County – was in the vanguard of the initial successful drive to increase local minimum wage in the absence of federal action (due to Republican recalcitrance) other cities have now taken that battle further by pushing for (and in some instances) winning an increase to $15. That number is now the local goal and a new campaign is underway to that end. So too is a campaign to include tipped employees, who labor with a minimum wage of $2.77 per hour. Because of the strength of restaurant and hotel industries in the District, these workers have been excluded from previous gains. JwJ is supporting a Restaurant Opportunities Center initiative to launch a public campaign to ensure that workers now excluded will be included in any future increase. JwJ is also supporting the work of Respect DC, which is fighting to improve pay and working conditions of Walmart workers, focusing at the two stores recently opened in Washington. And, in addition to supporting the efforts of coalition members, JwJ will soon announce the launch of a campaign of its own focusing on hours and schedule for the ever-growing number of contingent, part-time, sub-contracted workers that are features of our local (and of the national) economy.\n\nTwo members of DSA took part in the meeting.

Yet, it is not debated whether austerity is the way forward – the Labour and Conservative parties simply differ on the question of how fast to continue in that direction.\n\nLike DSA, the Labour Party is part of the Socialist International (SI) so this is a disappointment to DSA members.\n\nTravers and Hicks identified three events which will have profound impact over the next three years: (1) the September 18 Scottish independence referendum; (2) the British elections in 2015 (at the moment they think the Labor Party will narrowly edge out the Conservatives); and (3) a possible 2017 referendum about British membership in the European Union.\n\nParty loyalty has dropped sharply.

Of great concern is the rise and success of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) described in Wikipedia as a [*\"Eurosceptic right-wing political party\"*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party) advocating an exit from the UK's relations with the European Union and a five-year moratorium on immigration. Their policies essentially make them the British ideological equivalent of the Tea Party in the U.S. although they operate as a separate party in a parliamentary system.\n\nOne of the three major events Travers and Hicks discussed – the September 18 referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom – has since resulted in a \"no\" vote for independence. The professors predicted that this would be the case, as well as the very close vote. They also predict that once the older, post-World War II generation literally dies out, younger generations of Scottish voters will vote in an independent Scotland.\n\nFor now, those interested in British politics should keep a keen eye on the future, more incremental steps toward greater power for Scotland and the ripple effect this has on the UK as a whole, and to the upcoming 2015 elections and the role of UKIP as it potentially gains previously \"safe\" Labour seats.","order":2},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—October 2014 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"October 2014","order":-1,"date":"2014-10-02","body":"**Welcome to the October 2014 edition of *The Washington Socialist*, the online newsletter of the DC Metro Democratic Socialists of America.**\n\nWhat with all contributors still breathing hard after that doorstop [*Labor Day issue*](http://meetup.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=f80460413a&e=003de9ccab) that you probably haven't finished reading yet, this is a terse and newsy newsletter this month, mostly about everyday stuff.

No doubt in part to recruit new members at the march, but also in response to the growing gravity of global climate change and emerging popular movements to stop it (or at least slow its advance), many different currents on the U.S. left have recently been addressing climate change and environmental crisis. Here are the platforms and/or statements of several groups, \"ecosocialist\" and otherwise, that DSA supporters should find worth considering.\n\n\"Our Planet, Our Movement,\" from *Against the Current*, newsletter of the Trotskyist group Solidarity. Not only the growing climate crisis, but also number of other environmental indicators show our current civilization to be unsustainable, the editors of *Against the Current* warn. Added scientific research and technological innovation is needed to head off catastrophe, yet \"green capitalism\" cannot provide a real solution in the end. Socialist transformation will ultimately be required. In the meantime, however, \"the crisis cannot 'wait for the revolution' if we're going to avoid the collapse that could well become irreversible — according to a mounting mass of scientific evidence — within a few decades.\"\n\nArguing that \"the struggles to halt environmental destruction and capitalism itself must be waged simultaneously, and inextricably,\" *Against the Current* goes on to address the essential role of organized labor in the fight for sustainability as well as the painful dilemmas of workers who are currently employed by industries contributing to climate catastrophe. The statement goes on to provide electronic links to leftist activists who have proposed ways to address the economic needs of coal miners, auto workers and other employees of such anti-green industries while working to achieve the long-term solidarity needed to make climate activism successful. To access the statement, click here: [*http://solidarity-us.org/site/node/4233*](http://solidarity-us.org/site/node/4233).\n\nHowie Hawkins, Green Party Platform for Governor of New York. In the Sept. 21 People's Climate March, supporters of the New York Green Party and Howie Hawkins' campaign for governor were easy to identify from their bright green shirts, and in certain stretches along the route, there seemed to be a lot of them. Hawkins and the New York Green Party have an elaborate political platform addressing many urgent issues of importance to the left, with planks on raising the minimum wage, reinvesting in public housing, providing better mass transit for all New Yorkers, preserving net neutrality, resisting efforts to privatize public education, and many other issues besides.\n\nIn addressing environmental problems, Hawkins and the New York Greens identify several priorities, including a Green New Deal for the state, a ban on fracking and the closing of existing nuclear power plants, the achievement of a zero-carbon emissions energy system by 2030 in part through subsidies for distributed power systems and small-scale solar and wind power, a phasing out of large animal feedlots, the labeling of GMOs in food, a ban on antibiotics in animal feed, a ban on neonicotinoid pesticides that contribute to Colony Collapse among bees, and efforts to support small farmers in New York State through restrictions of corporate acquisition of farm land and economic and technical assistance for small producers.

Fred Magdoff, a long-time leftist with close ties to the Monthly Review school of Marxism, also is a professor emeritus of plant and soil science at the University of Vermont and has written frequently in MR on environmental topics, including the ecology of nutrient circulation within healthy soils. He is author of the Monthly Review Press book *What Every Environmentalist Needs to Know About Capitalism.* In this article, Magdoff focuses heavily on capitalism's addiction to exponential economic growth and the incompatibility of such growth with environmental sustainability. In a green and socially just economy, he writes, \"Once socially determined basic human needs (material and non-material) are met – and after deciding how much is enough – the economy stops growing with only neutral or positive side effects for society.\"\n\nSome other principles in Magdoff's list include creating a society of small, relatively self-sufficient communities, having workplaces and residences be closer so as to minimize transportation needs, moving towards a more bicycle-friendly society, and agricultural production \"based on soil and above-ground habitat management\" that makes plants better able to defend themselves against insects and disease. In Magdoff's ideal society, \"integrated animal-crop farms will be encouraged,\" with farm animals treated humanely and their manure, along with human wastes to the maximum degree feasible, being recycled back to the soil. The green society also will require shorter average work weeks, the elimination of planned waste in the economy, much greater income equality, and an education system that encourages compassion, cooperation, reciprocity and sharing, egalitarianism and a reverence for the natural world rather than their opposites. At WS press time Magdoff's article is available for free at [*http://links.org.au/node/4078*](http://links.org.au/node/4078).\n\n\"Change the System, not the Climate,\" from the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy & Socialism. This is a 28-page booklet produced collectively by some 24 different CCDS members, with 15 pages devoted to a somewhat scholarly overview of current climate trends and a discussion of economic and technological forces driving them. Unfortunately the text is not free of typos, but the booklet is visually appealing with some striking photographs and charts. Sources cited include Bill McKibben's .350 org, NASA, the IPCC, the Royal Society of London and the International Energy Agency, along with Al Gore and Marx.\n\nAmong the recommendations in the final section of the booklet are support for a global fossil fuels divestment campaign, as endorsed by McKibben and Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, among others; a focus on green job creation, as proposed at the World Congress of the International Trade Union Confederation in May 2014; radical reductions in the U.S. military budget to free up money for investment in green jobs, and \"social control of capital up to and including nationalization of the energy and finance sectors of the economy.\" CCDS lists several more immediate priorities as well, including fights against tar sands oil production and natural gas fracking and the promotion of organic agriculture. The booklet briefly endorses the Green Party's \"Green New Deal\" also, including its call for a carbon use tax coupled with \"robust\" efforts to protect the incomes of working class and poor people who would otherwise be hurt by such a tax. Single copies are available for $2.50 apiece, with cheaper rates for bulk orders, from CCDS Treasurer, 6422 Irwin Ct., Oakland, CA 94609.\n\n\"Capitalism, Socialism, and Sustainability,\" by Mark Schaeffer of DSA. As posted by Mark Schaeffer to DSA activists before the Sept. 21 climate march, this outlines a possible democratic socialist approach to tackling global environmental crisis while also addressing growing economic inequality. It can be printed out as a four-page 11.5\" by 8\" brochure for ease of distribution to other marchers.\n\nOn one point, the DSA brochure is arguably contradictory: it quotes a warning from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. against civilizations collapsing by deciding to make necessary changes \"too late,\" yet in another passage it states that a socialist society can be achieved through nonviolent struggles, \"continuing over generations,\" to expand democratic rights, institutions, and social relations \"within a mainly capitalist system.\" The brochure adds, \"These centuries-long struggles continue in our time on many fronts...' Whether most green activists believe the fight to curb climate change can extend over \"generations\" and \"centuries\" without producing global catastrophe is unclear. The bulk of the brochure, however, outlines a number of paths to a green future that socialists can pursue immediately. Stating that \"business as usual is leading toward catastrophic collapse of the natural systems that billions of people depend on for their livelihood,\" Schaeffer writes that achieving a sustainable economy will require \"fundamental political and social change on every scale from household to planet,\" adding: \"System change can only be achieved by uniting movements for social justice, peace, and human rights as well as environmental justice and stewardship.\"\n\nIssues around which such activists can unite, the brochure indicates, include the creation of green jobs, especially through government-funded modifications to existing infrastructure; the fight for fair trade; the uprooting of environmental racism so that minority communities are not forced to be dumping grounds for toxic waste; campaigns for reproductive choice and access to family planning; fights for healthier workplaces; reductions in the working week and year; expanding and improving public transit; democratic local and regional planning; improved public education; the promotion of \"diverse forms of economic democracy\" including co-ops, worker-owned enterprises and community-owned agriculture; and campaigns to block fossil fuel and other hazardous technologies, including via divestment campaigns. \\[*Editor's note: on Sept. 30 Schaeffer sent some updates to the DSA Activist list for inclusion in future versions. Those changes may be included in the document referenced here by the time readers see this article.*\\]\n\nTo access the brochure, click here: [*http://www.dsausa.org/capitalism\\_socialism\\_and\\_sustainability*](http://www.dsausa.org/capitalism_socialism_and_sustainability).\n\n[*GOOD READS FOR SOCIALISTS OCTOBER 2014*](http://dsadc.org/good-reads-for-socialists-october-2014/)\n\nWednesday, October 1st, 2014\n\n\n\n***The Washington Socialist*&lt;&gt;October 2014**\n\nSometimes the most interesting phenomenon is the good read that pops up in the MSM, or mainstream media as the slang puts it.

From the Reagan-era tax cuts to the bailout of the financial sector following the 2008 crash, the elite has used its wealth to make sure it reaps most of the benefits of economic growth and suffers no harm when the economy goes sour. Corporate America spreads its influence chiefly through generous campaign contributions to Republicans and Democrats alike, ensuring that its interests remain the highest priority of U.S. policymaking.\n\nCorporate money has long dominated U.S. politics, but the Supreme Court's 2010 *Citizens United* decision took the lid off, allowing corporations to make unlimited contributions to allegedly \"independent\" political groups that, in reality, are almost always aligned with one or another political party or candidate. The decision was based on past jurisprudence holding that corporations are legal persons with First Amendment rights. Therefore, Faux says, we need to amend the Constitution to declare that corporations are *not* persons, something that would overturn *Citizens United* and allow the government to regulate corporate campaign contributions or ban them outright.\n\nCertainly such an amendment, if it could be passed (not an easy task) would be a step in the right direction, but would it be enough? Even before Citizens United, corporate money flowed freely into politics. Even though direct corporate spending for partisan purposes was limited, corporations were skilled at \"bundling\" contributions, in which corporate executives collected numerous funds from their managers, other employees, shareholders, etc. and presented them in a \"bundle\" so that the candidates would have no doubt to whom they were beholden. Eliminating corporate personhood wouldn't touch this practice.\n\nNearly every attempt at regulating campaign spending has resulted in a \"balloon effect\" – squeeze one part of the balloon and the air swells in another part. Shut off one path of campaign contributions, and corporations will find another conduit for the money. Even before *Citizens United*, the effectiveness of \"clean election\" laws adopted in several states – in which campaigns could receive public funding in exchange for accepting only small contributions – was limited by the ability of corporations and other interest groups to bundle contributions. And, since *Citizens United*, their ability to regulate campaign spending has eroded even further.\n\nIf progressives choose to go the difficult route of a constitutional amendment, why not take it one step further and declare that money is not speech? This would cut to the heart of the difficulty of limiting campaign spending and contributions. There is a false presumption that the First Amendment free-speech guarantee should apply to the \"volume\" of speech in addition to the \"content\" of speech. Therefore, while a major corporation and I may both be able to express our preference for a candidate, the corporation's ability to funnel millions into the campaign trumps my ability to write a modest check. Instead of parsing whether the source of money flowing into campaigns is corporations or individuals, or whether it is \"campaign\" or \"independent\" money, strict limits on campaign-related contributions and spending by any and all entities or persons – coupled with full public financing of campaigns — would go farther in getting cash out of politics. A constitutional amendment and its implementing legislation could be tailored to address only genuine campaign spending and not, for instance, restrict the ability of media outlets to endorse a candidate.\n\nIn the end, however, no matter what solutions we may think up for ending the corrupting influence of money on our economy, nothing will change without a strong left movement to force these solutions onto the agenda. There is no substitute for the hard, day-to-day work of movement-building – the kind of work Democratic Socialists of America is carrying out every day.","order":3},{"title":"Maryland Ballot Measures highlight Same-Sex Marriage, Gambling","date":"2012-09-30","issue":"October 2012","author":"","body":"**Maryland Ballot Measures highlight Same-Sex Marriage, Gambling**\n\nCarolyn M. Byerly\n\nMaryland voters will have (at least) two hot-button measures to decide in November that merit a Democratic Socialist perspective.\n\n**From the October issue of *The Washington Socialist***\n\n**Civil marriage for same-sex couples referendum in Maryland**\n\nThe newly passed law allowing same-sex marriage, set to take effect in January 2013, will actually not take effect in this state unless voters approve it on November 6. \"Question 6\" (see language below) will ask voters to say yes or no to whether gay and lesbian couples should be allowed to obtain a civil marriage license. The law, passed narrowly in the 2012 session of the Maryland State Assembly and signed into law by Governor O'Malley, was only able to get through the House and Senate by the addition of Section 5 requiring the referendum.\n\nThe Democratic left should view the Maryland law as an extension of basic human and civil rights, as well as a move to expand gender equality. Sexual minorities do not presently have the same economic and political rights as heterosexuals in the United States. If allowed to marry, same-sex couples would gain certain benefits under the Maryland state tax code, in health care decisions, and a number of other areas of the law. Equality Maryland, the state's gay rights lobby, has led the campaign for this measure in Maryland. These are personal matters to me. My partner Kay and I celebrate our 28<sup>th</sup> anniversary in October. We are just updating our wills and health care benefits to cover matters that married straight couples get automatically. Our lack of legal status persists in spite of our commitment and shared happiness.\n\nOpposition to same-sex marriage both nationally and locally has come mainly from conservative Christian groups and segments of the African American community (including some church leaders), who together were able to push through the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996 that defines marriage as the union between a man and a woman. This year has seen a dramatic shift, however. First, President Obama instructed the Justice Department to stop enforcing the law, which he said was unconstitutional. His announcement was followed by an announcement by the NAACP that it would support same-sex marriage. That political sea change will hopefully open the chances of broad statutory changes at the national level. Locally, in late September, Rev. Al Sharpton and several Black Maryland ministers joined to support the referendum. The Rev. Delman Coates of Clinton was reported in the Sept. 21 *Washington Post* as saying, \"As African-American Christian pastors and leaders, we cannot stand on the side of those who attempt to justify legalized discrimination under the guise of religious belief.\"\n\nWith no national law in sight, the gay community's strategy has been to push state by state. Maryland has followed six other states (Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont) and the District of Columbia in passing its same-sex marriage law. We should take note that two Native American Nations – Cherokee and Chippewa – also have same-sex marriage laws. The nations of Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and Sweden have federal laws allowing same-sex couples to marry.\n\n**Ballot Language**\n\nQuestion 6\n\n*Establishes that Maryland's civil marriage laws allow gay and lesbian couples to obtain a civil marriage license, provided they are not otherwise prohibited from marrying; protects clergy from having to perform any particular marriage ceremony in violation of their religious beliefs; affirms that each religious faith has exclusive control over its own theological doctrine regarding who may marry within that faith; and provides that religious organizations and certain related entities are not required to provide goods, services, or benefits to an individual related to the celebration or promotion of marriage in violation of their religious beliefs.*\n\nEven with this momentum, conservative groups have promised to flood the airwaves with ads opposing approval of the law. Marylanders for Marriage Equality, the advocacy group safeguarding the passage of the referendum, is sponsoring phone banks in the DC-Metro area these next weeks.

The legislation was presented as an omnibus bill to be considered in its entirety so that the whole package could either be passed or killed at once. The measure must now be put before Maryland voters before it becomes law. If passed, it will authorize table games (e.g., roulette, blackjack, craps), increase the number of lottery machines from 15,000 to 16,000, increase the number of video lottery machines allowed to operate in the state, allow a casino to be built in Prince George's County (probably at National Harbor), reduce taxes on casino owners, and expand casino hours of operation to 24/7.\n\nThe lawmakers who voted for the bill argued that expanding gambling would raise revenues for education in the state. Because state funding for public education, k-12 as well as colleges, has been in short supply these last years, this argument has resonated with many. Others supporting gambling (euphemistically called gaming these days) have bought the claims by the casino industry that it will create 12,000-20,000 new jobs, expand construction, and bring other great gifts to the state. Those who oppose it, led by contractors and citizen groups, deny there will be financial benefits. They point out that deals have been made to allow casino owners to circumvent the bidding process on construction, and they remind voters that tax increases for the state's residents were passed in the same year that the gambling bill was passed giving reduced taxes to casinos. The advertising campaigns on both sides of this issue are filling prime-time television ad slots, with more than $18 million already spent by opposing sides, according to recent news reports.\n\nDemocratic socialists should raise a number of pointed concerns, beginning with the political economy of gambling. Gambling – lotteries, horse racing, casinos, etc. – exploded in the last half of twentieth century America, always with the rationale that it would bring needed revenues to communities or, in some cases, to the state as a whole. None of this escapes the fact that the gaming industry is big business that represents another example of how the 1% dominates 99% of the population. The *Baltimore Sun* estimates that the gaming industry spent close to $4 million to \"lobby\" through the new Maryland law this last year and will spend millions more to persuade voters to vote yes on Question 7 through media campaigns this fall. Instead of invoking government administrative mechanisms to find ways to trim budgets, or using the legislative process to more fairly distribute the burden of taxation across income levels, the business community has advocated an economic model guaranteed to serve its own interests at the expense of those in lesser income categories. This last statement refers to those in middle and lower income levels who make up the majority of the patrons in the gaming industry. My local wine and beer store, which sells lottery and other tickets, is clogged with low-income people standing in line to buy them every afternoon. It's their money, but it's my leftist consciousness that makes me question whom that money really serves best.\n\nState Delegate Joseline Peña-Melnyk of Prince George's County made this statement in her most recent newsletter *Grassroots Beat* to her constituents: \"As I did in 2007, I was proud to cast a principled vote against expanding gambling in the State. Gambling disproportionately burdens our least well-off citizens and families, and pulls money out of our local economy. There are more responsible ways to manage the State's budget.\" A Democratic socialist analysis would lead to a no vote on Question 7.\n\n**Question 7**\n\n**Gaming Expansion Referendum**\n\n**Gaming Expansion (Ch. 1 of the Second 2012 Special Session)**\n\n*Do you favor the expansion of commercial gaming in the State of Maryland for the primary purpose of raising revenue for education to authorize video lottery operation licensees to operate \"table games\" as defined by law; to increase from 15,000 to 16,500 the maximum number of video lottery terminals that may be operated in the State; and to increase from 5 to 6 the maximum number of video lottery operation licenses that may be awarded in the State and allow a video lottery facility to operate in Prince George's County?*","order":4},{"title":"Socialist FAQ","date":"2012-09-30","issue":"October 2012","author":"Coleson Breen","body":"**From the October issue of *The Washington Socialist***\n\nWhat is Democratic Socialism?

Byerly","body":"**From the October issue of *The Washington Socialist***\n\nIn mid-September, the Marikana platinum miners' strike in South Africa ended when workers accepted a 22% pay raise and other compensations and agreed to return to work. The Marikana mine, north of Johannesburg, is operated by the Lonmin Company. Now, unrest has spread to the gold industry, with workers at the AngloGold Ashanti Kopanang mine beginning their own strike on Sept. 20. The mine employs 5,000 people and produces about 4% of the company's total gold output. In all, some 15,000 gold miners remained on strike in late September (at this writing). Those at the Gold Fields near Carletonville wanted a salary of 12,500 Rand per month, the equivalent of $1,500. They presently make a third of that. Mine officials say they can't afford to pay them such high wages.\n\nSouth Africa's economy has long depended on minerals and diamonds for its base. The nation has the world's largest reserves of manganese and platinum group metals, and among the largest reserves of gold, diamonds, chromite ore and vanadium. But these industries, still mostly white-owned, have long depended on the exploited laboring classes of indigenous Africans for their output. Over the decades, both before and after the end of apartheid, owners have been ruthless in keeping miners underpaid and under control; police have always been mine owners' allies, even today with a black majority police force. In the Marikana strike, which began Aug. 10 when rock drillers walked off the job, police fired on a crowd of strikers, killing 34 protesters and injuring another 78; a total of 45 people died in the end, including 3 policemen. The South African government and the international community are referring to this as the Marikana Massacre, and President Zuma has sworn there will be a thorough investigation.\n\nOne complication is that miners complain that the National Union of Mine Workers (NUM) doesn't represent them adequately anymore. Miners have accused the NUM leaders of being cozy with the mine owners and not caring about the low pay and unsafe working conditions they labor under in the mines. Black South African Cyril Ramaphosa, one of the nation's richest men today, owns about 10% of the Marikana mine and is the person whom workers have alleged sold them out in negotiations with their union. Ramaphosa, who was a founder of the NUM and its first general secretary, as well as a high-ranking ANC activist and colleague of Mandela, is seen as betraying the miners now. Under apartheid, the NUM was among the most \"organized\" elements of the internal coalition fighting against repression. Ramaphosa recently went on the South African airwaves and gave newspaper interviews denying these allegations and implied that, in fact, he fought for miners' benefits.\n\nThe degree of solidarity among striking miners in different mineral industries across the nation appears to strengthen the chances of them succeeding in securing wage increases and certain other monetary compensation. Less discussed are the deplorable conditions in which they work – unsafe and filthy worksites, long hours, etc.\n\nThe Marikana strike, which began as a wildcat protest on Aug. 10 and over the next days turned into a blood bath, is being compared to the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960 when more than 5,000 residents of the Sharpeville Township gathered at the police station to state they were refusing to carry their passbooks (required ID for Blacks and Coloreds under apartheid). Police fired into the crowd, killing 69 and injuring another 180. The two events are really not alike – in Sharpeville, Africans were demanding basic rights, in the Marikana strike, miners were demanding a fair wage and working conditions. But both seem to represent a turning point. In the first case, Sharpeville represented the beginning of the end of apartheid; Marikana represents what the *Nation* has called a wake-up call that South Africans are losing faith in the liberation movement they worked for.\n\nFor those us leftists looking in from afar, the lesson is that workers' rights (and other labor issues) are central democratic issues not to be lost track of after the revolution. Without economic justice for these miners, there is no democracy. We cannot intervene in these events directly, but by supporting miners' and other laborers'rights here in our own country, we can hopefully strengthen the broader labor network worldwide.\n\n\\[Details in this article were drawn from the *Nation, Huffington Post*, BBC online, and other websites.\\]","order":7},{"title":"Ideas on Giving $ to Candidates","date":"2012-09-30","issue":"October 2012","author":"Daniel C.

These periodic transportation bills provide not only funding for construction and upkeep of the nation's transportation systems, but also provided an opportunity for re-thinking and reforming the federal approach to transportation policy. In passing the landmark 1991 transportation bill, for example, Congress finally recognized that continual highway-building was not the solution to mobility and finally gave transit its due as a critical part of the transportation mix.\n\nUnfortunately, the new bill represents a step backward in almost all issues important to progressives: supporting transit, reducing greenhouse gases, and securing equitable funding for transportation programs. The bill was an awkward compromise between a reasonably progressive Senate bill and a rabidly pro-highway, anti-transit House bill. Both sides swallowed their principles to push this ugly baby into the world, less out of a spirit of bipartisan compromise than to make sure the backhoes keep running — laying new highway miles and preserving jobs – in members' districts.\n\nThe flaws of the bill are numerous, especially given the need to promote transportation policy that reduces dependency on the auto and attacks greenhouse gas emissions. Like most recent transportation legislation, this one is much too highway-centric. It provides no added funding for mass transit, makes severe cuts to programs to promote biking and walking, and fails (once again) to ensure that drivers bear something closer to the full cost that cars impose on the environment. The federal gas tax remains stuck at 18.4 cents per gallon, where it has been since 1993. A modest increase in the gas tax could pay for expanded transit and smart-growth programs *and* for repair of highways and bridges – but, unfortunately, requiring people to pay more for gas has become the third rail of transportation politics.","order":9},{"title":"The good news is that the current bill expires in 27 months.

As all the dead-tree newspaper organizations contracted viciously in the clutches of the recession and the competition from free Web news, the *WaPo* trimmed local coverage (simply THE franchise for any paper except the *NYT* and *WSJ*) and it became clear that the *WaPo* never had the institutional resilience to outclass the likes of Yahoo's and Google's online news aggregation.\n\nThe crash of the traditional news business is a minor tragedy for those of us who grew up holding a broadsheet paper out as far as our arms would reach. But it has provided a test of actual news practices that some have passed considerably better than others. *The New York Times,* to take the most obvious example, is still a mainstream newspaper, but has shown the breadth and depth to just plain be *better* than online news. Others haven't. But what does \"quality news\" mean for a radical?\n\nNow, as socialists, we pay attention to what's *excluded* in any news-play scheme. The *NYT* surpasses the *WaPo* on depth and context in most cases, but both have pretty explicit boundaries for what Ed Herman and Noam Chomsky (in *Manufacturing Consent*) called \"the limits of thinkable thought.\"\n\nWatching the BBC (the US report, but especially the weekly \"Newsnight\" panel show) or reading the *Guardian* reminds us that there's an English-language tradition of looking critically at the cash-nexus culture under whose yoke we suffer. For our media, though, that cash-nexus culture is the river in which we, and the reporters and editors, swim, and it's almost never penetrated, let alone questioned, in widely available public discourse.\n\nThose of us who have been around a few decades know that the center of mainstream, status quo economics has shifted far to the right since the Reagan-Thatcher years. There are mainstream writers – several, even, in the *WaPo* – who fashion at least a coherent defense against the prevailing unwisdom that makes up that river. The *WaPo*'s Ezra Klein and, in the business section, Steven Pearlstein consistently deflate the myths that are trafficked by the right-wing economists who (we must sadly note) are so much in the ascendant now that even a Democratic administration kowtows to the bond vigilantes and the confidence fairy. Pearlstein's excellent satiric portrait of the self-important, entitled-feeling \"job creator\" yesterday (Sunday, Sept. 30) is a good example of myth-deflation.\n\nAnd the phrases \"bond vigilante\" and \"confidence fairy\" will tip you off right away that Paul Krugman ranks in this corner as first among equals in this pantheon of liberal economists and business writers who keep the foam-flecked right at bay (though not in retreat). Coach K is often joined in this group by NYT colleagues David Leonhardt, NYT bureau chief in DC and former economics writer, and even by Joe Nocera, who is still trying to live up to his elevation from business scribe to august columnist-about-everything. Among the NYT's economics writers, as distinct from columnists, Louis Uchitelle remains the gold standard for stretching the parameters of the status quo and linking evidence of social inequality to evidence of standard capitalist practices untempered by regulation.\n\nBut even Krugman is doing economics within the \"limits of thinkable thought\" of US economics. The envelope of possibilities outside our borders is already well-enlarged, and sharp analysts like Reuters' Chrystia Freeland are able to range much more widely among the choices unconstrained by what used to be called the \"Washington Consensus.\" Greek and Spanish workers and consumers, chafing under the heel of the imported German variety of that consensus, would be more likely to call it the \"Washington Curse.\"\n\nAmong these overseas observers, some genuinely radical notions can emerge. It's remarkable to note that *The Economist* is considered the voice of responsible corporate conservatism in that much more spacious realm of discourse. In the US, of course, we have to find our radical economists in the pages of *The Nation* or *Mother Jones*, or at our hometown Economic Policy Institute—not in the MSM, generally. When radical economists do appear in the big papers they are outliers, or awarded a one-off to promote a book. But the general tenor of economic and business opinion is represented by writers like the *WaPo*'s Robert Samuelson, who earns his lunch asking why anyone would doubt the deficit hawks and posing bogus questions about the status quo that get oiled-up answers.\n\nThis quick look, limited to the writer's experience, needs to be augmented by comments from the readers.

(London and New York, Verso, 2011), $49.95 HB.**\n\nFor a number of leading Western leftists who have pondered the fate of socialism since the Russian Revolution, the performance of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) from the mid-1940s through the early 1980s has been a source of hope and inspiration. For several decades, before its leadership voluntarily dissolved the organization in 1991 to form a new \"Democratic Party of the Left\" that has since partly disappeared in the shuffle of Italian politics, the PCI seemed to be the subject of a left-wing Cinderella story.\n\nNearly wiped out by Mussolini's fascism in the 1920s, the party recovered rapidly in numbers and political clout following Mussolini's fall and by 1946 had some 2 million members, making it one of the largest Communist parties in the world at the time. Although (or because) its leaders gradually weaned themselves from uncritical admiration for the Soviet Union over the decades, the PCI by the 1970s was able to command roughly 25 percent of the Italian vote, and in the election of 1984 it received more than 33 percent of the votes cast, giving it the most votes of any Italian party that year.\n\nThanks in part to its loyal membership base, in part to its flexibility and its willingness to formulate a distinct \"Italian road to socialism\" that promised to respect electoral politics and democratic rights while pushing for radical economic change, the PCI by the 1970s was considered a leader in what was known as \"Eurocommunism,\" a movement that positioned itself to the left of established social democratic parties yet while embracing a commitment to representative politics as opposed to Soviet-style authoritarianism. Accordingly, the party increasingly attracted the interest of influential leftists, both inside and outside of the international Communist movement.\n\nBy the late 1980s, DSA's co-founder Michael Harrington was among those democratically inclined Marxist thinkers who looked to the writings of Antonio Gramsci, a PCI leader who did most of his most influential theoretical work in Mussolini's prison system in the 1930s, for ideas on how strong socialist movements might best survive under basically \"non-revolutionary\" conditions in the affluent capitalist West.\n\nToday, too, there is a revived interest in Gramsci's ideas within the U.S. left, as DSA activists (among others) look to his writings on socialist strategies of \"counter-hegemony\" and the gradualist \"war of position\" (as opposed to an insurrectionary \"war of maneuver\") for clues on how American progressives can avoid the likely pitfalls of a politics of revolt while also shunning a politics of compromise and accommodation with capitalist austerity politics – a trap that has caught all too many European social democratic parties in recent decades.\n\nThere has been considerable interest on the American left, therefore, in Lucio Magri's 2011 book *The Tailor of Ulm,* which despite its full title is largely an account of the PCI's political rise and eventual fall, as seen by a former dissident member of the party.\n\nMagri, at one time somewhat close to the PCI's top leadership, was temporarily expelled in 1968 for joining with several comrades in publishing an independent critical journal, *Il Manifesto,* yet he apparently remained supportive of the PCI and concerned about its fortunes for long afterwards.\n\nIn 1991, he reacted very negatively to the party's leadership dropping the word \"Communist\" from the organization's name and rebranding it as the new Democratic Party of the Left – a change, Magri writes, that led to the resignation of about one-third of the members at the time. In the early 1990s Magri was involved for a least some period in the launching of a \"Refoundationist\" Communist group that attempted to revive the PCI's old reputation for militancy. And in *The Tailor of Ulm*, he attempts to reconstruct a history of what the PCI did well and what it did less successfully over the decades leading to its dissolution.\n\nDSA members and other American progressives with a real interest in and some prior knowledge of the twists and turns of Marxist and socialist politics in the twentieth century will find much in *The Tailor of Ulm* that is fascinating, or at the very least, memorable.\n\nFor example, Magri's view of how the Truman administration contributed to the launching of the Cold War shortly following the end of World War II should trigger lasting second thoughts among reflexively anti-Communist Americans who have grown up believing that Stalin's ambitions in Eastern Europe were primarily responsible for the dramatic break between the major capitalist democracies and a Stalinist USSR that had contributed some 20 million lives and suffered huge losses in agricultural and industrial productivity to help the Allies win the war against Nazi Germany.\n\nHowever ruthless Stalin was capable of being, Magri, argues, the Soviet Union in 1946 was still suffering heavily from the war's devastation and was simply incapable of imposing the kind of \"Iron Curtain\" on Eastern Europe that Churchill complained of in a famous 1947 speech that is generally seen as an opening salvo in the Cold War. By 1948 Stalin had responded to the threat of western aggression by liquidating fledgling coalition governments in Eastern Europe, often quite brutally, and in this way caused Soviet foreign policy to match Churchill's nasty stereotype, Magri concludes. But blame for more than 30 years of nuclear-inspired tensions between the West and the Soviet bloc did not originate with Stalin. Even for anti-Communist Americans, that's one argument in this book that is worth remembering.\n\nSimilarly, in his account of Italian politics in the 1950s, Magri offers an interesting slant on the role that the U.S. played in repeated efforts to pressure the Italian government to ban the PCI at the time, in defiance of Italy's own postwar constitution. He attributes the PCI's surprising persistence and growth in spite of such pressures largely to the paradoxical effects of a rapid industrialization of the previously backward Italian economy that was essentially carried out by rather ruthless and predatory Italian capitalists, who themselves benefited from the U.S.-backed Marshall Plan.\n\nYet what *The Tailor of Ulm* mostly does not provide, unfortunately, is anything resembling a left-wing organizer's recipe book that DSA activists and other progressives might draw on in hopes of duplicating in the United States some of the successes that the PCI won in Italy. Perhaps there are such overwhelming differences between the backward but rapidly modernizing Italian economy in the 1950s and the rich but sluggish U.S. economy today that make such a left-wing cookbook impossible; Magri's analysis suggests that there probably are. Yet it would have been intriguing if he provided more tactical details on how the PCI won and maintained its once promising position in Italian politics and the global Communist movement, and this book, unfortunately, is mostly lacking in them.\n\nFor example, the PCI under Fascist repression in the 1930s dwindled in size to fewer than 20,000 members, yet between 1943 when an armed Italian resistance began against the remnants of Fascism in the German-occupied north of the country and the reconstruction of Italy in 1946, card-carrying PCI members grew rapidly to 100 times that number. The PCI also won a huge and influential presence in the Italian trade unions by this time, one it had mostly not enjoyed in the 1920s.\n\nWell, apart from the participation of brave and disciplined PCI members in the resistance, how was this seeming miracle accomplished? Magri mostly doesn't say.\n\nAgain, Magri states near the start of his history that the PCI's Palimiro Togliatti led the party to success largely by drawing on Gramsci's political theories. Yet almost nowhere in Tailor of Ulm does Magri state just which of those theories were most important or how exactly the PCI tried to put them into practice.\n\nSimilarly, the PCI by the late 1970s was already becoming famous for electing mayors and city council members to big industrial towns in the north of Italy and running municipal governments that were remarkably honest and effective, especially compared with the ruling Christian Democratic Party's record for scandalous corruption (and sometimes collaboration with the Mafia) elsewhere in the country.\n\nHow did the PCI's electoral politics work? Why were its politicians so much more honest (on average) than the Christian Democratic and sometimes the Socialist opposition? How, too, was the PCI able to command more than a third of the national vote in the mid-1980s, even though the prestige of Communism was declining sharply in other parts of Europe by this time? Again, Magri offers some tantalizing hints, but doesn't really say.\n\nFor these reasons, *The Tailor of Ulm* is probably not a book for younger socialist readers with an activist bent, who are looking for helpful organizing tips from a foreign socialist party that was famous in its day for mass support and successful mobilizations. For readers with an abiding interest in the history of Marxist movements and a sense of how \"Eurocommunism\" gradually emerged from a once seemingly monolithic Third International, however, this is a book that may well be worth its $60 price.\n\nFor DSA readers who are interested in getting an introduction to Gramsci's theories, meanwhile, Verso has another recent anthology, with an introduction by the late Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, sampling Gramsci's early writings as a firebrand leader of factory occupations in Turin, as well as some key passages from his *Prison Notebooks* composed in the 1930s.\n\n[*An Update on Maryland's Legislature*](http://dsadc.org/an-update-on-marylands-legislature/)\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;* March 2014**\n\n*By Woody Woodruff*\n\nJust a little over a month into the Maryland legislature's three-month session, some high-priority bills for progressives are hanging on, an outrageous payback to the wealthy appears to be emerging, and some interesting low-profile progressive bills are gaining strength. Low-wage workers are likely to be the beneficiaries of action on the minimum wage, earned sick leave, ex-offender employability and job retraining and realignment as the state adjusts to a drawdown from the era of military adventurism from which we are slowly emerging. But never underestimate the skills of the state's allegedly deep-blue but quite business-friendly political leadership when the legislature is in session.\n\n**MINIMUM WAGE** The bills in the House and Senate were filed by the respective chamber leaders on behalf of Gov. Martin O'Malley, who wants the popular measure to be a marker of his last year in office. He told a rally: \"If it \\[the $7.25/hr minimum wage\\] had kept pace with worker productivity, it would be $20 an hour right now. If it had kept pace with the earnings of Ronald Reagan's top 1 percent, it would be $273.\"\n\n[*The Sun reported Feb. 17 *](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-sun-poll-wage-marijuana-20140218,0,5747598.story#ixzz2uGlGY0sa)that \"By a wide margin, Maryland voters want to raise the state's minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, a poll conducted for The Baltimore Sun shows. ... Statewide, 69 percent of voters surveyed said they back a proposal now being debated in the General Assembly to increase Maryland's minimum wage from the current federal level of $7.25 an hour to $10.10 by 2016.\" That roughly matches the 71 percent national positive view of a minimum wage increase shown in most recent polls.\n\nThe two \"cross-filed\" bills (SB 331 and HB 295) have each had crowded and grueling hearings in crucial committees. US Rep. Elijah Cummings was a top supporter Feb. 17 at the [*Senate Finance Committee,*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-senate-minimum-wage-20140217,0,7771211.story) where business owners threatened closures of two, three, many Wendy's if it passes. GMU economist Stephen Fuller, a favorite of business, predicted 6000 jobs lost but Economic Policy Institute's David Cooper argued that most data showed little long-term job losses historically despite short-term adjustment bumps.\n\nHB 295's hearing saw over 100 speakers at the Feb. 11 House Economic Matters Committee meeting, noted chair Dereck Davis. Aisha Braveboy, a Prince George's delegate, testified about the poor nutrition available to minimum wage workers and the damage to their children. \"They are not empowered economically.\"\n\nWith the support of Senate leader Mike Miller and House speaker Mike Busch, the main thrust of the wage hike will probably pass, but many ambushes and qualifiers remain.\n\n**ESTATE TAX BREAK**: As if to acknowledge that the impetus behind the minimum wage would require some payback to big business (never far from their hearts), Busch and Miller have sponsored bills \"to increase the Maryland estate tax exemption from the current level of $1 million to the federal level of $5.34 million.\" That would allow more large estates to escape paying a fair share and solve what the business right that lurks inside Maryland's ostensible left to solve what they seem to feel is a millionaire drain. By that notion, the really rich are relocating official residences in other, better states to die.\n\nIn [*a thorough takedown of the maneuver*](http://www.marylandjuice.com/2014/02/guest-post-progressive-maryland-sounds.html) – which has rounded up some ordinarily quite progressive sponsors – Progressive Maryland points out the cost to state revenues of this sneaky move.\n\n[*The Sun reported Feb. 2*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-bz-estate-tax-20140130,0,5064698.story) that \"Warren Deschenaux, the legislature's chief policy analyst, isn't convinced. The man whose job it is to throw cold water on many legislative tax-cutting ideas said bringing the exemption to the federal level would cost $80 million to $90 million a year in revenue when fully implemented\" with little likelihood that revenue would be made up elsewhere. Another Sun interviewee pointed out that real tax relief, costing about the same in revenue, would be expanding the state's earned income tax credit.\n\n**EARNED SAFE AND SICK LEAVE BILL** The proposal to give over 700,000 Marylanders a chance to care for sick children or their own ills without getting fired or (further) impoverished was reintroduced by sponsor Tom Olszewski. At the House hearing Feb. 18 Olszewski outlined changes from last year that he said answered [*some of the businesses' concerns that sank it before*](http://dsadc.org/paid-sick-leave-minimum-wage-advocates-planning-round-2-in-md-legislature/) (he withdrew the 2013 version after an unfavorable committee report, and the Senate bill died in committee without action). They included exempting employers with fewer than 10 employees and the exclusion of some part-time and seasonal employees. The core proposal – that employees can incrementally earn paid leave they can use when they or a family member are sick – remains. The dreaded \"fiscal note\" that accompanies the revised bill still points out \"significant\" small business effects, enforcement costs to the state and increased costs to the hall of shame of local governments that don't offer paid leave now. Work by the Institute for Women's Policy Research is offered in the fiscal note to bolster the contention that additional costs to businesses for providing leave are essentially offset by factors of increased productivity and reduced turnover. The [*Job Opportunities Task Force*](http://www.jotf.org/Advocacy/AnnapolisWatch2014/tabid/253/Default.aspx) of Baltimore website Feb. 24 said both House (HB968) and Senate (SB743) versions were awaiting a committee vote.\n\n**MARYLAND SECOND CHANCE ACT** Companion bills that would allow nonviolent ex-offenders' records to be shielded for purposes of employment were introduced in the Senate [*SB 1056*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?id=sb1056&stab=01&pid=billpage&tab=subject3&ys=2014RS) by Montgomery Sen. Jamie Raskin and the House [*HB 1166*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?id=hb1166&stab=01&pid=billpage&tab=subject3&ys=2014RS) by Baltimore City's Curt Anderson. As the [*Job Opportunities Task Force*](http://www.jotf.org/Advocacy/AnnapolisWatch2014/tabid/253/Default.aspx) points out, \"Jobs are the key to our economic recovery, and the ability to secure a job is crucial to the successful reentry of those returning to society from prison.\"\n\nResearch shows that recidivism risks are highest in the first 3-5 years following incarceration. Given that recidivism declines steadily over time, the proposed legislation would make certain nonviolent misdemeanor convictions eligible for shielding after a waiting period. Law enforcement will continue to have access to the shielded records. The bills are awaiting committee hearings in March.\n\n**COMMISSION ON MARYLAND'S FUTURE**\n\nA healthy and savvy lobbying effort is getting considerable legislative attention to [*a proposed commission*](http://dsadc.org/maryland-looks-at-formal-state-body-on-defense-transition/) that would represent a soft industrial policy for a postwar Maryland. In the words of Miriam Pemberton of IPS, to \"get to work on a plan to align our economic strategy with a smaller defense market.\"\n\nSB 493 would represent also an economic conversion project, aiming at turning the state's heavy dependence on $36 billion annually in military spending toward R&D and worker training in innovative and renewable energy technologies.\n\nPemberton's testimony before the Senate Finance Committee Feb. 18 noted: \"The commission would not enforce change on any specific businesses. Rather it would examine ways the state's existing and emerging competitive advantages can be linked to the needs of communities, workers and businesses facing this historic transition. It will outline a general diversification plan, identifying best practices and most useful ways states can facilitate the transition. It will develop a plan for taking advantage of existing federal programs available for this purpose.\n\nEconomic development specialists agree that advanced planning is critical to the success of an economic transition strategy.\"\n\nBob Stewart, executive director of Local 1994 MCGEO, the public employees' union, stressed that early action on job training was critical to staying ahead of the curve.\n\nPemberton and Fund Our Communities leader Jean Athey were joined in testimony and support by other union representatives, civil rights organizations and Montgomery County's Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe project was developed by a coalition led by Fund Our Communities, a Peace Action affiliate that pushes for conversion of military to social spending. comprising those groups and others and drafted by lead Senate sponsors Richard Madaleno and Roger Manno. The Senate version gained the support of Allan Kittleman, GOP leader. HB 738, the House counterpart, has 30 sponsors including lead sponsor Talmadge Branch of Baltimore City, the majority whip.\n\nTo a state that had been hoping to build a rep as a \"Silicon Valley East\" around the bandits who are clustering on the NSA's part of the map, the idea of a little planning might have appeal. Maryland has been almost terminally embarrassed by a miserable IT-procurement experience with its state Affordable Care Act website.\n\nThe House version faced a hearing Feb. 26 before that graveyard of good ideas, the House Economic Matters Committee. But the low initial cost of such a study panel should get it through those straits.","order":0},{"title":"DC Statehood Advocates to Hold Candidate Forum on March 10","date":"2014-03-05","issue":"March 2014","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Organizations advocating statehood for the District of Columbia will hold a forum for DC candidates for mayor, delegate to the House of Representatives, US (shadow) senator and US (shadow) representative on Monday, March 10.\n\nThe forum, which will take place from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. at Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library, is sponsored by the Stand Up!

But according to a feature story in the Feb. 22 New York Times, this economic revolution seems to be literally killing many of India's poorer farmers. Since 1995, some 290,000 Indian farmers have committed suicide, the Times reports, and while the government doesn't have reliable statistics on what motivated these suicides, anecdotal evidence suggests many farmers have taken out loans at ruinously high interest rates from local money lenders, in hopes of competing more effectively in a more open market.  When their crops fail or the borrowers can't compete as effectively as they had planned, pressures from the money lenders for repayment are causing significant numbers of farmers to kill themselves.\n\n[*http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/world/asia/after-farmers-commit-suicide-debts-fall-on-families-in-india.html?\\_r=0*](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/world/asia/after-farmers-commit-suicide-debts-fall-on-families-in-india.html?_r=0)\n\n\\[from Andy Feeney\\] Coming Soon: Robotic, Self-Driving Slot Cars To Boost Electronics Revolution in the Toy Biz\n\nA group of brilliant Ph.D's in San Francisco have designed the world's first self-driving, quasi-robotic toy race cars, according to USA Today reporter Marco della Cava.

This was not to be. In a system that recognizes no limits, unions and social legislation became necessary in order to provide a floor below which living standards would not fall. It was out of this recognition that the movement for a minimum wage emerged.\n\n****\n\n**ONE**\n\nDuring one of his fireside chats on the radio in 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated the legislative campaign for the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) – the culminating New Deal legislation – with the remark that,\n\n\"A self-supporting and self-respecting democracy can plead no justification for the existence of child labor, no economic reason for chiseling on workers' wages or stretching workers' hours.\"\n\nLater that year, when the Bill was introduced in Congress, he explained the economic logic that made its passage so important for society as a whole, society still mired in the Great Depression,\n\n\"The exploitation of child labor and the undercutting of wages and the stretching of the hours of the poorest paid workers in periods of business recession had a serious effect on buying power ... What does the country ultimately gain if we encourage businessmen to enlarge the capacity of American industry to produce unless we see to it that the income of our working population actually expands sufficiently to create markets to absorb that increased production?\"\n\nThese comments are important to keep in mind today as we campaign for the increased minimum wage for in them are the two threads that have been constants in the efforts to raise the minimum wage – the moral argument that it is undemocratic and unjust to condemn people to poverty and the economic argument that increasing wages for those with the least benefits all, including business, by increasing purchasing power and thereby expanding markets and reviving the economy.\n\nThus the need for a minimum wage – and for a minimum wage that can help lift working people out of poverty – is not an isolated act, nor an act of charity, rather it is rooted in the needs of the vast majority. This broader understanding was inherent in FSLA from its inception, for the Act combined increasing wages with cutting hours (minimum wage, maximum hours), for the first time establishing a 40-hour week. And the legislation, for the first time, made child labor illegal in the United States.\n\n\n\n**TWO**\n\nBut success did not come quickly or easily; in fact the legislation itself was the culmination of many decades of struggle. From the earliest days of the workers movement demands were put forward to end poverty wages, for a limitation on work hours and a ban on child labor. These, however, ran aground, in part due to a Supreme Court ruling in the 1880s with implications with which we must still live – the decision that the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment making African American citizens would be a perfect vehicle to twist around and turn corporations into people. If today that interpretation means that corporations can have free speech, then it meant that they were entitled to \"due process,\" under the 5<sup>th</sup> amendment – therefore, compelling a company to pay workers a minimum wage, compelling business to reduce labor from 12 or 14 hours a day, compelling an employer to only hire adults, was considered a denial of liberty akin to taking someone's property.\n\nThus the movement focused in the early parts of the 20<sup>th</sup> century on a minimum wage for women workers because women as a \"protected,\" class might escape that usage of the constitution. And, more important, it would prove of direct benefit to women employed in sweatshops, textile mills, garment factories, and other industries where their \"protected\" status did not prevent them from being ruthlessly exploited. Campaigning began in earnest around 1910 by middle-class reformers (without much labor support, though it was backed by the Women's Trade Union League) and was joined to a campaign against child labor (another \"protected\" group left unprotected from the ravages of poverty).\n\nBetween 1912 and 1919, 15 states, Washington DC and Puerto Rico enacted minimum wage statutes with the explicit object of enabling women to earn a \"living wage.\" Men were excluded not only because it was thought more possible to uphold constitutional scrutiny as a protective act for women but also because the AFL craft unions were absolutely opposed to a minimum wage for men (fearing it would become a maximum wage and wanting to keep government out of collective bargaining). The resulting minimums were just enough to get by on, and – set as flat rates — unable to keep up with inflation.\n\nEven such progress was halted when Children's Hospital in Washington DC (the predecessor of the one today in Brookland; a plaque stands near Metro Center indicating where it once stood) decided that it was paying its female workforce too much money. In 1923, the Supreme Court in Adkins v. Children's Hospital ruled in the hospital's favor, declaring all minimum wage laws unconstitutional. Then, as now, a conservative court claimed that it was preserving states' rights – even though, it acted to invalidate state law (no different than what happens with campaign finance reform). Then, as now, it took the position that any interference with the \"free market\" would cause economic ruin and that raising the pay for the poorest would only cause higher unemployment. Any government action to defend economic and social justice was judged dictatorial – thus any employer could pay as little as it could get away with, force workers to work as many hours as it demanded, and employ children at any age, no matter how young.\n\nThereafter, one state after the other abolished their labor protections. By the end of the decade the Progressive era law only survived in Massachusetts, and there it was ineffective and unenforced. Harvard University took the first step to undoing the state minimum wage\nby firing all its women employees and replacing them with men whom they\npaid even less. Soon most employers simply stopped complying with the law.\n\nBut the end of 1929 saw the beginning of the Depression, the collapse of business and finance, the rise of unemployment to over a quarter of the workforce. Developments all of which gave the lie to arguments that unrestricted capitalism was economically sound and in the public interest. In the outburst of social activism that followed, a new campaign was underway. The minimum wage fight was led by those most active in \"settlement house work\" – that is amongst the urban poor, especially women. Frances Perkins, whose name today adorns the Department of Labor, was amongst them. She was the first woman ever to serve as a cabinet member, and she became the longest serving of any cabinet member, staying with FDR throughout his Administration. Her decision to accept the post of Secretary of Labor, however, was dependent on FDR's commitment to see minimum wage legislation through to its passage.\n\nAlso involved were progressive, social-minded unionists – the industrial unions grouped in the CIO rejected the AFL's position (most craft unions opposed almost all New Deal social legislation until World War II) and fought for universal provisions/standards for health, pensions, work hours, wages. A leader in the minimum wage movement was Sidney Hillman of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union. For a union such as the ACW, representing workers in a low-wage industry, negotiating with multiple employers, a wage floor was needed not only as a good in and of itself; it was also a means to prevent non-union employers from undercutting unionized employers by paying substandard wages. It was for this reason that a number of small northern manufacturers concerned about runaway shops – in those days going to the segregated, lynch mob dominated South — supported the minimum wage too. Many large corporations, however, fearful of the wave of activism that was expanding union strength opposed New Deal social legislation as \"creeping socialism,\" and argued that the \"market\" alone should dictate wages.\n\nThe pre-civil rights South was where reaction was strongest, its elite leaders identifying Southern economic health with the region's ability to pay low wage. Denying African Americans the franchise made it a one-party region and gave Southern representatives disproportionate power in Congress. Power they used to fight any federal measure that implied equal treatment of black and white, thus at legislation aimed at alleviating poverty. Typical was the comment by South Carolina Senator Ed Smith:\n\n\"Any man on this floor who has sense enough to read the English language knows that the main object of this bill is, by human legislation, to overcome the splendid gift of God to the South.\"\n\nTranslated into English, that meant defending the South's comparative advantage of forcing workers to live on substandard wages – forcing workers, black and white to live on wages below those paid in the North. But the minimum wage had its supporters in that region too, as black and white sharecroppers, tenant farmers, steel workers, and textile workers organized, organizing that encouraged a small number of pro-New Deal political leaders to step forward. Outstanding amongst those in 1937 was a newly elected Florida Congressman who some may recall as being, many years later, a leading defender of Social Security when Ronald Reagan sought to undo it – Claude Pepper.\n\n\n\n**THREE**\n\n\n\nIt was that combination of popular activism, civic engagement and sympathetic government that helped bring a change of heart — or a change of mind when seeing the writing on the wall, know social change was unstoppable — to the then extremely conservative Supreme Court. In 1937, the Court reversed its 1923 decision and in West Coast Hotel v. Parrish upheld the right of the State of Washington to pass minimum wage legislation – arguing that a law which benefits the community as a whole did not violate the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment. This opened up the door for the FLSA – and it opened equally for all subsequent New Deal social legislation creating the safety net we are now fighting to preserve. Because the political climate in the United States has turned since Reagan's election in 1980, with his and his successor's attacks on social welfare, with their attempt to return to the unrestricted capitalism of the 1920s that gave us the Depression, today's Supreme Court has become a \"worthy\" successor to prior Courts that protected the rights of property at the expense of popular rights. Therefore it is worthwhile to recall today the language of the West Coast Hotel v. Parrish decision:\n\n\"Liberty safeguarded in law ... requires ... protection ... against the evils which menace the health, safety, morals and welfare of the people.\"\n\n\"The legislature was entitled to adopt measures to reduce the evils of the 'sweating system,' the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living ... The legislature had the right to consider that its minimum wage requirements would be an important aid in carrying out its policy of protection.\n\n...\n\n\"There is an additional and compelling consideration which recent economic experience has brought into a strong light. The exploitation of a class of workers who are in an unequal position with respect to bargaining power and are thus relatively defenseless against the denial of living wage is not only detrimental to their health and well being but casts a direct burden for their support upon the community. What these workers lose in wages the taxpayers are called upon to pay. The bare cost of living must be met.\"\n\nKey to this language, which also facilitated subsequent civil rights/Great Society legislation, was the assertion that ***\"regulation which is reasonable in relation to its subject and is adopted in the interests of the community***,\" could not be construed as a violation of the 5<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> amendment.\n\nRecent Supreme Courts have ignored that decision, conservative majorities have issued rulings which have step by-step overturned any standard that speaks to the interest of the community, thus undoing the legal edifice for any social welfare measures. The argument that minimum wage hurts small business and leads to higher unemployment – however specious it may be – is language which challenges any consensus as to what is \"in the interests of the community.\"\n\n\n\n**FOUR**\n\n\n\nAttacks limited what Roosevelt and progressives/liberals in Congress could do; the Bill that eventually passed was far from perfect – it allowed employers two (or more) years to reach the new standards of a 40 cent minimum, 40 hour maximum. Child labor was prohibited in \"interstate commerce,\" but numerous exemptions and differentials were allowed*. **The importance of the FSLA, however, lay not in the immediate gains but in the official recognition that working conditions and standard of living were no longer only questions between employer and employee – they were issues for society at large.***\n\nAnd even though weak, it meant immediate pay raises for millions. In 1937, 12 million workers in industries affecting interstate commerce earned less than 40 cents per hour – no southern textile worker earned that much, neither did New England shoe workers. Moreover, it opened up the possibility for changes in the years ahead. After World War II the ban on child labor was vastly extended. Many wage/hour exemptions were eliminated through the years too, especially with the law's expansion in 1961 when coverage was extended to large retail and service enterprises, local transit, construction and gas service stations. In 1966, FLSA's protection was brought to state and local government employees, to hospitals, nursing homes, schools, laundries, large hotels, motels, restaurants, farms. Subsequent amendments added federal, state and local government workers who had remained excluded and certain categories of domestic workers.\n\nMinimum wage pay has generally been inadequate to fully meet the needs of a full-time worker with a family. Pressure, largely from organized labor, has led to the amount being raised more than 20 times – $1 per hour first being attained in 1955. The real minimum wage – adjusted for inflation – reached its highest point in 1968. Those increases also helped maintain a connection between productivity levels and economic growth, between 1947-1973, productivity rose by 104%, the minimum wage rose by 101%. Then came Nixon, Reagan, Bush Sr. and Jr. – the result: between 1973 and 2004, productivity rose by 78%, the minimum wage fell by 24% (non-supervisory workers wages fell by 11% during that period). Which brings us to the present and today's initiatives in Maryland, Washington DC, federally.\n\n\n\n**FIVE**\n\nUltimately the importance of the minimum wage is as one of many means needed to combat rampant poverty in our society. The following quotes\nby Martin Luther King and by Nelson Mandela serve as a reminder that no\nmeasure of social justice should be weakened or left unmoved until all have a decent standard of living, until substantive equality is understood as a needed goal in and of itself.\n\nJust a few days prior to his assassination in 1968, Martin Luther King told workers in Memphis, Tennessee,\n\n\"It is criminal to have people working on a full-time basis ... getting part-time income. We are tired of working our hands off and laboring every day and not even making a wage adequate with daily basic necessities of life.\"\n\n\n\nWhile in London in 2005, Nelson Mandela attended an anti-poverty rally and said to those gathered there,\n\n\"Massive poverty and obscene inequality are such terrible scourges of our times – times in which the world boasts breathtaking advances in science, technology, industry and wealth accumulation – they have to rank alongside slavery and apartheid as social evils.\n\n\"Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.\n\n\"And overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity, It is an act of justice, It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life.\"\n\n****\n\n****\n\n**Sources**:\n\n\n\nIrving Bernstein:\n\n**The Lean Years: A History of the American Worker 1920-1933**, Penguin Books, 1966 (1960)\n\n\n\nKim Bobo:\n\n**Wage Theft in America**, The New Press, 2009\n\n\n\nEileen Boris & Nelson Lichtenstein (editors);\n\n**Major Problems in the History of American Workers**, D.C.

Thirty-three years is a period of time that changes neighborhoods and cities, social changes unnoticeable at the onset can create \"new normals\" that seem to have always been in place. To say that 33 years is a third of a life is optimistic, most of us will not be around to celebrate a 99<sup>th</sup> birthday. Thirty-three years is the length of time that Mumia Abu-Jamal has been behind bars.\n\nOn January 29<sup>th</sup>, the Institute for Policy Studies showed the film *Justice on Trial: The Case of Mumia Abu-Jamal –* a documentary that tells the circumstances that led to a fatal shooting of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981 and of the wounding, arrest, conviction and imprisonment of Mumia Abu-Jamal. And it tells of his struggle for freedom. That struggle has taken place against the backdrop of a determined effort by Faulkner's widow, members of the Philadelphia police department and members of the Pennsylvania political establishment to see Mumia executed – a threat that only ended in 2010 (as the film was being made) when a court ruling definitively took him off death row, but did not reverse his conviction. Instead, he remains in a state prison, serving a life sentence.\n\nNeither Mumia's arrest – and the divide between those who want him free and those who want him dead — can be understood in isolation from our recent past; a past the film attempts to depict. This begins with the radicalization of the Black freedom movement in the late 1960s as the civil rights movement ran into an impassable wall when it attempted to join economic equality with the gains being made toward legal equality. The rampant poverty and police violence that prevailed in the black community made the need for substantive equality especially clear in urban ghettos. Out of those circumstances, the Black Panther Party emerged and found a base of support by attempting to fuse community self-defense with neighborhood programs to provide food, health care and education to those who were being denied. It was a combination that inspired fear and hatred amongst those in power, those who were used to having their commands obeyed – a hatred Mumia experienced first hand in his early teens when participating in a peaceful protest by black students violently attacked by police. Anger at injustice and hope that a better alternative future was possible led him to join the Panthers. But their existence was brief as state-sanctioned repression destroyed the organization from within and without. Such repression was particularly fierce in Philadelphia where the police department epitomized a belief in order over law, power over justice.\n\nRiding the crest of the wave was Frank Rizzo, police chief who was later elected Mayor based on his appeal to racist fear amongst white working people who saw their world in decline and didn't know where else to point their finger. And it was based on the supposed success of his \"toughness\" and brutal methods. Rizzo was amongst those who epitomized the return of the right, a pattern replicated throughout the country and nationally with Ronald Reagan's election as President in 1980. Reagan's victory meant the demise of the hopes that gave birth to civil rights and peace movements, of labor insurgencies and movements of the urban poor, of the hopes of the New Left and of aspirations for a revolutionary change. Many of those willing to give-in decided to advocate a more piecemeal process of reform, while others sought to begin radical change by a turn inward — the path taken in Philadelphia's black community by Operation Move. Mumia was attracted to the movement and, already a journalist, reported on its growth and activities and on the violent attack which left many of its members dead or in prison, with a city block bombed under orders by local government.\n\n\n\n**The Context**\n\nMembership in the Panthers and sympathy with Move were sufficient reason for Philadelphia's police to hate Mumia, that he was a journalist able and willing to expose official corruption was reason all the more. A symbol of what they hated, his presence when Faulkner was shot was sufficient by itself to set in motion a chain of events that could not be stopped. The film documents judicial bias, evidence tampering (and ignoring evidence discovered), jury selection racism as part of a process of a prejudicial process that marked every step of the process through to Mumia's trial. His lawyers have presented evidence of bias and misconduct during his repeated appeals, but none of that has mattered in a criminal justice system designed to keep appeals from going forward rather than resolve them in the interest of justice.\n\nMoreover details mattered little for Mumia was convicted more as a symbol than as an individual. That transference is made obvious by the fury with which Faulkner's widow and the local police, made vivid on screen, reject any evidence that the wrong man may have been convicted. Logic might indicate the opposite, as the aggrieved party should want – more than anything else – to punish the person who \"did it,\" and thus be absolutely positive that the person convicted is in fact the guilty party. But Mumia fit the bill as to all they oppose and thus his finding of guilt is far more important than any concern for the truth. And so he remains in prison.\n\nHe remains there in part because his legal options are narrow, narrow because of changes in defendant rights that have been steadily narrowed from Richard Nixon's days in office. That narrowing occurred as a response by the government to the success of many to use the court system in the 1960s and early 70s to defend civil liberties. And that narrowing took place because the left-wing movement for radical change out of which Mumia's politics first emerged was weakened nationally and globally – the fate of the Black Panther Party an example of repression that took numerous shapes and forms. A sense of what has been lost can be seen when viewing *Free Angela and All Political Prisoners*, a documentary made last year about the arrest and imprisonment of Angela Davis in 1971and about the building of a movement that resulted in her acquittal by an all white jury on charges of murder, kidnapping and conspiracy in 1972 – even after then President Nixon assured the country of her guilt.\n\nFirst publicly attacked by then Governor Ronald Reagan when she was fired from her university teaching position because of her Communist Party membership, Angela's academic skills, radicalism (a term she beautifully defines in the movie), support for the Panthers and for the \"Soledad Brothers\" – three politicized state prison inmates falsely accused of murder – made her a particular target, hated all the more by those who felt threatened by societal changes then underway because she was all this and a black woman. The film depicts the violent repression against those struggling for liberation that Mumia also experienced – but it depicts too a powerful movement for peace, freedom, justice and equality in the US and abroad able to change the terms of debate, able to change the political and legal atmosphere so that her liberation – and that of other falsely accused political prisoners – was possible.\n\nMany of the reforms and social changes gains made in those years have taken hold and have helped change society for the better. But much has been lost too, for in the years since, political space for openly radical politics has been lost, weakening the ground for democratic action in any direction. With socialist ideology and left-wing organization undermined alongside the weakening working-class organization in all of its forms, numerous limitations have been placed on legal rights. The rights of labor, the public rights of communities, the rights of those caught up in the criminal justice system have all been restricted to an extent impossible to imagine in 1971. As a result our public education system is part privatized, divided and ever more unequal, so our unions represent a smaller percentage of the workforce than almost any country in the world, and so we have by far the highest rate of imprisonment, with 2.3 million (60% black or Latino) in prison or jail, millions more on parole or probation. Political prisoners, once able to find arenas for contestation as the brilliant legal defense Angela Davis' team put forward exemplifies, can no longer be implemented as one legal avenue after another blocked. Thus Mumia remains locked up.\n\nYet so too resistance continues. Angela Davis under harsh conditions and imminent threat found a way to create a space for herself, to continue to think, write, struggle and live – space shared with family, friends, solidarity movements, and through the holding on to feelings prison often denies. So too with Mumia who reminds us in *Justice on Trial* that he is not just a political figure, a symbol in the fight for justice, but also a human being who yearns to enjoy the warmth of life. Interviews with his sister help complete the picture, giving a personal dimension without which his politics, and his strength of will are impossible to understand. A will that has enabled him to remain active and engaged during all his years on death row, that enables him to continue to speak out today.\n\nAnd so the campaign for his freedom remains alive and important. At the conclusion of the showing Johanna Fernandez, the film's producer, talked to the audience at IPS through Skype. She explained that although there are no more grounds for appeal, other possibilities for action remain, which is part of the reason this 2010 film is being re-distributed. President Obama recently appointed Debo Adegbile to head the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice – a fortuitous appointment, as Adegbile is familiar with Mumia's case having taken part in the post-sentencing legal briefs that successfully challenged the constitutionality of his death sentence. As the film notes, the officers in the Philadelphia police department have been cited numerous times for corruption, brutality and racism. Therefore the campaign is today focused on Washington DC and building public demand for the Justice Department to launch an investigation of Philadelphia. If the city is found guilty of systemic rights violations, it may be possible to have Mumia's case re-opened, may be possible to win his freedom.\n\n\n\n**The Future**\n\nAnd it may be possible to regain space in which far seeing visions of what society could be again gain political relevance. Mumia and Angela have co-authored an essay that puts forward a vision and a politics of future without the injustices that define our present. To understand what the campaign for his freedom means it is important to grasp the meaning of the 'abolition democracy\" they envision in the following excerpt:\n\nSocial structures—courts, police, prisons, etc.—have within them a deep bias about what constitutes crime and what does not. Any social structure is a product of its previous historical, economic and social iterations, and these previous forms bear significant influence on later forms. The present system, in addition to being increasingly repressive, is the logical inheritance of its racist, hierarchical, exploitative past, and it is also a reactive formation to attempts to transform, democratize, and socialize it.\n\n\n\nFor authentic democracy to emerge, \"abolition democracy\" must be enacted—the abolition of institutions that advance the dominance of any one group over any other. It is the democracy that is possible if we continue the legacy of the great abolition movements in American history, those that opposed slavery, lynching, and segregation. As long as the prison-industrial-complex remains, American democracy will continue to be a false one. Such a false democracy reduces people and their communities to the barest biological subsistence because it pushes them outside the law and the polity.\n\n\n\nThe idea of abolition democracy comes from a reading of U.S. history where the freedom struggle is central to who Americans are and to why we are who we are. We are less exemplars of legendary \"founding fathers\" than we are of \"founding freedom fighters\"—inheritors of those who fought for their freedom, not from a British aristocracy, but from American slavocracy.\n\n\n\nWe need to prepare not only a critique of a repressive, incarceral *status quo,* but a vision of a new, enlightened, more human, more socialized view of a future without mass incarceration.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote:\n\n\"Alternatives to the Present System of Capitalist Injustice,\" by Mumia Abu-Jamal and Angela Y.

During the final year alone I witnessed the across-the-board budget cuts known as \"sequestration\" that led to many employees being furloughed without pay, last October's16-day government shutdown, and the third year of a federal pay freeze. These and other actions (or inactions) by the elected leadership of the government communicate, in no uncertain terms, that civil servants are viewed as something less than valued members of the federal community.\n\nNevertheless, today's feds have it good compared to those yet to be hired. Future workers will have to contribute more than five times as much of their salaries to their retirement compared to current workers – amounting, in effect, to a steep pay cut. Some members of Congress also are threatening to eliminate federal pensions for future employees altogether, which would leave them only with Social Security and their savings to see them through their golden years.\n\nSome elected officials have expressed sympathy with the civil servants' plight. Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, for instance, noted that federal employees \"have been the targets of unending attacks. They've been furloughed, laid off and locked out through no fault of their own.\"\n\nTo be sure, it's congressional Republicans who have been the principal instigators of the attacks on federal workers, while President Obama and many Democrats in Congress have spoken up in favor of their employees. Yet for the past several years, the defenders of federal employees have retreated while fed-bashers have been on the march.\n\nElected officials who demean their employees, freeze their pay, threaten their retirement earnings and label them as \"non-essential\" have to ask themselves: How will this affect the federal workforce over the long term?\n\nI could have asked myself a similar question when I first went to the work for the government in 1982. While many of my peers were gravitating to high-paying jobs in the corporate sector, I viewed working for the federal government as an honorable way to serve the public while earning a decent salary and benefits, if not in the same league as my classmates who became corporate lawyers. Yet President Reagan had just fired the air traffic controllers for striking, federal employees were subject to \"reductions in force\" (a polite term for \"firings\"), and in general the treatment of civil servants was at a low point. But they fared somewhat better during the George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations, and federal service became a more attractive career option for many. After the 9/11 attacks and the nationwide mobilization of the war against terror, elected officials seemed to gain a new appreciation for the value of a dedicated, highly motivated federal workforce. However, the anti-government Tea Party's success in the 2010 congressional election put fed-bashing back on the agenda.\n\nAccording to the Government Accountability Office, about 30 percent of federal workers will be eligible to retire by 2016. Even before the most recent attacks on federal workers, experts were predicting a federal \"retirement tsunami\" in the near future. What incentive, besides economic necessity, would keep them working in this atmosphere? If the attacks on feds convince more veteran employees to retire than usual, agencies could suffer serious gaps in experience and institutional memory.\n\nAlthough the economy is said to be recovering, there are still more job seekers than available jobs, and few federal vacancies will be lacking applicants for the foreseeable future. But what will happen when the economy is booming, as it was in the late 1990s? Will the government be able to compete for the best-qualified, most highly motivated applicants? Or will it become an employer of last resort, having to accept second-tier hires while the blue-chip candidates opt for higher-paying private-sector jobs? Stories in the media have chronicled how attacks on the civil service have made recent college graduates reluctant to seek government careers, or driven current federal workers to private-sector jobs. In many professional fields — such as law, the sciences and information technology — federal pay can't compete with the private sector but has traditionally compensated with good benefits and the satisfaction of serving the public. If you take these away, why would anyone choose a government career?\n\nDo members of Congress want less-qualified, less-motivated workers inspecting their constituents' food, controlling their flights and ensuring the safety of their drinking water? For some – if they were truthful – the answer would be \"yes.\" The attacks on federal workers are part of the larger conservative effort to undercut and devalue the role of government in society, of which the sequester and the shutdown were only the latest chapters.\n\nA shrunken, demoralized, less-qualified, less-motivated federal workforce will lead to a government even less able to serve the public and act as a check on runaway corporate abuses. The botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act was both a result of and further contribution to this degradation of government. The inability of the government to set up the ACA on its own led to the hiring of an unqualified contractor; and the contractor's failure has invited more attacks on the government's competence to administer complex domestic programs. The right does its best to ignore federal programs that have worked well, such as Social Security and Medicare, when backed by adequate resources and broad public support.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way. Government again can become the first choice for the best and brightest – but only if outrage over the attacks on government itself forces conservatives to back off. Only then will federal employees find themselves treated with respect rather than contempt.","order":8},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—March 2014 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"March 2014","order":-1,"date":"2014-03-05","body":"Welcome to the*Washington Socialist*'s March 2014 issue.\n\nNote that our regular membership meeting is Saturday, March 8 at 2:30 p.m. at the Cleveland Park Library branch, 3310 Connecticut Ave. NW, Washington DC 20008.

Unsurprisingly, this is causing an increasing number of current federal workers to seek to leave the government, either through retirement or moving to the private sector, while fewer new graduates see civil service as an attractive career option. And this is part of the conservative plan: A shrunken, demoralized, less-qualified, less-motivated federal workforce will lead to a government even less able to serve the public and act as a check on runaway corporate abuses.\n\nAs the **NSA scandal** deepens, countries around the world (friendly and not so) show increasing concern about the security of their Internet communications.

Last November, then-At-Large Councilmember Phil Mendelson was elected council chair, replacing Brown. Continuing the game of musical chairs, Mendelson's old seat is now open, necessitating the upcoming balloting.\n\nBut before delving into the specifics of the at-large election, I'd like to call attention to another issue on the ballot: an amendment to the DC charter, placed on the ballot by the District Council, to free the DC budget from the congressional appropriations process. The entanglement of the District budget in federal appropriations, a byproduct of congressional control over DC legislation, has been a major obstacle to effective governance since the District gained limited home rule in 1974. Besides delaying the District's ability to put its budget into effect, Congress has exploited the process to add legislative \"riders\" on the DC budget that impose right-wing social policy over the objections of the local citizenry. In the recent past, these riders have banned the District from adopting domestic partnership laws, allowing the use of marijuana for medical purposes, and carrying out a needle-exchange program to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS. While all these restrictions were eventually lifted, the threat of Congressional meddling is ever-present: Two years ago Congress barred the District from paying for abortions for poor women, a restriction that still stands.\n\nThe legality of the District's unilaterally abolishing congressional budget oversight has been questioned by D.C. Attorney General Irvin Nathan and other legal experts. In addition, many statehood advocates have criticized the move as a distraction when the focus should be on full statehood, which would bring with it full budget and legislative autonomy. Nevertheless, the DC government should be looking at ways to force the issue of independence from Congress, and the Council deserves credit for its creativity and for seizing the initiative. Even if the measure is eventually overturned, it could force members of Congress to go on record against democracy and in favor of micromanaging the District's affairs. Statehood and full-democracy advocates should applaud this newfound willingness on the part of DC legislators to confront Congress directly.\n\n.  Now, for the Council race:\n\nElections in DC to fill vacant seats are one-round-only affairs, with no primary. Any registered voter, regardless of party affiliation, can get on the ballot by submitting the required 3,000 petition signatures. These elections can have crowded fields, and the April 23 ballot will feature seven candidates. Only a plurality of votes is needed to win.\n\nEven though this election is to fill a vacant seat, there is an \"incumbent\" in the race. Due to an oddity of DC election law, whenever an at-large council seat becomes vacant, the political party of the former member selects an interim councilmember to occupy the office until a special election is held. In this case, the DC Democratic Committee selected its chairperson, Anita Bonds, as interim councilmember. (There is growing sentiment for eliminating the ability of parties to select interim councilmembers and to simply leave the office vacant until an election can be held). It should be noted that being an interim councilmember is not necessarily an electoral advantage – most recently, Sekou Biddle, appointed by the party as interim member when Kwame Brown moved up to council chair, lost his seat to Vincent Orange in the 2011 special election.\n\nMetro DC Democratic Socialists of America has not endorsed a candidate in the race. However, there are significant differences between the candidates. The brief summaries below are my own personal observations, and offered as an informal guide for DSA members and other readers of the *Washington Socialist*. Comments and contrary views from readers are welcome and encouraged. Those wanting detailed descriptions of the candidates' views should visit their websites.\n\n**Anita Bonds** – As the anointed favorite of the DC Democratic State Committee, Bonds is the nominal front-runner and the \"establishment\" candidate. She has a long history of involvement in DC civic affairs, much of it Democratic Party-related, and as a senior government official in several mayoral administrations. DC statehood advocates, however, can't forget that it was on her watch that the national Democratic Party dropped support for statehood from its 2012 platform, with seemingly little protest from her or other local Democratic leaders.\n\n**Michael A. Brown** – Brown is attempting to return to the Council after his loss last year, following a campaign plagued by missing campaign funds and charges of ethical lapses. During his single term on the Council, Brown was perhaps the elected official most active in promoting the cause of DC statehood. He served as an Independent in the at-large seat reserved for non-Democrats, but for this race he has reclaimed his previous identity as a Democrat.\n\n**Matthew Frumin** – Frumin, a Democrat, is a Ward 3 advisory neighborhood commissioner. Despite being a candidate without much of a citywide profile or record, he is running hard and was an early leader in the fundraising race. His campaign literature, other than mentioning the need for voting representation and DC statehood, runs the gamut of noncontroversial apple-pie issues: education, jobs, infrastructure, and helping seniors.\n\n**Patrick Mara** – The sole Republican in the race, Mara previously challenged Councilmember Carol Schwartz for the 2008 GOP nomination for an at-large seat. He won the primary, but lost the general election to Michael A. Brown. In 2010, he was elected to the DC State Board of Education. He had hardly settled into that office when he was running for Council again, this time falling short in the April 2011 special election won by Vincent Orange. Despite his eagerness to leave the Board of Education behind, he bills himself as an \"education reformer,\" and in true Republican fashion advocates a freeze on taxes and lower regulatory burdens on business.\n\n**Perry Redd** – Redd, a first-time candidate and member of the Statehood Green Party, has a platform stressing DC statehood, tax and budget fairness, and policies to create jobs for DC residents. Redd's website speaks frankly about his past incarceration due to substance abuse and later, as an activist in Tennessee for workers' rights and against police brutality, being indicted on gun and drug-trafficking charges (of which he was eventually cleared) which he believed were in retaliation for his activism.\n\n**Elissa Silverman** – Silverman is a Democrat and journalist, formerly covering DC issues for the *Washington Post* and *Washington City Paper*. More recently, she was a leader of the unsuccessful campaign for a ballot initiative to eliminate corporate campaign contributions in local election. She promises to focus on \"integrity, accountability and investment.\"\n\n**Paul Zukerberg** – Political newcomer and Democrat Zukerberg's platform stresses one central issue: decriminalization of marijuana possession – a worthy issue, given how excessive penalties for this offense has saddled hundreds of young people in the District with criminal records for life, but is it enough to build a Council campaign around? His literature does also indicate that he is against crime, for improving schools and for \"making DC a better place.\"\n\nA special election with a large field of candidates such as this one breaks the mold of the typical DC race, where the meaningful vote is the Democratic primary. A lesser-known candidate can sneak through to victory with less than a majority of the vote by standing out from the crowd or capturing the support of a small, well-targeted constituency. That was the path taken by a relatively unknown, openly gay Republican named David Catania when he upset interim councilmember and Democratic Party favorite Arrington Dixon in 1997. Sixteen years later, Catania (no longer a Republican) is still on the Council. There are undoubtedly a few candidates in this election dreaming of following Catania's path into the Wilson Building.","order":0},{"title":"How Inequality Hurts Everyone: Review of \"The Price of Inequality\" by Joseph E. Stiglitz","date":"2013-03-31","issue":"April 2013","author":"Daniel Adkins","body":"This splendid economics book is great because it tells you who is screwing you and how they are doing it. A major theme of the book is that our current increasing inequality is the result of political forces more than economic forces. All economies' systems exist in the context of their government's rules or lack of rules.\n\n\n\n**Alleged Markets as Scams**\n\nDr. Stiglitz demonstrates that much of the wealth in the US stems from wealth transfers instead of wealth creation. One example in the book is the role played by \"economic rent,\" defined as a payment to a factor of production in excess of that which is needed to keep it employed in its current use. Such rents can arise when monopolies charge inflated prices for goods after they have eliminated their competition or when banks too big to fail can take risks they could not sustain without a government to bail them out. Also an example of rent is that Obamacare does not allow the government to negotiate drug prices, thus giving drug companies excess profits by not having to compete. A law passed by Congress not allowing student loans to be canceled by bankruptcy removed banks from any risk that the student or educational institution might not be viable and placed all the risk on the student. This subverts the student and the market. Another example is the United States using defense spending to \"stabilize\" risky markets (i.e. keeping the price of oil down and stable), thus giving oil companies and fossil fuels a pass on market risks. The book maintains that rent-seeking impairs overall economic efficiency by using market manipulations to subsidize corporations by public funds. Economic rents are merely redistribution of wealth from the many to the few.\n\nThis book's hypothesis is that markets are real but shaped (corrupted) by the political process. In a real market (one with competition) the laws of competition say the profits should decline due to competition, but with the improper government support they can be maintained. Current market imbalances partially resulted from technological changes that make it difficult for labor to migrate to new markets, but more important is that government has been managed to extend monopoly rents to favor some and disadvantage the many.\n\n\n\n**Democracy in Peril**\n\nInequality, then, has not risen from abstract market forces but has been shaped by political efforts. For the 1%, spending in elections is not a civic duty but an investment for which they expect a return. This tilting of the economy and the Great Recession has eroded the public trust and social cohesion. Inequality erodes social capital (trust), sowing the seeds of conflict. Trust is needed for people to believe in the political system. Americans have been proud that their economy was fair but this belief has been greatly challenged and no longer works. The wealthy try to disenfranchise the poor and disempower the rest by unlimited corporate donations and setting the social-political dialogue with economic theories (i.e. markets are self-correcting) that are proven false but repeated so often that many think them true. Also, the Constitution does not give corporations any inalienable rights but the Supreme Court is trying to. A great effort has been made to make unethical and undemocratic practices legal.\n\nThe 1% has rigged politics and political discussion to promote their interests. Their influences have subverted the US political system, and neither political party has shown any interest in reforming the system. Candidates are so dependent on campaign funds that they are easily manipulated. The revolving doors between politicians and lobbyists subvert our politics. Wall Street has cognitively captured the regulatory agencies by the revolving door between them and by setting the ideological discussion. Elections and politics have become a game of redistricting and manipulation by advertising. The war on government is an ideology to make sure the public does not interfere with the 1%'s acquisition of wealth even when that acquisition covers almost all of the nation's profits and more.\n\nExtreme concentration of income is not compatible with democracy and creates an entitled class born to wealth but expanding their wealth by market manipulation not invention. This group aims to privatize as much of the government as possible.\n\n\n\n**Paths Forward**\n\nStiglitz sees two routes toward reform. One is if the 99% come to realize that what is good for the 1% is not in their interest. If the 99% realize this, we have a political system that can be redefined to promote less-corrupted markets and politics, political space for unions and public interests, fact-based media, new types of economic organization like codetermination, and a viable democracy. Such a movement has not crystallized yet, but the Great Recession and economic stress are removing illusions at a fast rate.\n\nThe other possibility would be if the 1% see the error of their ways. Waiting around for this option does not seem useful, but the current strategy of the 1% is pushing the US into a being a less-developed country at a disadvantage in competing with developed and emerging countries.\n\nThe reasons why the 1% might change their minds are also reasons that the 99% must push for change. The US does not have a national competitor to make the 1% want an efficient and powerful economy, but the US decline is increasing. Already many of the US's advantages have dropped to the bottom rank among developed countries. Although the possibilities of a major war are not great, it should be remembered that we won WWII by overwhelmingly out-producing the Axis, and now that manufacturing base is disappearing. US upward mobility is now less than many developed countries because of US educational costs, our health services costing twice as much for ~~worst~~ worse results, and the focus on short–term profits blinding us to the needs of long-term challenges such as worldwide climate change. All of these changes are minimizing US influence which will decline naturally as the world develops. The question remains, do we want to continue to accelerate that decline and our demise?\n\nOne outstanding part of the book is the wealth of documentation and references. This may allow us to demystify the arguments of those who try to maintain the political and economic scam of the American people.\n\nThis book is a good statement of the current economic problems. But better treatments are found in Robert Reich's *Supercapitalism;* Paul Krugman's *The Conscience of a Liberal;* and Jeffery Sachs' *The Price of Civilization.* What those three sources offer which I find lacking in Stiglitz is a good comparison of American economic performance since from 1950 to at least 1973 and from 1980 to 2007. The earlier period shows the performance of the economy which was governed by a \"democratic\" set of laws and regulations. The period since 1980 shows the performance of the economy under an increasingly plutocratic set of laws and regulations.","order":1},{"title":"Impressions and Responses: Socialist Salon on Schweickart's \"After Capitalism\"","date":"2013-03-31","issue":"April 2013","author":"Jose Gutierrez","body":"***Nearly 20 members of the local and interested parties met March 21 in our monthly \"Socialist Salon\" to discuss Schweickart's book. Co-chair Jose Gutierrez and Steering Committee member Andy Feeney led the discussion, and their contributions — Gutierrez' thematic summary and Feeney's view as a self-described \"fan\" – are foregrounded here. Ross Templeton's robust critique of the book anchored and represented a lively discussion and debate. A 2004 *review by Carl Davidson* called it \"an excellent starting point and organizing principle\" for radicals, and also provides a detailed breakdown.***\n\n**Review of the economic model described in *After Capitalism*, by David Schweickart**\n\n*By Jose Gutierrez*\n\nWhat follows is what I hope is a simple description of David Schweickart's proposal for a postcapitalist economy.\n\n**Public Provision of Goods **\n\nAccording to Schweickart, his proposal, which he calls \"Economic Democracy,\" would build on the foundation of Nordic social democracy so that certain vital services such as health care, education, child care and elder care would be economic rights to which all citizens would be entitled.\n\n**Competitive market for goods and services **\n\nSchweickart believes that markets are superior to central planning but that they should be confined to goods and services and not embrace labor or capital.\n\n**Workplace democracy **\n\nThe labor market would be replaced with worker self-management. Enterprises would be organized as democratic communities.\n\n**Social control of investment **\n\nThe surplus value created by workers would be channeled to a national investment fund. All enterprises would be charged a capital asset tax for this purpose. Public banks would draw from this investment fund and worker-managed enterprises would be created using these funds or would add employees toexisting enterprises.\n\n**Full employment**\n\nUnder capitalism unemployment serves the function of keeping working people as a class in check. This would not be the case under Economic Democracy. Public banks would have a mandate to expand employment. Schweickart believes that in spite of this the government should have a role as employer of last resort to guarantee full employment.\n\n**Capitalism within socialism. **\n\nThere would continue to exist a sector composed of small private businesses. Schweickart believes that for the sake of innovation and economic dynamism it would be healthy for such a sector to exist, and the fact that this sector would have to compete with democratically run companies and with the government as employer of last resort would keep the antisocial tendencies of these companies in check.\n\n**Socialist protectionism **\n\nA tariff would be created that would tax goods created with low wages or that were the result of environmentally unsound practices.\n\n**Leisure **Schweickart draws on the work of Juliet Schor, professor of sociology at Boston College, who has studied trends in working time, leisure and women's issues. Schor wrote, among several other books, *The Overworked American*. He mentions her work on leisure and how many Americans are either overworked or don't have work. Shortening the workweek and sharing work are part of his vision of socialism. He argues that under \"Economic Democracy\" both government- and worker-managed firms should reduce the workweek for the sake of a more balanced life outside of work and for environmental reasons.\n\n**Democracy **Worker-managed enterprises would be by definition an expansion of democracy. Through social control of investment, the polity at the national, state and local level would have a say over investment decisions, which would also be a democratic victory.\n\nMost importantly, there would not be a large capitalist class that through campaign contributions, lobbyists and think tanks comes to dominate the political system. That class also could not engage in an investment strike that could bring down the government.\n\nSchweickart also argues that his proposal would not be a panacea that would solvegender equality issues and environmental degradation, but he thinks it would lay a strong foundation to address both issues.\n\n\n\n**A Model for \"Market Socialism\" With Workers' Control**\n\n*By Andy Feeney*\n\nAs the host of this event and a fan of Schweickart's book, I thought this was an excellent Salon. There was more debate and disagreement with Schweickart's vision than I expected or hoped for, but I believe it's essential for DSA members to undertake exactly this kind of debate in order to develop a persuasive vision that can make real democratic socialism possible in the United States – if not in my lifetime, then in that of younger DSA members.\n\n\"Utopian\" visions of the socialist future and detailed plans for what a socialist society should look like have had a bad reputation in Marxist socialist circles since the 1840s, when Marx and Engels in *The Communist Manifesto* repudiated visionary socialism as a waste of time.. They instead looked to class struggle, rooted in the obvious conflicts between 19<sup>th</sup> century capitalists and the European proletariat, as the only \"scientific\" path to a revolutionary future.\n\nThe problem is, it was fairly easy for revolutionary (and not so revolutionary) socialists to agree on the struggle against capitalism and imperialism so long as no one was quite sure what \"socialism\" or \"communism\" would mean in practice. And for better or worse, this situation dramatically changed with the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.\n\nSince the Bolshevik Revolution, millions of people around the world have identified \"socialism\" with what Lenin, Trotsky, and later Stalin and Stalin's heirs wrought in Russia and Eastern Europe – a model of \"socialism\" that essentially collapsed in approximately 1990.\n\nMillions of others have identified \"socialism\" with non-revolutionary European social democracy, as implemented by socialist parties (in name, anyway) in France, Germany, Scandinavia and to some extent the United Kingdom. But this \"socialism\" is essentially capitalism with a strong welfare state and a powerful union movement, and since the 1980s many \"socialist\" European parties have in fact implemented capitalist-style austerity programs to the dismay of their own supporters.\n\nCountless other advocates of \"socialism\" since the 1960s have looked to African socialism, pan-Arab socialism etc. as models of how a non-capitalist future should be built, yet these non-western \"socialist\" models in many cases have failed as well.\n\nOne result is that by the early 1980s, a triumphant Margaret Thatcher in Britain could spearhead the reversal of British \"socialism,\" such as it was, and the dismantling of Labour Party reforms on the basis that free-market capitalism is inevitable, since (supposedly) \"there is no alternative\" – a position conservatives have sometimes abbreviated as TINA.\n\nEchoing Thatcher and the TINA school of conservative capitalism, US philosopher Francis Fukayama wrote in the late 1980s that \"capitalist market democracy\" was the *End of History* – that in the crucible of world economic competition, capitalism had proven itself superior for all time to \"socialism\" in any guise*,* and that the global future thus must be capitalist.\n\nAs an older American radical from the 1970s, David Schweickart has been arguing for decades that TINA is simply wrong – that there is IS an alternative to capitalism. And in *After Capitalism*, Schweickart shows the outlines of an alternative system that he argues could be just as economically efficient as capitalism, but without capitalism's obvious flaws.\n\nSuch flaws include chronically high unemployment, endemic job insecurities for millions of workers, uncontrolled flight of capital investment and capitalist factories from high-wage societies like the United States to low-wage societies like China, and not the least, the ecologically ruinous addiction to perpetual economic growth that characterizes capitalist economies more than any previous economies in history.\n\nSchweickart characterizes capitalist economies as rested on three or four key principles, including a market exchange of goods and services, a private market for capital investment, and \"wage labor\" – a hierarchical organization of work in which relatively powerless workers (in Marx's terms, \"proletarians\"), in exchange for monetary pay, must essentially accept the dictatorial power of capitalist bosses and capitalist owners in the workplace.\n\nThe failed \"socialism\" of the old Soviet Union, Schweickart argues, abandoned the market exchange of goods and services, adopting central economic planning instead. It also replaced private capital markets with government investment. But it retained wage labor and the hierarchical subordination of working people to managers – in this case, managers working for the State. In the process, it subjected working people to a form of \"alienation\" that Marx saw as a key feature of capitalism and its major flaw.\n\nSchweickart in *After Capitalism* proposes instead to abandon Soviet-style central economic planning and retain a market exchange of goods and services. But his model – based in part on what Tito attempted to achieve in Yugoslavia in the 1960s and 1970s – would replace wage labor with worker control over the means of production.\n\nScwheickart also would jettison both central government control of investment and a private capital market and replace them with public control over investment through regional or state-controlled public banks.\n\nOne striking feature of Schweickart's vision of \"Economic Democracy,\" to my mind, is that he explicitly proposes to eliminate capitalist investors as a social class – at least on a lasting basis. Most functions now served by private investors would be taken over by worker-managed enterprises, elected factory managers and public banks in Economic Democracy as Schweickart outlines it.\n\nPrivate entrepreneurs, even large ones, would be allowed to practice capitalism on a limited basis, but none could pass on their holdings to their heirs. Instead, all privately owned firms would be socialized upon the owner's death, thus – in Schweickart's mind – preventing the permanent existence of private capitalists as a class.\n\nIn my view, Schweickart's \"market-socialism\" with workers' control offers an economically plausible model of a non-capitalist future that might eventually allow socialist movements to regain the sense of hope and possibility that much of the left lost with the crimes and mistakes of Stalinism, the compromises of Euro social democracy, the failure of Gorbachev's *perestroika* and the disappointing performance of most forms of Third World socialism.\n\nHowever, some participants at our Socialist Salon clearly disagree with the model, and I think some of their criticisms are instructive.\n\nI hope our debate on Thursday \\[March 21\\] will help to engage all of us more in thinking seriously about a non-capitalist future, whether it takes the form of \"market socialism\" and \"worker control\" as Schweickart envisions them or not.\n\nWhat's essential is not that democratic socialists sign up for any particular model of the future – Schweickart's or anybody else's. What's essential is that we come up with a cogent reply to the TINA argument posed by the conservatives – and also, unfortunately, by all too many liberals, both inside and outside of the Democratic Party. We need to prove to our own satisfaction – and that of a vast majority of Americans – that another world IS possible, if people have the vision and the courage to fight for it.\n\n**If this is Socialism then Spam is Meat**\n\n*By Ross Templeton*\n\nThis was a good meeting – I enjoyed it! Lots of well-developed opinions expressed in a genial atmosphere that seemed welcoming to newer members. If anyone who is reading this hasn't made it to one of DSA's salons yet, I encourage them to do so. It will be worth their while.\n\nGetting a chance to discuss ideas, socialist or otherwise, in a group setting is important. The group mind can be remarkably efficient at separating the wheat from the chaff. A key concept that one missed will be explained by someone else; a bias shared by one reader and the author will be uncovered by someone with a different background. Good ideas get improved upon; bad ideas show their internal contradictions.\n\nDavid Schweickart's *After Capitalism* falls into the latter category. The book, and the model it espouses, suffers from two unfortunate tendencies: colonization by dominant-culture ideology, and narrowness of focus.\n\nSchweickart seems enamored, as another salon-goer remarked to me, with the protestant work ethic. He bends over backward to include capitalists, which he calls \"entrepreneurs,\" in his system. He envisions a system in which peoples' labor is still alienated from them by private capital. Why? All Schweickart can offer for justification are assertions of the superior initiative, ingenuity and drive of entrepreneurial capitalists. This is laughable. I don't recall needing entrepreneurs to set up the distribution of goods and services during Occupy. Schweickart's worldview is so colonized by capitalist mythology that he sees entrepreneurs as innovators, rather than as capitalists who exploit the need for innovation.\n\nSchweickart has been in academia for decades. His book shows the biases of ivory-tower theorizing. He relies on economic models to demonstrate his system's functionality but misses some practical and moral flaws that can't be expressed in numbers.\n\nGender liberation is a good example. Schweickart is personally concerned with this issue, if we are to judge by comments in the book's preface. His model, however, ignores the economic disparity between men, women and trans people. In fact, it would likely continue to make it worse. Schweickart calls for the structurally unemployed to form a government-controlled, minimum-wage underclass. His examples for the tasks given to these workers, such as child and elder care, are industries overwhelmingly staffed by women. Women would find themselves disproportionately relegated to this new proletariat*\\[Cc1\\]*. In addition, the disproportionate share of unpaid domestic labor performed\nby women would go on unabated.\n\nSchweickart would claim that his model is gender-blind because it is an economic model, nothing more. This narrowness of focus is appropriate in a research paper, but unacceptable in a recipe for social and/or economic change. Gender and other culturally-constructed categories have a real economic impact on peoples' lives. Any economic system that ignores them unconsciously privileges the dominant class.\n\nDavid Schweickart's idea of socialism is too adulterated to deserve the term. It is weighed down by the assumptions of the capitalist era and the baggage of patriarchy. Nevertheless, I'm glad we had a chance to discuss it. Any excuse to enjoy some fine Chinese food with friends is a good excuse to me.\n\nSee you at the next salon!","order":2},{"title":"Paid Sick Leave Meets a Legislative Roadblock","date":"2013-03-31","issue":"April 2013","author":"","body":"UPDATED see below:\n\nLike many legislatures, Maryland's Assembly is structured to make sure that dominant business interests have qualified veto power over populist enthusiasms.\n\nThe House of Delegates Economic Matters Committee and the Senate's Finance Committee are well-fashioned roadblocks and graveyards for progressive legislation.\n\nEven successful legislation like this year's offshore wind enabling act took three sessions to fight its way through first the House ambush in Economic Matters and then, last year, Senate Finance. In most cases, it is the dreaded required Fiscal Note – an economic impact statement – that often brings an unfavorable committee report.\n\nThis year, one of many casualties of this business-friendly impact statement was a modest attempt to bring paid sick leave to over 700,000 Maryland workers, mostly hourly wage-earners, who currently must choose between going to work sick or losing a day's pay. In many cases, the choice includes caring for a sick family member, particularly a child – or letting a sick child go to school or day care.\n\nEconomic Matters returned an unfavorable report on Del. Tom Olszewski's Earned Safe and Sick Leave bill (HB0735), which would have provided up to seven earned sick leave days per year for workers in private and public sectors not already covered by labor agreements.\n\nThe fiscal note that accompanied the bill may have doomed it before it received a hearing before the House committee Feb. 27. Olszewski, a Baltimore County Democrat, led off a panel of advocates who presented evidence that the improvement in working conditions that paid sick leave would bring – and has brought in other states – improved workplace efficiency and productivity and, emphatically, public health.\n\nThe fiscal note, however, focused narrowly on the unnumbered but \"significant\" costs to business and government that could result. No public benefits are on the radar in most fiscal notes. This structured business-biased ambush, plus hostile (and inaccurate) observations from Republican members, brought the bill's unfavorable report in mid-March and its withdrawal by prime sponsor Olszewski. Though Democrats had a substantial majority on Economic Matters, few sprang to the bill's defense. The standard mantra that even a good bill must fail in two sessions before passing on a third attempt appeared to be in force.\n\n*UPDATE April 3 2013: Melissa Broome of the Job Opportunities Task Force added that the Business Regulations subcommittee of Economic Matters was the original source of the unfavorable report. A senior policy advocate for the Baltimore-based nonprofit, Broome said the withdrawal in part was because \"it became clear we didn't have the votes for this year.\"*\n\nThe Senate counterpart to HB0735, SB0698, is \"still alive\" in that body, said one of the co-sponsors, Sen. Victor Ramirez of Prince George's County, in late March. His email sounded resigned, however, to refiling it in the 2014 session. That bill, which as of March 31 had not been withdrawn, had a similarly rough time in a hearing on the same day in Senate Finance, causing harried sick leave proponents to shuttle back and forth across the crowded streets of Annapolis's little government sector. The documents indicate, though, that the Senate bill is different enough from HB0735 that it did not represent a true \"cross-file.\" If by some odd chance the full Senate should pass it, the House would be able to consider it on the floor, bypassing the Economic Matters roadblock.

Trans-national community resistance put a freeze on the WTO. It stopped the Free Trade Area of the Americas \\[and\\] it can stop the TPP.\"\n\nSuggested actions on or around May 11 include holding \"community assemblies to discuss the problems with TPP\" (and with free trade in general), and staging \"creative actions or stunts that draw attention to the TPP talks in Peru.\"\n\nActivists should visit the website TPPxBorder.org/ for information about May 11th events already planned and to share information about those they are developing themselves.\n\nLabor journalist Roger Bybee, in a critical article on Obama's trade policies in *Dollars & Sense* last fall, portrayed the TPP and other trade policies supported by the Obama White House as potentially subordinating elected governments everywhere to an \"emerging doctrine of global corporate supremacy, privileging maximum investor profits over protections for workers, consumers, and the environment.\"\n\nIn a February 2013 statement recently by the AFL-CIO's Executive Council, the AFL-CIO stopped short of saying that the TPP must be stopped. But the Executive Council Statement pointed out:\n\n\" Promoting economic growth with equity in the United States and worldwide requires an approach that couples expansion and enforcement of labor rights globally with necessary reforms in trade and economic policy. These reforms must break from current policies to address income inequality through demand-led growth, as part of a Global New Deal that raises incomes and standards of living for all.\n\nThe U.S. trade model, which began with NAFTA and continued with the Korea and Colombia agreements, undermines those goals by encouraging employers to pit one group of workers against another—both within and between countries.\"\n\nThe Executive Committee continued: \"The AFL-CIO believes there is a serious risk that the TPP ..will repeatthe mistakes of the NAFTA trade model.\" The AFL-CIO has proposed a number of progressive changes to the proposed treaty to address labor policies and the regulation of investment, as well as \"environment, food safety and other public interest regulation.\" But \"...unless the TPP marks a break with the current trade model,\" the Executive Committee warned, \"workers will be unable to support it.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups warn that the TPP appeared geared to open up natural resources to exploitation, as well as workers. According to Greenpeace International, the TPP as proposed would promote continued corporate destruction of tropical rainforests.\n\nIn a March 15 statement, the Sierra Club recently reacted with special alarm to news that the new government of Japan has announced its intention to join the TPP.\n\nJapan is hoping for a major increase in its imports of natural gas from North America, the Sierra Club noted, and it appears that the TPP \"would allow for automatic exports of natural gas to countries in the bloc, overriding the Department of Energy's ability to thoroughly review environmental and economic impacts of the exports.\"\n\nConsequently, the Sierra Club fears that adoption of the TPP with Japan as a member could significantly increase the dangers posed by natural gas \"fracking\" and decrease the U.S. government's ability to regulate fracking's adverse side effects.\n\nEven Prestowitz, despite his championing of previous free trade deals by the Reagan and Clinton administrations, concludes that TPP is \"lose-lose for the US, both geopolitically and economically.\"\n\nGiven such negative reactions to the TPP by American constitutencies – notably organized labor and environmentalists – that are important to the Democratic Party, why is the White House now taking such a positive approach to the TPP and other free trade pacts, such as those the US signed in 2011 with South Korea, Panama and Columbia?\n\nIn 2008, Roger Bybee notes, then-presidential candidate Obama was highly critical of the way previous free-trade deals had been negotiated and implemented.\n\n\"Decades of trade deals like NAFTA and China have been signed with plenty of protections for corporations and their profits,\" Obama told auto workers in a Janesville, Wisc. campaign rally, \"but none for our environment or our workers who've seen factories shut their doors and millions of jobs disappear.\"\n\nDespite this 2008 campaign rhetoric, Bybee charges, Obama is now championing the very kind of trade deal he once excoriated – resorting to \"high-profile but hollow gestures\" on trade.\n\nMany left-wing critics of Obama may be tempted to agree with Bybee, seeing the TPP negotiations and other proposed Obama initiatives on trade as a simple selling out of the labor movement and the liberal environmental groups that contributed to Obama's election and reelection.\n\nArguably, though, socialists – even those who hasten to join with labor and the more progressive green groups in opposing the TPP – would do well to understand the roots of the President's apparent about-face, rather than simply being outraged by it.\n\nAccording to Prestowitz and to reporter Howard Schneider, author of a March 9 *Washington Post* article on Obama's new drive for free trade, there are at least two main factors now driving the administration's approach to trade.\n\nOne, as Prestowitz reports, is geopolitical in nature. With the rising economic and military power of China, the Obama administration has made a \"pivot to Asia\" a foreign policy priority.\n\n\"Some Southeast Asian and East Asian countries have been looking for assurances that the U.S. will remain engaged in the region and provide a countervailing power\" to China, Prestowitz writes.\n\nThe proposed TPP – which would include the United States and many of these Asian nations, but would not include China – is intended (along with an expanded US naval presence in the Western Pacific) to provide the smaller Asian nations with the reassurances they are seeking.\n\nThe other big factor behind Obama's push for the TPP and several other proposed free trade arrangements, according to Schneider, is economic. In part, new trade pacts are supposed to counteract \"sluggish job growth\" in the U.S. stemming from Obama's inability to promote a faster economic recovery in the face of GOP intransigence.\n\n\"Going through \\[the 2008 financial crisis\\] and recovery has pushed us all to focus on what it is we can do to create jobs and growth in every area of policy,\" Schneider quotes Obama's deputy national security advisor for international economics, Mike Froman, as saying.\n\nSchneider also quotes Obama's trade representative, Ron Kirk, as saying that \"in order to turn our economy around and make America a beacon for jobs, we could not win\" by only focusing production on the 5% of the global population residing in the United States. Wider markets evidently are needed.\n\nHowever, Schneider observes in the *Post* article, the TPP as envisioned today could well cost the United States additional jobs in basic manufacturing, while advancing U.S. economic interests in \"innovation, technology and high-end services.\"\n\nSchneider sees the pact as potentially increasing the ability of U.S. financial companies and consulting firms to penetrate foreign markets, while biotechnology firms obtain stronger patent protections and other high-tech US corporations enjoy more freedom \"to source their software and place their computers where it makes the most economic sense.\"\n\nYet at the same time, critics inside and outside of the labor movement fear that the pact could cost significant numbers of jobs in basic American industries such as paper production and shoe manufacturing.\n\nAccording to Prestowitz's *Washington Monthly* article, the TPP could cause the loss of 170,000 of the remaining US jobs in textile manufacturing, while ironically also undermining the Caribbean Basin Free Trade Agreement (CBFTA) and displacing some 1.2 million textile workers in the islands – who like their US counterparts could lose out to fierce Vietnamese competition.\n\n**What We Can Do:**\n\nThe Citizens Trade Campaign, a diverse coalition of progressive interest groups formed in 1992 to oppose NAFTA, is urging individuals to write to Congress and the White House to oppose \"fast track\" treatment for the TPP this year. To sign up online, contact the CTC site at this web address: [*http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1034/p/dia/action/public/?action\\_KEY=12495*](http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1034/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=12495)\n\nOn March 4, CTC also coordinated the submission of [*a letter to Congress*](http://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/CivilSocietyLetteronFastTrackandTPP_030413.pdf) urging a cautious rather than a \"fast-track\" approach to the TPP and demanding that this and other trade pacts signed by the United States respect eight principles. These include (1) prioritization of human and labor rights; (2) respect for local development goals and the procurement policies that deliver on them; (3) no elevation of corporations to equal terms with governments; (4) protection of food sovereignty; (5) maintaining access to affordable medication; (6) safeguards against currency manipulation; (7) space for robust financial regulations and public services; and (8) improved consumer and environmental standards.\n\nThe CTC letter also outlines ways to increase public participation and Congressional oversight in trade policy-making through replacement of \"outdated and extreme procedures like \"Fast Track,\" also known as the \"Trade Promotion Authority.\" This is a Nixon-era trade agreement approval procedure that enables proposed trade pacts to circumvent ordinary Congressional review, amendment and debate procedures.\n\n\n\nSigners of the CTC letter included roughly 100 national organizations (including DSA and Jobs with Justice) and another 300 or so local and regional civil society organizations in the U.S, which together claim to represent more than 15 million members.\n\nOrganizations of note that signed the letter include the United Mine Workers, the United Auto Workers, the American Postal Workers Union, United Steel Workers, AFGE, Communications Workers of America, National Nurses United, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and a half-dozen additional international unions in the AFL-CIO; a range of environmental groups including the Sierra Club and the Rainforest Action Network; a half-dozen or more progressive religious denominations ranging from the Unitarian Universalists and United Church of Christ to Pax Christi and the Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns; several US organizations expressing solidarity with Latin America, and such family farm advocacy groups as the National Farmers Union and National Family Farm Coalition.\n\n**Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch also is spearheading opposition to the TPP and is specifically urging all Americans to write to their US senators requesting copies of the draft text of the treaty – a key demand considering the extreme secrecy with which TPP negotiations have been shrouded.\n\nFor details, see [*http://action.citizen.org/p/dia/action/public/?action\\_KEY=12152*](http://action.citizen.org/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=12152).

Byerly","body":"When Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Julius Genachowski announced his resignation from the Commission March 18, no one was surprised. Genachowski had openly discussed his intent to leave since fall 2012.\n\nAnd, no one is happier to see him leave than those of us who believe that communication policies should be written to serve the public interest. Genachowski, a former venture capitalist, technology executive and personal friend of President Obama, was not in the public interest frame of mind in his three years as FCC head.\n\nHe never tried to hide his pro-business inclinations, which have even been reported widely by the mainstream media. A strong proponent of wireless technologies, Genachowski advocates reallocating a sizable portion of the broadcast airwaves (a public resource) for broadband and cell phone signals. That would shift substantial access to the airwaves away from \"the people\" and to private telecomm companies for their use in profit-generating services. The telecommunications industry is already the second highest revenue producing sector, right behind the pharmaceutical companies. Telecomm companies' influence in politics is already hegemonic.\n\nMost recently, Genachowski advocated relaxing cross-ownership regulations that keep one company from owning both newspapers and television stations in the same market. Right after he began to talk about this behind the scenes last fall, one major local newspaper reportedly began preparing to purchase a local TV station. Genachowski had let it be known that he planned to move the issue to a vote \"early in 2013,\" but to date that has not happened. He already had three votes (on the five-member FCC), he said, one of them his.\n\nConcerned about the possibility of such a vote, civil rights groups held a closed-door meeting at the Urban League in December to discuss issues and strategy around the cross-ownership situation. A Howard University colleague and I attended and shared our own concerns about such further deregulation on the heels of a November 2012 FCC report showing that minority and female broadcast ownership had declined through mergers and acquisitions unleashed since the Telecomm Act of 1996. African Americans presently own only 1.7 percent of FM and 2.8 percent of AM stations, a medium that served as a major source of information and cohesion through Civil Rights days and since. After that meeting many of us present, including myself and my colleagues in the Howard Media Group (HMG), submitted letters to the FCC asking for the cross-ownership ban to remain intact. To date, the issue remains on hold. (Note: See our HMG comment on this issue at [*www.howardmediagroup.org*](http://www.howardmediagroup.org) under \"policies and resources.\")\n\nUnder Genachowski's leadership, the FCC also refused to address the court-mandated requirement to consider remedies to declining broadcast ownership rates by women and minorities. The Third Circuit Court in Philadelphia had issued that *Prometheus II* ruling in July 2011, requiring the FCC to consider more than 40 remedies that had been submitted by civil rights groups like the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council. The FCC said that it had insufficient data from current research to show which remedies would be best, but to date the body has refused to commission those studies to obtain a baseline of data to aid its decision making.\n\nJournalists covering the FCC have been speculating about possible successors in the months since November 2012 when the chairman began to talk of leaving. In March, my Howard Colleague Clint Wilson and I submitted our letter to President Obama for one of those individuals, Catherine Sandoval. Sandoval is a law professor at University of Santa Clara and a commissioner on the California Public Utilities Commission, an appointment of Gov. Jerry Brown. She has strong credentials: BA from Yale, MA from Oxford (the first Latina to win a Rhodes scholarship), JD from Stanford, five years as an FCC attorney. In her academic life, she conducts legal research on minority and media issues and she actively engages issues in media policy from a public interest perspective. The daughter of Mexican American parents who remains involved with her community, she would bring a wealth of understanding about what is needed to move telecommunications policy forward. See more at [*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine\\_Sandoval*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Sandoval).\n\nThere are many ways to think about this moment of transition at the FCC. Among the things that I have been pondering these last few days is that at least the FCC is finally on the mainstream news agenda! Mostly that incredibly important body has flown under the radar of reporters, who have told me the FCC is \"too complicated to report on.\" The result of that has been a major lack of public awareness about how hugely powerful media companies are shaping legislation, services, and our daily communicative lives. Neither have many socialists shown an interest in communications policy. The significant exception to this has been Theresa Alt of the Ithaca DSA group, who began to cover federal telecomm policy in her weekly public access TV show \"DSA Presents\" back in the 1990s. Members of the Ithaca DSA were also involved in challenging local public radio stations, which, among other things, refused to carry \"Democracy Now!\"\n\nMy personal hope is that our Metro-DC DSA group can turn a watchful eye toward the Commission and begin to inform ourselves of its work toward possible (at least occasional) involvement.","order":5},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—April 2013 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"April 2013","order":-1,"date":"2013-04-03","body":"**April Fool!

In late June the Star Democrat newspaper (based in Easton) reported that for the first time, a small and rather beautiful species of invasive insect, the emerald ash borer (EAB), had been discovered on the Eastern Shore, in Dorchester and Queen Anne's counties.\n\nThe ash borer, a native of Asia thought to have first arrived in the U.S. in wooden packaging materials in 2003, is smaller than a penny as an adult, with dark shiny green wings flecked with gold specks. By boring into the bark of ash trees and laying its eggs there, it can weaken and eventually kill affected trees. Currently the ash borer is found in 25 states, including Maryland and Virginia. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture projections, the EAB's effect on ash trees, if its spread across the country goes unchecked, could ultimately cause some $20 billion to $60 billion in damage to the national economy.\n\nIn the metropolitan Baltimore area alone, experts predict that the damage the insect does to ash trees could cost local residents as much as $223 million in time. In the City of Baltimore proper, where approximately 200,000 ash trees make up about 8-10% of the tree cover, the city forester estimates that ash borer control will ultimately will cost taxpayers around $1 million.\n\nAlong with individual homeowners with ash trees on their property, city officials hoping to eradicate the EAB or limit its effects currently face a choice of repeatedly treating trees with a chemical poison called emanectin benzoate,\" at a cost of $100 to $400 per tree, or alternatively having smaller ash trees cut down at a cost of several hundred dollars each. Whichever path is chosen, the city forester expects Baltimore, after spending a significant sum on EAB control, will still lose a significant fraction of its ash trees.\n\nUnfortunately, the emerald ash borer is far from the only exotic invasive species now causing significant economic damage in the wider metropolitan DC area.\n\nRecent news stories indicate that the invasive northern snakehead fish, a voracious predator that can decimate other species of fish and devastate local populations of crustaceans and amphibians, has now become firmly established along 60 miles of the Potomac River. The highly destructive zebra mussel, a species native to the Caspian Sea, has been present in northern Maryland since 2008 and recently has been found in the northern Chesapeake Bay. Zebra mussels, which first came to the U.S. in 1986 in the ballast water of visiting cargo ships, have since caused environmental and economic havoc in parts of the Great Lakes by filtering so many nutrients out of lake water that some commercially desirable fish species can't find enough to eat.\n\nIn the Great Lakes region, the mussels also are notorious for attaching themselves in huge numbers to the water intake pipes of municipal waterworks and nuclear power plants, drastically reducing their intake capacity and forcing city governments and private corporations to spend hundreds of millions of dollars removing them. What costs the zebra mussel could ultimately inflict on Maryland are still unknown.\n\nIn addition, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the Maryland Invasive Species Council list a host of other harmful invasive species and potential invasive species that threaten economic and other losses to the state. Noted examples include the kudzu vine, the gypsy moth, the invasive water weed hydrilla, the green crab, the maritime garden snail and the Japanese beetle. According to the Maryland Department of Agriculture, some 42,000 acres of hemlock forests in the northwest corner of the state are threatened by yet another invader, the tiny hemlock woolly adelgid or HWA, a native of Asia that first came to North America in the 1920s and to Maryland in the 1980s.\n\nAnother invasive species with its origins in the United States west of the Appalachians, the rusty crayfish, was probably first brought to Maryland as fish bait. It has been present in the Susquehanna River basin in northern Maryland since 2007: according to the Department of Agriculture, and is \"infamous for overrunning freshwater streams and lakes,\" where it can have \"devastating effect on native crayfishes, aquatic vegetation, fishes, and other stream species.\"\n\nThe European pine shoot beetle, a brown or black insect with a cylindrical body that is about as big as a match head as an adult, can cause \"serious decline of entire stands of trees\" by eating young pine shoots and laying its eggs in them, according to Maryland authorities. It was first introduced into the U.S. in 1992 and now exists in 17 states, including Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.\n\nWhat almost all of these destructive organisms have in common, although the commercial media rarely mention it, is that their expansion into new and unfamiliar environments where they escape control by natural predators has been heavily dependent on the progress of capitalist trade, capitalist investment, and capitalist transportation technologies.\n\nCapitalist society, as professional biologists recognize, did not itself invent the problem of invasive species. The process of plant and animal species evolving in particular geographical areas and then migrating into different ones, where a few of them explode in numbers and disrupt the environment, probably has been going on for millennia. It may have begun shortly after the super-continent of Pangaea began breaking up into separate continents and islands some 240 million years ago, thus fostering the evolution of new plant and animal species in ecosystems newly isolated from each other. Through subsequent migrations of seeds, spores and adult organisms facilitated by wind, water and other mechanisms, some species may have been gradually working to reconnect the world's disconnected land masses ever since.\n\nWith the evolution of more or less modern humans over the last 400,000 years or so, and the migration of our distant ancestors out of Africa to the far corners of the planet over many thousands of years, the migration of disruptive non-human species into new areas probably accelerated. Environmentalist Chris Bright, in his 1998 book *Life Out of Bounds: Bioinvasion in a Borderless World*, notes that \"Nearly everywhere, invasion \\[of unfamiliar environments by exotic organisms\\] has been, in varying degrees ... a standard feature of the human past.\" But the development of modern capitalism since the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance has super-charged the process, Bright indicates, making the process of species transfer and ecological disruption much faster than before, and far more common.\n\nAs Bright puts it, \"Biotic mixing on a global level began in earnest general five centuries ago, as the Age of Discovery dawned. It is reaching its logical extreme today, in the emergence of a global economy. At its current level ... bioinvasion has become another way of measuring the unsustainability of the contemporary economic order.\"\n\nFive centuries ago is roughly when Columbus \"discovered\" the Americas and initiated the European (initially, just the Spanish) colonization of the New World. It is also roughly when the Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama found a sea route from Western Europe southward around the tip of Africa into the Indian Ocean, and from there northward to the Indian port of Surat, in a voyage that became the foundation for Portugal's establishment of a commercial empire in Africa and Asia.\n\nIn the view of many economic historians, including Adam Smith in his classic work *The Wealth of Nations*, the evolution of modern capitalism out of the vigorous commercial society of the European Renaissance took a big leap forward due to the discoveries of Columbus and da Gama and other European explorers. Smith wrote that the two explorers, by forging new trading links among Europe, Asia and the Americas, together laid the foundations for a truly global economy that, by fostering a more advanced division of labor and creating new export markets for surplus goods of both West and East, would vastly improve average labor productivity on a global scale, thus making possible eventual prosperity for all.\n\nMore critical observers have noted that the Age of Discovery was soon followed by the establishment of large European empires, the flourishing of the brutal Atlantic slave trade and the creation of new plantation-based economies in the New World that relied extensively on imported slave labor and that of white indentured servants. For generations, socialists and other progressives have been lamenting the horrifying human costs of these developments.\n\nYet as Bright's *Life Out of Bounds* indicates, and as environmental historian Alfred Crosby also wrote in *Ecological Imperi*alism, the rise and fall of large European empires and the continuing evolution of a world market since the Age of Discovery have had striking ecological impacts, not just human ones.\n\nIn colonizing the Americas, the Spanish conquistadores and later European intruders also introduced into new American environments such species as European rabbits, rats, cats, dogs, goats, sheep, cattle, horses, pigs, honeybees and clover, among other disruptive invasive organisms ranging from dandelions and stinging nettles to Old World peach trees, wild oats, and mustard. Upon arriving in the Americas, these and other newcomers quickly displaced many established plant and animal species.\n\nEuropean colonists, both by bringing their own Old World diseases to the New World and by importing slaves to the Americas from malaria-infested areas of Africa, also accidentally insured that Old World diseases fatal to humans would arrive.\n\nWithout denying or excusing the violence, greed and cruelty of the early conquistadores, Crosby and Bright argue that it was mostly Old World diseases that triggered a catastrophic decline in the indigenous populations of North and South America in the first century following the Spanish conquests. In this brief period, Bright states, \"as many as two thirds of the western hemisphere's native inhabitants – perhaps 30 million people – may have succumbed to smallpox, malaria and other Old World diseases.\"\n\nThe smallpox virus had long been present in the Old World, Crosby notes in Ecological Imperialism, but for some reason smallpox epidemics only reached crisis proportions in Europe over approximately three centuries from the 1500s through the mid-1700s. However, while the disease was a great killer of children, European adults living in ports where they experienced repeated exposures were relatively resistant to it. As colonial expansion occurred, however, European sailors inadvertently carried the disease to people in the Americas who were not resistant. The result was demographic disaster.\n\nFrom its 1519 arrival in the Caribbean through the start of the twentieth century, Crosby writes, smallpox \"played as essential a role in the advance of white imperialism overseas as gunpowder.\" Accidentally introduced into Mexico in the early 1500s, ahead of the conquest of Tenochitlan by Cortes, \"the disease exterminated a large fraction of the Aztecs and cleared a path for ... the founding of New Spain.\" In Peru, similarly, the virus caused severe population losses and spread chaos and civil war in the Incan Empire before the arrival of Francisco Pizarro, so that his apparently miraculous victories over the Incas were \"in large part\" the triumphs of smallpox.\n\nCrosby argues further that smallpox infections also spread very rapidly to other densely occupied parts of the Amerindian New World, possibly ranging \"from the Great Lakes to the pampa \\[in Argentina\\]\" by 1530. He hypothesizes that it was smallpox, again, that devastated the complex civilization of the Mound Builders in the present-day U.S. by 1540.\n\nAt the same time European explorers and conquerors were both deliberately and accidentally introducing Old World organisms into the New World, there was a large flow of organisms native to the New World in the opposite direction. Such plants as \"Indian corn\" or maize, tobacco, potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, chocolate, and eventually Brazilian rubber and quinine are among the prime examples.\n\nBasically capitalist trade under colonial auspices also resulted in Europeans establishing sugar cane, coffee and tobacco plantations in the Caribbean and Latin America, while importing significant volumes of silver, gold, seal furs, beaver furs, whale oil, timber and codfish from the Americas. Colonial trade over the next few centuries also dealt in ivory, slaves, ostrich feathers, dye woods and other products from Africa; in jute, indigo, spices and cotton calicoes from India; in cloves and other spices from what is now Indonesia, and in tea, silk and porcelain from China.\n\nFar more so than any other period of similar length in history, therefore, the past 500 years since Columbus's voyage have featured an enormous global remixing of plant and animal species previously separated by geological forces and geographic isolation.\n\nFor the first several centuries following the Age of Discovery, this remixing was carried out largely by what was then the world's most advanced long-distance transportation technologies, ocean-going wooden sailing vessels whose design, average speeds and cargo capacities steadily improved over time thanks to the ingenuity of European ship builders. Such ships, whose wooden hulls were vulnerable to burrowing insects and marine organisms, and which carried loads of rocks, dirt and other heavy materials as ballast, were themselves efficient carriers of weed seeds, microbes, and rats and mice into new environments. However, they were relatively slow by modern standards and hence formed a barrier to the global transmission of fast-developing diseases and other organisms incapable of surviving extended ocean voyages.\n\nSince the development of the steam ship and the railway locomotive during the English Industrial Revolution, however, capitalist transportation technologies have radically improved in terms of speed and cargo-carrying capacity. Today, seeds of invasive weeds and adults and egg cases of invasive insects can travel hundreds of miles almost overnight by hitchhiking rides on passing automobiles, long-distance trucks and railroad cars. Human disease organisms like the Ebola virus, the cholera bacteria and the SARS virus can travel thousands of miles by jet airliner, in many cases before their victims begin to display symptoms.\n\nModern cargo ships and oil tankers made of metal no longer transmit barnacles, insects, weed seeds and other hitchhiker organisms in their hulls as readily as wooden vessels once did, Bright notes. But at the same time, the cargo holds of modern commercial and naval vessels are much larger than those of the old wooden sailing ships, which means they have more room for hitchhiker species, particular those hidden away inside sealed freight containers.\n\nBright comments: \"Containers are nearly ubiquitous; they move by ship, rail, and road. They can be stacked for weeks or even months in ports or railyards, allowing plenty of time for pests to enter. They offer a safe haven to anything that manages to get inside, since they are very difficult to inspect. They are rarely cleaned between shipments, and they may not be unpacked until they are hundreds of miles from their ports of entry.\"\n\nAccordingly, Bright reports that shipping containers have been identified as \"significant pathways for insects, weed seeds, slugs, and snails.\" Their deadliest and most notorious hitchhiker species to date, though, may be the Asian tiger mosquito, a major carrier of Dengue fever and at least 17 other vector-borne diseases, including different kinds of encephalitis and yellow fever. Before the mid-1980s the mosquito was already common throughout much of the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean region stretching from Madagascar to Hawaii, but in the 1980s it then went on what Bright calls a voyage of \"world conquest\" by riding to new environments in shipping containers holding used rubber tires. By the time Bright's book appeared in 1998, it had established itself in such new environments as southern Europe, South Africa, Nigeria, New Zealand and Australia, Brazil, and the southeastern U.S.\n\nUnlike wooden sailing ships that used rocks, dirt and other materials for ballast, modern tankers have huge ballast tanks that take in seawater when more weight is needed for stability, such as when a ship is unloading. The ballast tanks then release this water when the ships need to shed weight, such as when they are loading fuel or cargo. Accordingly, ballast tanks have now become major transmitters of hitchhiker organisms.\n\nAs Bright reports, \"the ballast capacity of a big tanker can exceed 200,000 cubic meters – enough to fill 2,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.\" Accordingly, modern commercial tankers can move enormous volumes of invasive organisms into unfamiliar environments through the uptake and discharge of ballast water. The world's merchant marine fleet, which by the late 1990s was covering some 20,500 \"ton miles\" annually in terms of freight voyages, thus has created a series of \"meta-currents\" in the oceans rivalling the natural ones, Bright argues. On any day taken at random, Bright believes these meta-currents carry \"perhaps\" 3,000 different species of hitchhiker organisms, ranging from pathogenic microbes and green plants to carnivores and scavengers.\n\nThe zebra mussel is one of the most notorious invasive species transported via ballast water. Others, Bright reports, include a North American bristle worm now well established on the Baltic Sea coast of Poland; a North American jellyfish called Leidy's comb jelly, which has \"devastated\" the fisheries of the Black Sea; a starfish from the coasts of the Northwestern U.S. that has threatened local shellfish industries off the coasts of Tasmania; and poisonous dinoflagellate or \"red tide\" plankton from Japan that now sometimes shut down oyster production in parts of Australia.\n\nIn addition to the spread of harmful invasive species being accelerated by the modern shipping industry, the passenger airline business and the global tourism industry, Bright reports, the problem of \"bioinvasion\" also is promoted by commercial timber plantations, both in the temperate zone and the tropics; by global commerce in exotic pets and horticultural products; and by commercial shrimp farming in many locales.\n\nIt also is encouraged by modern industrial-style agriculture, which in many ways is inherently dependent on exotic and artificially \"invasive\" species such as Old World varieties of wheat, hybrid and genetically engineered varieties of New World maize, and a rather limited selection of rice, oats and other grains. The fact that most commercial crop species are grown in monocultures, in huge fields of genetically identical organisms, makes them unusually vulnerable to predation by insects and competition from various weeds.\n\nThe industrial use of DDT and other chemical pesticides over the past two generations to kill pest species in agriculture has resulted in many of them evolving natural abilities to resist the pesticide, Bright indicates. For this and other reasons, the total number of pest species affecting global agriculture is growing, not shrinking. Writing in 1998, Bright noted that \"Some 70,000 pest species are already attacking crops, but new ones are entering the system all the time and it is never certain where they will end up.\" This makes industrial scale agriculture, too, a major force promoting bioinvasions.\n\n\"As ecological entities,\" Bright concludes, \"the continents are coming together again; the seas are spilling into one another ... Modern commerce is wrapping the world's natural systems in a web of connections that is far more comprehensive than anything that could have existed on the ancient super-continent. A kind of hyper-Pangaea is emerging.\" This \"effective collapse of the world's ecological barriers is a phenomenon,\" he adds, that is \"so far as we know, without precedent in the entire history of life.\"\n\nWhat this global phenomenon means for the future of Maryland communities already affected by the emerald ash borer, the zebra mussel and other invasive species is not clear. The local economic damage that invasive species causes to Marylanders so far seem serious, but hardly overwhelming. But Bright concludes that on a worldwide scale, and at its current accelerated pace, the process of bioinvasion \"is no more sustainable than are current levels of deforestation or atmospheric carbon emissions,\" primarily because of the damage bioinvasions do to biological diversity. To use a badly mangled metaphor, therefore, Baltimore's expenses for emerald ash borer control may resemble the proverbial canaries that miners used to carry to detect dangerous methane levels in coal mines. Whatever damage the EAB inflicts on the ash trees of Baltimore is likely just a harbinger of other invasive species problems yet to come, social and public costs yet to be determined.","order":0},{"title":"BACK IN CHARM CITY: Baltimore DSA Launches Sept. 20","date":"2015-09-07","issue":"September 2015","author":"Jonathan Phipps","body":"Come join us Sunday, Sept. 20 at 2 p.m. for an open house and kickoff event for the Baltimore chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).

In addition to her labor organizing, Huerta made substantial contributions to the movements for Latino/Latina rights and for women's empowerment, as an exhibition at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery makes clear.\n\n\"[*One Life: Dolores Huerta*](http://www.npg.si.edu/exhibit/exhhuerta.html)\" is a small exhibit – its approximately three dozen photos and artifacts fit neatly into one modest-sized gallery – but it is rich in images and memorabilia that tell the story of one of the significant labor leaders of our time. The earliest photo is of a seven-year-old Huerta with her brother in California, and the exhibit traces her life through her being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama in 2012. The medal itself is displayed next to a photo of the president awarding the medal to Huerta, who is smiling like one of life's winners.\n\nShe has a right to smile, for over her 85 years Huerta – who is an honorary chair of Democratic Socialists of America – fought and overcame obstacles one by one. She rose from an impoverished childhood in rural California to become a co-founder of the Community Services Organization, one of the earliest Mexican-American self-help organizations. It was through the CSO that she became acquainted with Chavez, and the two founded the National Farm Workers Association – the predecessor to UFW – in 1962. Chavez initially discouraged Huerta from playing such a large role over concern that her domestic responsibilities – she was at this point divorced with two daughters – would distract her from union duties. Huerta, however, was not deterred. In the photos from these years her expression is determined and focused, including a shot of the founding convention of NFWA in which men cluster around Huerta to sign up for the union.\n\nIn the NFWA and later the UFW, the charismatic Chavez was the spokesman and public face of the union, while Huerta handled public relations and other organizational duties. But she sometimes stepped into the spotlight, where she often spoke to female workers – as she is pictured in the exhibit – and served as a special inspiration to women seeking, like Huerta, to balance activism and family. She also was a fierce negotiator at the bargaining table, leading one grape grower to grouse, \"Dolores Huerta is crazy. She is a violent woman, where women, especially Mexican women, are usually peaceful and calm.\"\n\nThe exhibit doesn't hide the difficulty and danger Huerta faced as a labor activist. She often lived hand-to-mouth and relied on donations of food and clothing from union members. One member knitted her a sweater emblazoned with the UFW \"black eagle,\" and the exhibit features both a photo of her wearing the sweater, and the sweater itself. A 1988 photo shows a grim-looking Huerta in the hospital, Chavez by her side, after she was beaten by San Francisco police during a demonstration and suffered a ruptured spleen and fractured ribs. She was eventually awarded an $825,000 settlement, and the incident led the San Francisco police to revamp their crowd-control procedures.\n\nBut there also are images of triumph, including the events leading to UFW's successfully achieving a contract with California grape growers in 1970. While Chavez embarked on a 25-day hunger strike in 1968 to dramatize the farm workers' plight, Huerta worked the media and the political establishment. Two photos in the gallery show Huerta with Robert Kennedy as Chavez ended his fast.\n\nA silkscreen portrait of Huerta by Barbara Carrasco captures its subject's essence: kindly yet firm, visionary yet down-to-earth. Or perhaps Huerta's own words, printed on the gallery wall, capture her best: \"Don't be a marshmallow. Walk the street with us into history. Get off the sidewalk. Work for justice.\"\n\n\"One Life: Dolores Huerta\" will be at the National Portrait Gallery until May 15, 2016.","order":3},{"title":"FORWARD TOGETHER FOR DAYS OF GRACE: A Long March for Justice Continues","date":"2015-09-07","issue":"September 2015","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"Labor Day has sometimes been a militant demonstration in solidarity with striking workers, sometimes used to proclaim the beneficence of corporate capital. At times a vehicle for expressions of independent worker political action, more often it has been a tool for mainstream politicians to talk without substance about popular need. Occasionally used to express opposition to war, commonly it is turned into a holiday to celebrate \"Americanism.\" Frequently a fun parade or time for a family outing, the holiday's history thus ignored, the day marking the transition from summer to autumn with back-to-school sales, and final seasonal trips to the beach. Or, in other words, Labor Day reflects the changing trends in US society and attitudes amongst union members. So it is little wonder that this year the holiday has become an opportunity to forcefully and publicly connect demands for economic, social and racial justice – to assert workers' voice in the fight to give meaning to a democratic system under assault from all sides.\n\nJust such a connection is being made by Local 1442 of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) which issued a call for a Labor Day action in its home city of Charleston, South Carolina in response to the mass shooting of parishioners at the \"Mother Emanuel\" AME Church in June and the police slaying of Walter Scott in April. The call states in part:\n\nGuns inflicted the fatal wounds of April and June, but racism, poverty and the politics of rancor and discord have long inflicted grave wounds on the state's poor and most vulnerable people. This Labor Day weekend, people of faith and conscience will come together in Charleston to remember our fallen friends and to reflect on the racism and hatred that lay at the root of their deaths, as well as the violence that tears away at the fabric of our communities.\n\nSpecifically, the gathering will call for an end to racist violence and the transformation of our commemorative landscape – our monuments, markers and historic sites — to fully reflect South Carolina's traditions of diversity and democracy. We will also come together to honor Clementa Pinckney and to affirm the moral principles that he stood for as pastor and public servant. These include:\n\nAn end to discriminatory policing Expanded voting rights A living wage and collective bargaining rights for all working people Affordable healthcare and Medicaid expansion Quality education as a basic human right An end to gun violence. . . .\n\nIf you believe that an injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and if you understand that what happened at Emanuel AME has implications far beyond Charleston, and if you believe that we can build a movement together to save South Carolina's soul and the soul of the nation, then join us as we proclaim \"Forward Together, Not One Step Back.\"\n\n\"Forward together\" is the watchword of the movement that emerged in North Carolina in 2013 after that state's legislature used the Supreme Court's elimination of key enforcement provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act to pass one of the most restrictive voting laws in the country. Such restrictions disproved the argument that federal voting rights protections were not necessary –but of course, the local power structures that sought their elimination knew that full well. Moral Monday demonstrations, organized by the NAACP in alliance with a host of labor, civil rights, women's, student, faith-based and other organizations have taken place weekly since then throughout the state. Currently, the NAACP and its allies are in the midst of an 860-mile national march. Begun August 1 in Selma, Alabama and now in North Carolina where marchers will rally and demonstrate up through Labor Day. They will then continue until they reach the Halls of Congress in Washington DC on September 16. This \"Journey for Justice\" is advocating the following:\n\nthe right of every American to a fair criminal justice system\n\nuncorrupted and unfettered access to the ballot box\n\nsustainable jobs with a living wage\n\nequitable public education\n\nDemands that are similar to those in Charleston because the needs of working people in North Carolina, South Carolina, and across the nation are similar. And, although expressing the needs of the present, they also draw on the history of movements to defend democracy by fighting racism and exploitation. One of the initiators and principal leaders of the Moral Monday movement, Rev. William Barbour of the NAACP, in a tribute to Julian Bond, spoke of today's struggles as a continuation of those in the past. Noting that the first Reconstruction – begun during the Civil War and buried with the 1896 *Plessy vs. Fergusson* case which allowed for the legal apartheid Jim Crow system of segregation, and the Second Reconstruction – begun when activists took to the streets to make real the Supreme Court's *Brown v. Board of Education* in 1954. That ruling undid the legal basis for such segregation but was then buried under the weight of the racist \"Southern Strategy\" of George Wallace and Richard Nixon. It left tasks unfinished – and so created the need for a Third Reconstruction; Barbour reminds of what that legacy consists:\n\nWhen Black soldiers came home from Vietnam describing the atrocities they had seen the U.S. commit against the tiny country's non-white peasants, it was not long for Julian and SNCC to begin protesting these atrocities. Soon the Georgia Legislature, dripping with the money being spent by the U.S. military across Georgia, decided Bond's truth-telling could not be tolerated in the legislature and ejected him from his hard-won seat. Without skipping a beat, Julian and SNCC took the attack on him as an opportunity for turning the*southern U.S.*anti-racism movement into a*southern hemisphere*movement against the racist policies of the U.S. and European nations toward native, non-whites....\n\nAmericans are the targets of a conscious dumbing down by tea party extremists, who are dependent on their twisted versions of world events and history. Their cruel policies would be immediately rejected if our kids were taught accurate history in our public schools. This problem led to Julian's full support of the*Eyes on the Prize*film....\n\nBrother Bond, in 1998, was persuaded to lead 64 civil rights veterans who sit on the Board of Directors of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Julian Bond never let us down in our efforts in North Carolina to revive SNCC's strategy of non-violent direct action from the moral high ground. He gave us confidence to experiment with different ways to welcome our Brown and White sisters and brothers to the central struggle against racism....\n\nNow, Brother Julian, you get a well-deserved rest. ... You will be present within us as we walk in the NAACP's*Journey for Justice*through North Carolina on the way to D.C. to demand a comprehensive Voting Rights Act, that five Justices—liquidating history—eviscerated a couple of years ago. As the Journey passes ALEC's offices in Northern Virginia, a factory of poisonous boiler-plates of cruel laws for southern states to pass against the poor, disenfranchised, poorly schooled, LGBTQ, labor, immigrants, women, and every group of people excluded from accumulating capital in the avaricious economic-political system that is playing its trump card once again, you will be with us. We can hear you saying from the clouds: AMERICA. Shuffle the letters and you get: I AM RACE.\n\nThe history of the Civil Rights movement is not a history of constant advance, of constant victory. Defeats came often, because the strength of the existing power structure made it hard to maintain unity, made it difficult to determine when to compromise, when to stand firm, how to build coalitions. Yet it is a history filled with real victories from which people can learn – as the Journey for Justice and the Call for Grace each reflect. Significant in both is the central role labor unions are playing, a role they have not always played.\n\nIn the late 19<sup>th</sup>, early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, many unions in the South wanted to drive blacks out of the work force, and most accommodated themselves to the privileged side of disunity once segregation became the law of the land. But there was ever and again resistance to such a world. African American longshore workers in the turn of the century created the basis of for a united black and white union within the AFL in New Orleans at the height of the era of lynching and repression. Yet though striving for unity, they refused to be silent about their own dignity – and so when, in 1902, the Central Labor Council organized a whites only Labor Day, a Black Labor Day parade was also organized for a number of years. Meanwhile, any cracks in the wall of exclusion were seized upon, as when the New Orleans building trades held a joint black-white Labor Day parade in 1910, and when the Socialist Party organized a mass rally of black and white workers on behalf of the McNamara Brothers (arrested in 1911 for using dynamite during a California strike). The interracial ILA – apart from the miners unions, the only such AFL union at the time in the deep South — survived numerous conflicts and attempts to break its unity and strength up until the Depression. Later in the 1930s, Communists and other radical leftists in the National Maritime Union insisted on integrated union hiring halls throughout the country, where it was unpopular and where it was illegal to do so, and fought off police, vigilantes, gangsters and employers to uphold the practice. Although the unity in struggle suffered a setback during the early years of McCarthyism and the Cold War, the labor/civil rights nexus gained a new lease on life during the Second Reconstruction Rev. Barbour spoke about – as witnessed in Charleston itself after a successful three month strike led by Local 1199 organized the city's hospital workers in 1969.\n\nAll this forms the background to the militancy of Kenneth Riley and his fellow dockworkers, despite conservative times and a conservative national union. In 2001, when challenging the lack of democracy in the ILA, and its related neglect of the interests of black workers because the union refused to confront the threats posed by global capital, Local 1422 members protested non-union work performed om the Charleston waterfront. Provocations led to picket line battles with the police – and the arrest of Riley and 4 other dock workers. A solidarity campaign ensued, the 5 were eventually cleared of all charges. Riley went on to become president of the Local, an International Vice President of the ILA, and still a fighter for union democracy and union defense of workers' rights on and off the job. It is this background that led to the call for action after the murder of nine church goers.\n\nBut the Labor Day rally is not only a call for abstract ideological reason. One of the local's 800 members lost a son and an aunt in the massacre at Emanuel A.M.E. Another member is the brother of Walter Scott, the Black motorist who was shot in the back by a North Charleston policeman April 4. It is that reality which all labor should remember this Labor Day and all days thereafter, while heeding Riley's words to an ILA national convention:\n\nWe cannot simply mourn the dead and talk about reform – we must act and these Days of Grace is a powerful demonstration of action.\n\nAction that returns meaning to Labor Day by organizing to end the \"racism and hatred ... the violence that tears away at the fabric of our communities.\n\n\n\nQuotes:\n\nILA Local 1442:\n\nCharleston's Days of Grace Call to Action — [***http://www.daysofgracecharleston.org/***](http://www.daysofgracecharleston.org/)\n\n\n\nAmerica's Journey for Justice List of Demands:\n\nNorth Carolina NAACP — [*http://www.naacpnc.org/journey\\_about*](http://www.naacpnc.org/journey_about)\n\n\n\nRev.

Penguin Press, New York, 2015.\n\nAt a time when race and racism are front and center in the national conversation, a book about the racial politics of nearly two centuries ago and how it helped build the America we know today – for both good and ill – could not be more timely.\n\nAnd for socialists, the book shows that the quest for profit among white elites, while not the whole story, was certainly a major factor in the rise of racism in America and its persistence today. From slavery to Jim Crow, to Native American removal and extermination, to scapegoating of Latino immigrants – all of these systems flourished in part because there was money to be made in them.\n\n*Jacksonland*, a lively and well-researched book by National Public Radio reporter Steve Inskeep, shows how the early-19<sup>th</sup> century drive to remove Native Americans from the eastern United States – focusing on the Cherokees – was animated at least as much as lust for their desirable land holdings as out of pure racial hatred.\n\nFor those interested in the story of the Cherokees and their removal from the East, *Jacksonland* fits neatly on the shelf beside Brian Hicks' engaging and well-written *Toward the Setting Sun: John Ross, the Cherokees and the Trail of Tears* from 2011. Both books bring to light the story of Ross, whose life was previously as little-known as it is fascinating. Although mostly of white ancestry (he was only one-eighth Cherokee), Ross came to fully identify with the Cherokee Nation. His education and knowledge of American government led his people to elevate him to chief, where he attempted to use the white legal system against itself to preserve his people and their lands.\n\nWhile Hicks' book mostly focused on Ross, Inskeep's eye is on Andrew Jackson and his decades-long campaign to drive Natives from the eastern half of the country. (Full disclosure: Inskeep and I are fathers of children who attended the same elementary school). Reading Hicks alone gives one the impression that Jackson's removal efforts were mostly a combination of racism and political ambition. But Inskeep documents another motive: Jackson was poised to make big profits by getting rid of the Cherokees. While serving as an officer in the Army and then in political office, Jackson was involved in removing Natives from their lands – by military force, treaty, coercion or trickery – and then using his connections to procure the land at favorable prices for himself or his friends and allies. Jackson \"participated in the biggest real estate bubble in the history of the nation up to that time,\" Inskeep writes. \"Some of his closest friends and allies would colonize the new country and be installed among its leading citizens. He was nation-building\" – by dispossessing the original inhabitants of the land.\n\nThe other major player, Chief Ross, despite his mostly white heritage, became the Cherokee's greatest defender. He doggedly insisted on the Cherokees' right to stay put, even as many members of the tribe were bought off and moved west, fearing the cause was lost in the long run – as indeed it was. But Ross operated at a time when Indian removal required at least a fig leaf of legality, and he was successful at gaining political allies and even winning a landmark Supreme Court case featuring an opinion by Chief Justice John Marshall that – if American democracy lived by its own principles –should have ensured that the Cherokees could keep their land into perpetuity. But Jackson responded to Marshall's decision by reputedly sneering \"Let him enforce it\" – possibly apocryphally, according to Inskeep, but the quote did reflect Jackson's thoughts and actions. In the end, the government bribed a band of Cherokees not representing Ross or his government to sign a removal treaty, and at that point the land rush was on and the Trail of Tears was at hand.\n\nInskeep's illumination of how money was at the root of Native American removal and genocide makes it a valuable addition to early American history. It also should fuel sentiment for removing Jackson's portrait from the $20 bill, which would be a measure of justice – too little, too late, but at least a recognition that Jackson is not the hero that standard histories have made him out to be.","order":6},{"title":"NOVEMBER DSA CONVENTION: Metro DC DSA Elects Delegates Sept. 13","date":"2015-09-07","issue":"September 2015","author":"David Duhalde","body":"The biennial Democratic Socialists of America Convention is happening this November 13-15 in Bolivar, Pennsylvania!

Unfortunately, the tone of his comments – which he delivered as \"Ben Schreiber,\" individual, and not on behalf of FOE-US — was not only pessimistic, but alarming.\n\nIf Schreiber is correct, progressives and green activists face enormous challenges in the years ahead in getting the U.S. to make the energy transitions necessary to head off ever-worsening climate change. What's more, current political and economic realities make it likely that the fossil fuel industry and the American economic elite will find ways to ensure that, if this society ever does anything significant about climate change, the wealthy will force the less well-off to pay for it — just as the U.S. government, at a serious risk to ordinary taxpayers, offered trillions of dollars in loan guarantees to the largest Wall Street banks when it tackled the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nYet for now, Schreiber indicated, the government's best climate action plan announced to date, even if it can be implemented fully, is inadequate to make the changes in greenhouse gas emissions needed to curb global climate change, no matter who pays the tab. Instead, in Schreiber's estimation, the plan President Obama intends to offer to the upcoming U.N. climate negotiation talks in Paris this December will continue to impose \"climate colonialism\" on the poorer and less-industrialized nations of the planet, while failing to limit average global temperatures to a level most climate scientists consider minimally acceptable.\n\nTo address the climate change crisis adequately, Schreiber told DSA members and supporters on Aug. 9, would take \"a transformation of our entire economy – energy, agriculture, forestry, transportation and other sectors.\" It also would entail significant changes in unsustainable, energy-intensive lifestyles now enjoyed by many Americans. But at the government level at this point, Schreiber stated, \"No one is talking about radical lifestyle changes; no one is talking about the rapid development of renewable energy that we would need\" to make the U.S. economic system environmentally sustainable.\n\nSchreiber spoke to us on Sunday, Aug. 9, less than a week after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released the so-called Obama Climate Plan for reducing CO2 emissions by the U.S. electric power industry.\n\nUnder a final EPA regulation promulgated on Aug. 3 — which already has been denounced as economically ruinous by Republican presidential candidates, and which is sure to face a flurry of lawsuits by affected industries — the various states would need to develop individual carbon emissions reduction programs that, by the target year 2030, would decrease total power plant carbon emissions in the U.S. by roughly 32 percent compared to 2005 levels. The new regulation would not require the states to begin implementing their new carbon emissions reduction programs until 2020, however, a deadline that the Obama administration and supporters say would give affected power plants and other industries ample time to adjust to the rules.\n\nIn announcing the new EPA regulation, White House advisor Brian Deese called the program \"the biggest step any single president has made to curb the carbon pollution that is fueling climate change.\" The President himself was cited by the BBC as characterizing the new regulation as one cornerstone of an attempt to ensure that the upcoming climate negotiations in Paris in early December will result, for the first time ever, in a global treaty under which all or most nations agree to take action to bring climate change under control.\n\n\"This is our moment to get something right ... for our children,\" the BBC on Aug. 3 quoted Obama as saying.\n\nUpon its release, the Obama Climate Plan also was praised by Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, by Sierra Club president Michael Brune, and by Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, among other talking heads for big American environmental groups. A spokesperson for U.N. General Secretary Ban Ki-moon told Reuters that the plan shows the kind of \"visionary leadership\" needed to make the Paris climate talks successful.\n\nOn the other hand, Aljazeera America reporter Ned Resnikoff on Aug. 3 quoted a spokesperson for Greenpeace as calling the plan \"an important step forward ... \\[but\\] woefully inadequate on its own.\" MSNBC, on Aug. 19, [*quoted prominent climate scientist James Hansen*](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obamas-climate-policy-practically-worthless-says-expert) of NASA as saying that Obama's actions are \"practically worthless\" and \"do nothing to attack the fundamental problem.\" And *Scientific American* contributor David Biello, on Aug. 6, called the greenhouse gas emission cuts mandated by the plan \"significant,\" but \"also not enough.\"\n\nIf the Obama Climate Plan survives challenges from Republicans, fossil fuel companies and electric utilities and is fully implemented, Biello wrote*,* carbon emissions from the U.S. electricity production sector as of the year 2030, when the plan is fully implemented, still will contribute 1.7 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere each year.\n\nThat's \"more than the combined emissions of the entire economies of Germany and the U.S. today,\" Biello noted. In addition, Biello's *Scientific American* piece stated, U.S. electric power plants fueled by natural gas-fueled in 2030 will still be emitting around 722 pounds of carbon dioxide for every megawatt of energy generated, which will add further to atmospheric CO2 burdens that drive destructive levels of climate change.\n\nBiello's *Scientific American* piece concluded: \"This plan is likely the most the US. can do given current political realities and therefore is an important step, but that doesn't mean it's sufficient.\"\n\nIn his remarks to DSA members, Schreiber echoed the tone of Biello's assessment, but with a little more emphasis on the negative. In particular, he mentioned two aspects of the plan that have been virtually ignored in the media, but that Schreiber believes should be of particular concern to socialists.\n\nThe Paris climate negotiation session in December is \"already scripted, and is about money,\" Schreiber said. The U.S., as the wealthiest capitalist nation on earth, can use its economic power to force smaller and less developed nations to accede to our climate policies. What the U.S. is essentially saying to such countries is \"this is not you what you need, but what we're willing to do, and you're going to live with it.\"\n\nElizabeth Kolbert in the New Yorker described the chief of the UN Framework Commission on Climate Change secretariat, Christiana Figueres of Costa Rica, as having a job with \"the very highest ratio of responsibility (preventing global collapse) with authority (practically none).\"\n\nSchreiber added that the total reductions in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that Obama is proposing, which Schreiber says would amount to a 28% reduction over 2005 levels by 2030, would not suffice to limit the rise in global average temperatures to just 2 degrees C over preindustrial levels — the maximum temperature increase that many climate scientists have said can avert serious climate disruptions. By way of contrast with what the climate scientists want, human civilization through its greenhouse gas emissions is currently on schedule to cause a rise in average global temperatures of up to 6 degrees C. However, the U.N. climate negotiations underway, along with the U.S. climate action plan, might limit the temperature rise to around 4 to 6 degrees C.\n\nUnfortunately, Schreiber said, this level of global warming would be disastrous for much of Africa, render much of Australia uninhabitable and cause disaster for low-lying island states already threatened by rising ocean levels.\n\nIn promising to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by only 28 percent, Schreiber said, the Obama plan would essentially force smaller and poorer nations in the less-developed world to \"become more green than we are.\" To help them bear the cost, richer nations are proposing an international climate finance mechanism that would insure a \"massive financial transfer to the rest of the world\" to allow the U.S. to \"continue our slow transition away from a financial fuel economy.\"\n\nWhether the financial transfer mechanism will be adequate, though, seems unlikely, and parties to the upcoming talks are arguing over how and when it would come into play. The U.S. wants developing nations to make commitments to CO2 reductions before receiving the money, while representatives of the developing nations want to receive the money before committing to reductions. Friends of the Earth in the United Kingdom has estimated that a \"fair share\" shift of financial resources to the developing world as part of a climate deal would cost $632 billion, or roughly $63.2 billion annually over a decade. Whether this much will be provided is unclear.\n\nOn the domestic front, Schreiber warned, there are two contrasting ways in which the U.S. might make its society and economy sustainable in terms of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. The one, politically unlikely path that socialists should support is a \"massive democratization of our entire economy,\" which among other things would involve massive development of distributed electricity production employing rooftop solar systems, as well as a concerted development of centralized electricity production from renewable energy as well. This path would preclude any rapid phasing out of existing nuclear power plants, to ensure that national greenhouse gas reductions are achieved in time.\n\nThe second, more politically likely way for the U.S. economy to become climate-friendly, Schreiber suggested, is through the continuing development of highly centralized energy production controlled by the rich, who could use the transition to more sustainable energy sources to ensure \"more capitalism.\" Meeting the climate challenge, in short, \"could be an opportunity to democratize our society, or it could be another case – like the financial crisis – in which we buy \\[the wealthy elites\\] out.\"\n\nWith this point in mind, Schreiber noted that the Carbon Tracker Initiative has identified some $3 trillion of wealth, of assets relating to fossil fuels, \"that is going to have to disappear if we are to solve climate change.\" If all of this $3 trillion in capital assets needs to be written off, \"who will be left holding the bag?\"\n\nSchreiber suggested that some of the big fossil fuel companies and their major investors, who in some cases may consist of union pension funds and other seemingly benign institutions, and not merely wealthy individuals, may well be counting on future government bailouts to get them to relinquish \"stranded investments\" in fossil fuels that need to be written off. He cited as an example Royal Dutch Shell Oil, which recently resigned its membership in the ultra-conservative, climate-denying American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) due to its supposed conversion to the idea that climate change is a pressing problem.\n\nYet despite its resignation from ALEC, Shell is going ahead with plans to drill for oil in the Chukchi Sea north of Alaska, Schreiber noted. It could be argued that this is an insanely reckless business decision, if Shell expects serious efforts by the nations of the world to reduce fossil fuel use to head off climate change. But it is possible that Shell and other large fossil fuel companies are anticipating that if they make bad, climate-destructive business investments now, the public will be forced to buy them out in the future, much as the U.S. government during the recent financial crisis bought out the big banks.\n\nIn terms of trying to head off the more elitist solution to climate crisis while facilitating a path involving democratization of the economy, Schreiber said, \"The best thing we have going for us is rooftop solar,\" particularly since private investors have found ways to earn profits from paying for individual homeowners to install such systems on their homes. But the private utility industry, seeing a threat to its own profits in this development, is working through ALEC to block rooftop solar installation by levying a \"line change\" on customers with rooftop solar systems to soak up all the economic benefits that can be gained from installing a rooftop solar system. Utility regulators in Arizona have approved such a system of line charges, and Schreiber implied that one major battle facing green energy advocates today lies in preventing other states from following Arizona's example.\n\nAnother big area where a popular fight against the fossil fuel companies is occurring concerns resource extraction activities, as demonstrated by current organizing campaigns against fracking and the Keystone XL pipeline, as well as Shell's drilling plans for the Arctic. Schreiber said the volume of potential CO2 reductions at stake in battles against resource extraction activities is not necessarily greater than reductions in CO2 emissions that might be gained in some other ways, but popular support for the anti-extraction fight makes it an obvious priority for activism.\n\nWhat areas of change are best to organize around? Schreiber named the military, the single biggest emission source; consumer behavior; airline emissions; and factory farming. In addition, climate justice campaigns against practices that impact vulnerable communities can gain public sympathy.\n\nThe grim reality is that \"nobody's talking about significant lifestyle changes,\" Schreiber said, even though there is no question that in the United States, at least, \"there's no question that our entire lifestyle is based on the exploitation of slave labor and the \\[unsustainable\\] use of cheap energy.\"\n\nIn reply to questions, Schreiber identified several progressive and helpful information sources about climate change and climate change activism that DSA members and other progressives might turn to for the latest climate developments. They include FOE-US itself, Greenpeace, the web site of 350.org, the Climate Justice Alliance, and the Labor Network for Sustainability. Schreiber also recommended the UK Guardian's recent series of articles on energy extraction, *Energy and Environment* (available only by paid subscription), The Smog Blog, and the Huffington Post. Other attendees at the meeting also recommended the online group SumofUs and *Power to the People.*","order":8},{"title":"ORGANIZING FOR THE FUTURE- Progressive Prince George's Introduces Itself","date":"2015-09-07","issue":"September 2015","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"*I was born by the river in a little tent Oh and just like the river I've been running ev'r since It's been a long time, a long time coming But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will*\n\nSam Cooke's lyrics, beautifully sung by meeting participant Jennifer Lucas, gave voice to the spirit that animated the nearly 100 participants – community and faith-based leaders, social justice and labor activists, and a few elected officials — at the Progressive Prince George's Launch Party and Interest Meeting. Held August 13 at the UFCW Local 400 Building in Landover, the event was sponsored by Progressive Maryland as a step toward building a unifying progressive organization in the county (similar initiatives will take place in Montgomery County and Baltimore). Issues such as the foreclosure crisis – which remains a crisis in the County especially amongst African American homeowners – inadequate public education, a broken criminal justice system and the lack of access to quality jobs are representative of the concerns that brought people to the meeting.\n\nAnd these were the concerns keynote speaker Pastor Delman Coates (Mt. Ennon Baptist Church) noted that he heard expressed multiple times during his travels through the state while running for Lt. Governor on Heather Mizeur's ticket in last year's gubernatorial race. A leader in the fight for civil rights, he also was a leader in the referendum campaign for marriage equality and in the current struggle for voting rights. In fact, during his speech, he urged all who could to attend his church the following Monday when Rep. John Lewis was to speak about the work done to win the Voting Rights Act in 1965 and the work still needed to maintain it today. He concluded with a moving remembrance, from the not so distant days of extreme poverty and segregation in the South, of a woman holding the door open at a bus rest stop so that youth who didn't have a dime could use the facilities. And that was the message: we must do all we can to open and hold open doors that still exclude if we are to have a just society and a true democracy.\n\nProgressive Maryland's interim Executive Director Larry Stafford spoke in a similar vein, pointing out that change comes about when we act, and he spoke of his own experience encountering police violence when still a teenager as pushing him into a life of activism – of speaking up and speaking out so that injustice never goes unchallenged. He talked of the need to change our country's priorities at home and abroad, by working for an alternative where we live. The goal, one activist wrote, was to \"fashion a self-managing populist organization concentrating on neighborhood issues and bringing accountability to local government.\"\n\nLocal activism and organizing was the heart of the meeting. Four Progressive Prince George's community leaders introduced and led breakout sessions on the priority campaigns:\n\n-   Better public and official control of police behavior, especially excessive force, uneven treatment of minorities, and resort to gunfire rather than calming situations. Activists involved in the PPG breakout session later testified to a [*General Assembly body considering changes*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/activists-want-changes-to-police-officers-bill-of-rights/2015/08/24/a9eac2ee-4a38-11e5-9f53-d1e3ddfd0cda_story.html) to the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights (LEOBOR), which famously has protected officers accused of unjustified killings in states and cities around the nation. Christian Gant and LaCole Foots led this session.\n\n-   Neighborhood control of appropriate development and improving the approval process for projects, which now can shut out affected neighborhoods in the county's relentless search for a commercial tax base. The immediate concern was a Walmart in a residential area along Annapolis Road, which organized neighbors are fighting before the District Council. Jennifer Dwyer led this session.\n\n-   A pending Paid Safe and Sick Leave bill that will come before the Prince George's County Council in September. A strong bill was passed in Montgomery County earlier this year with skilled advocacy from the statewide Working Matters Coalition, of which Progressive Maryland is a member. Activists seek an equally strong bill to set the stage in Maryland's two largest counties for advocacy on a statewide bill, the latest version of which will bring sick leave legislation before the General Assembly for the fourth consecutive year. Linda Saffel led this session.\n\n\n\nStafford, in a closing appeal, mentioned many other issues that the organization would tackle, including workers and human rights, income inequality, environmental justice, peace and alternative economics. But the focus, he said, will be developing a grassroots organization that allows Prince Georgians to work collectively on their frontline, local concerns. That organization, he said, needs to develop leaders while also always focused on maximum empowerment of people in their neighborhoods, to be self-motivated rather than top-down. From that, he said, would proceed the kind of popular pressure that could require accountability from public officials in the county and at the state level as well.\n\nMuch work remains to win those battles and to root the organization more solidly in the county. A hopeful sign of the potential to do just that was the presentation of two high school students at the meeting's end, with one – Juwan Blocker – declaiming a performance piece that spoke in equal parts of anger and hope. A poem expressing sentiments in parallel with the final verse of Sam Cooke's song written more than four decades ago:\n\n*There have been times that I thought I couldn't last for long But now I think I'm able to carry on It's been a long, a long time coming But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will*\n\n**Woody Woodruff contributed to this article**","order":9},{"title":"PERILOUS INSIGHTS- Violence and the Work of Women Journalists","date":"2015-09-07","issue":"September 2015","author":"Carolyn M.

Of those, the greatest number said these acts were perpetrated by their own supervisors or co-workers.\n\nThis shocking finding reveals the reality of women in journalism today – they have made their way into the male bastion of newsrooms, but they still are not welcome. Women's liberation has opened doors, but it has not yet eradicated deeply institutionalized sexism.\n\nRespondents to the IWMF study also said they encounter abuse from police and other officials they interact with in the course of reporting. More than a fifth said they had experienced physical violence in retaliation for what they had reported.\n\nThe stark episode of CBS reporter [*Lara Logan's*](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/committee-to-protect-journalists/lara-logan-sees-parallels_b_1638682.html) on-camera sexual assault by a crowd of men as she covered protests in Tahrir Square in Cairo in 2011 makes these numbers real, as does a similar brutal attack against British journalist Natasha Smith soon after. Both women detailed their accounts later in news interviews, and Smith wrote about hers in her blog.\n\nSome women journalists reported being assaulted in one-on-one attacks on streets or other public places. About half said they had been sexually harassed in their workplaces by male bosses and co-workers. Few of any of these incidents had been reported – and small wonder because most news organizations around the world still do not have policies against sexual harassment. Neither do companies provide support after their journalists are harassed or attacked.\n\nThe women journalists behind these statistics are the ones who endured to work on. Not all were so lucky.\n\n[*Mindy Ran*](http://www.equaltimes.org/mindy-ran?lang=en), a freelance feminist journalist and co-chair of the Gender Council, International Federation of Journalists, recounts a long list of women who were brutally slain in the line of reporting. Among them were several who reported on Chechnya, including Elina Ersenoeva, and a few months later, Russian investigative reporter Anna Politskovskaya, both in 2006. Somali writer Horriyo Abdulkadir was shot point-blank by gunman in 2011 who left a note saying \"she talked too much.\"\n\nMexico is the most dangerous country in the world to be a journalist today, particularly for women. In 2011, Marcela Yarce Viveros and Rocío González were found naked, bound and gagged and dead after reporting on official corruption. That same year, Mexican newspaper editor Elizabeth Macías Castro was found decapitated by police with a note left by her killers saying she died for writing about criminal activities on social media websites.\n\nThe Communication and Information on Women ([*CIMAC*](http://www.cimacnoticias.com.mx/sites/default/files/informe_impunidadcimac.pdf.)), a Mexican feminist news agency founded in 1989 to provide a gender perspective in journalism, has expanded its activities into advocacy after many of its writers were assaulted or threatened. In 2010, CIMAC increased its investigation and reporting on the murder of hundreds of young women in the north of Mexico since the 1990s, as well as drug trafficking and official corruption.\n\nRetaliatory attacks against female reporters escalated followed, and in 2015, CIMAC undertook [*a study*](http://www.cimacnoticias.com.mx/sites/default/files/informe_impunidadcimac.pdf.) to track violence against both male and female reporters in Mexico. The study documented 13 cases of violence against female reporters in 2010, 39 cases in 2011 and 47 in 2013. While assaults against Mexican male reporters increased 276% in the five years examined, assaults against women increased 2,200%, the report said. Mexican police have repeatedly refused to either investigate or make arrests in these cases, or to protect journalists in their work.\n\nOrganizations are also under threat. CIMAC's headquarters were vandalized in 2008, with most of its computers and archives stolen, after the agency posted stories about the rape of young girls by police and military soldiers. The agency's journalists – like women journalists around the world – are also stalked and threatened online, and harassed in their reporting.\n\nOnly in recent years have any of the journalism watch groups separated data by gender in their monitoring of reporters' safety, and incidents are believed to be greatly underreported. Reporters without Borders, which presently counts women as only 7% of all journalists murdered in the line of work, believes the actual number to be closer to 13%.\n\nMindy Ran and other feminist journalists led the campaign in pressuring the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) and International Labor Organization (ILO) to advocate for passage of [*Resolution 2222*](http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11908.doc.htm) by the UN Security Council in May 2015. That measure condemned attacks against journalists and called on world governments \"to create a safe environment in law and practice for media professionals to do their work\". In addition, these same activist organizations have initiated a movement that resulted in the earlier UN General Assembly's adoption of the an International [*Day to End Impunity*](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/events/prizes-and-celebrations/celebrations/international-days/int-day-to-end-impunity/international-day-to-end-impunity-2014/about-the-international-day-to-end-impunity/) Against Journalists in 2013. That resolution pressures authorities to investigate journalists' murders and bring killers to justice. While not specific to women, these measures will clearly benefit women journalists, alive and deceased.\n\nGroups like Reporters without Borders, Committee to Protect Journalists, and Article 19 have also been more pro-active in addressing the victimization of women reporters. On International Women's Day this year, IFJ called for an end to violence against women journalists.\n\nThe most dangerous work for women journalists is and will undoubtedly remain reporting on men's violence, whether that violence is interpersonal assaults like rape or battering, structural violence like official corruption, or societal violence like war.\n\nNotes:\n\nCarolyn M.

Started by long-time fans Ian Washburn and Josh Silver, RWF thought it was important to stand in solidarity with Native Americans.\n\n\"The name is a dictionary-defined slur. \\[Team owner Daniel Snyder\\] says he means no harm using the name,\" Silver says. \"However, throughout history, minorities have been called slurs and insults in order to justify inferior treatment of them. The team names perpetuates unhealthy stereotypes. The right thing to do is for Mr. Snyder to change the name immediately.\"\n\nRWF's principal activity has been a campaign, begun early this year, to collect petition signatures that will be delivered to team owner Snyder, showing him that there is substantial popular demand among local football fans and the general public for changing the name. Petitions have been circulated outside Metrorail stations, at street fairs and community meetings. The signature total is nearing 1,000 and the group expects to collect many more.\n\nRWF anticipates delivering the first batch of petitions to Mr. Snyder and the team in early December as the season is winding down. RWF will keep collecting signatures and engage in other activities until Snyder does the right thing, Silver says. In response to previous RWF activism, the Arlington County Council passed a resolution asking Snyder to change the name, and Montgomery County will not use the name in official county communication.\n\nRWF is seeking people interested in circulating petitions in their communities or workplaces, at transit hubs or any other place people gather.

Primitive accumulation produced farmers perpetually in debt or losing their farms; rampant use of leased convict labor under a southern judicial conspiracy, and what was emerging as \"wage slavery\" capital accumulation by exploiting wage labor in cities. As Fraser states, *\"*Combined and happening at the same time, the imminent extinction of the family farm and the descent into the dependency of wage slavery in the cities provided the critical mass for the unparalleled explosion of anticapitalist resistance that distinguished the long nineteenth century*.\"*\n\nFraser points out that people steeped in precapitalist ways of life conflated plutocratic capitalists with the old-world aristocrats, and that the prevailing resistance language of violence came from a fear of slavery: *\"*...a society that feels it may be living on the precipice of slavery is a society living on the precipice, on the edge of some final confrontation.*\"* The rebellions that began to erupt, for example the 1877 national railroad workers strike, were treated by officialdom as a crime wave perpetrated by brigades of lawless \"tramps.\" Racial phobias were used to denigrate strikers as \"savages\" and \"squaws,\" while the whole power of the legal system backed by government militias to quell the labor uprisings was commanded by industrial capitalists. Meanwhile, the labor movement itself became fragmented by racial and ethnic hatred and distrust. As Fraser says, *\"*Even while the strikers were displaying extraordinary courage in facing off against United States Steel and the vast infrastructure of power it \\[the corporation\\] could bring to its defense, the strike became a theater of primordial tribalism, proving how impossible it was to separate the labor question from the race question*.\"*\n\nFraser explains that at the end of the long 19th century the reforms of the New Deal brought a \"civilized capitalism.\" This tamed version of capitalism, in conjunction with the rising American standard of living based on the \"progress\" of economic growth, *\"*...became the solvent in which all those immemorial hard-edged social antagonisms of the long nineteenth century would dissolve*.\"* At the same time certain anti-capitalist words, the language of resistance like \"class,\" \"exploitation,\" \"public ownership, or \"socialism,\" were essentially purged from the American vocabulary as dangerous in a process of \"linguistic cleaning.\" Americans lost the very words for resisting.\n\nThe rise of financial capitalism and the proliferation and glorification of mass consumerism heralded the second Gilded Age. This \"flexible capitalism\" began to cannibalize the structures of industrial capitalism throughout America in a process of deindustrialization to provide liquid funds for the magical \"financial engineers\" who could turn money into more money by trading paper assets \"...while passing the intermediary messiness of producing anything.*\"* But as Fraser points out, \"deindustrialization is antiseptic terminology for social devastation*\"* as whole towns and associated jobs, social supports and traditions *\"went down with the smokestacks.\"* What Fraser calls \"flexible labor,\" a euphemism for \"disposable workers,\" became a hallmark of the finance-driven economy, as did the rise of poverty associated with low-wage labor in food-service and retail jobs. Convict labor made a comeback in support of private enterprise.\n\nDuring our second Gilded Age, the \"...fable of the financier especially (as well as the techno-entrepreneur) as freedom fighter has made its unique contribution to that mood of acquiescence..\" as has the fable of the Wall Streeter as \"heroic revolutionary.\" Moneymaking was transformed into \"a fearless quest for self-discovery.\" Fraser calls this transformation, the \"mythos of the plutocrat as rebel.\" And these American rebel plutocrats perfected a populist morph into the faux-Bubba, appealing to Americans as \"a simple country billionaire.\" Americans could participate in the quest for individuality at the mall by consuming gear and products \"...to create a magical realm in which all is harmony, happiness and contentment....\" And if you couldn't afford this quest for individual expression via consumables, then borrowing, assuming debt was the answer. Then, weighted down by debt, addicted to debt, consumer culture undergirds a state of permanent wage labor.\n\nMeanwhile, flexible capitalism has less need for permanent workers, so a new labor category emerged: emancipated labor or the free agent, liberated to \"do his own thing.\" Be your own boss; work at home, leading to longer hours via self-exploitation. Voluntary servitude was replacing wage slavery. As Fraser explains, \"...the outlook of neoliberal flexible capitalism sees the self as the ultimate resource, self-exploitation another name for self-expression, and the more pliable and more malleable, the freer.\" This free agency, \"the individual public offering,\" of talents and capabilities, however, meant the loss of economic security, and health and retirement benefits. Fear and desperation led to anxiety, dread and docility. Outside contractors performed the work previously done inside the company, leading to the lessening of social ties that benefitted unions. Those at the poverty level in this system of economic capitalism put the blame on themselves as free agents who \"made bad choices.\" In a telling linguistic turnaround, the term \"parasite\" in our current Gilded Age is directed at the lowly poor, not the bloated, financial capitalist, supported and bailed out by government welfare.\n\nFinally, as a frightening coda, Fraser sees a pervasive inability for Americans to even imagine a system outside of capitalism. He says, \"...the capacity to envision something generically new...has always supplied the intellectual emotional and political energy that made an advance in civilized life, no matter how truncated, possible.\" And, horrifically, \"To be grown up in the Age of Acquiescence may be a sign of early-onset senescence.\" How do we get out of this mess? Maybe Fraser's next book will help.\n\n*&lt;&gt;Editor's Note: The Metro DC DSA Book Group meets more or less monthly. Fraser's The Age of Acquiescence was the topic at the most recent meeting, and participants agreed it was so substantive it deserved some further discussion at the next get-together.

Due to continuing disagreements over certain trade and intellectual property provisions among the different Pacific Rim nations still negotiating the detailed provisions of the pact, final language for the TPP won't be available for President Obama's signature until this September at the earliest. Under the provisions of a \"fast track\" bill that Obama and congressional Republicans narrowly managed to pass last summer, Obama's signature on a proposed TPP will begin a 30-day period in which members of Congress can view the document, but not members of the American public. Then another 60 days must pass in which the proposed TPP is available for inspection\nby all before Congress can vote on the proposed TPP and Obama can sign\nit into law.\n\nIf the different nations hoping to form the TPP can iron out their disagreements by this month, then, activists within the labor, environmental, consumer rights, health care advocacy and other movements hoping to stop the TPP will need to scramble to mobilize enough popular opposition to it that Congress will vote it down in December. But some anti-TPP activists hope that if the TPP negotiators cannot reach an agreement on the pact's provisions in time, congressional action on the TPP will be put off until next year. Because new \"free trade\" treaties have been highly controversial in the US since the 1993 approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA, it's likely that the supporters of TPP will then seek to avoid making it a potential issue in 2016 election campaigns, which probably would mean that supporters would wait until the lame duck session of Congress in December 2016 to bring it to a vote.\n\nThis at least has been the thinking in two recent anti-TPP conference calls organized by Andrea Miller of People Demanding Action (PDA-Action) with support from MoveOn.org organizers around the country, labor and environmental activists, and the Global Trade Watch program of Public Citizen.\n\nIn an anti-TPP conference call in late August, however, organizers against the TPP said the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, frustrated by the continuing inability of Congress and the White House to push the measure through, may now be pressuring Congress to hold a vote on the TPP by as early as next March. It's likely that this idea will prove unpopular with the pact's supporters in both parties who would rather avoid discussing the pact during an election year, but some TPP opponents do think that an early 2016 vote on the pact is a possibility.\n\nWhat is urgently important for TPP foes to do now, activists on the conference call stated, is to keep up the pressure on Congress and – as Miller said on the call – to \"educate, educate, educate\" voters about the many ways in which the TPP would be detrimental to the public at large, both in the U.S. and in other would-be signatory countries, such as New Zealand, Australia, Japan and Malaysia.\n\nPalpable perils to organized labor, consumers, the natural environment and representative democracy in the signatory nations could flow from the TPP and from a second pro-corporate trade pact that the Obama administration is promoting, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP.

The left-wing Syriza party, elected to govern in early spring, was split severely by the leadership's acceptance of an onerous and humiliating bailout deal with the \"troika\" representing Greece's creditors – the European Central Bank, IMF and European Union. The deal, which had more or less been rejected soundly by Greek voters in a hastily-called referendum, included the privatization of public enterprises, even more grinding austerity for workers and pensioners, tax increases and the insertion of European Union monitors in Greece's national government. It was, Ian Parker said in a *New Yorker* profile of flamboyant Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, \"even more severe and humiliating\" than the one turned down\nby the electorate.\n\nThe reluctant acceptance of what Syriza's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras privately called the \"blackmailing ultimatum\" split Syriza. Tsipras got the package, with Greek concessions, through the Greek Parliament with the help of centrist and right-wing parties but lost a big chunk of his own, which reconstituted itself as an opposition party. Having lost his working majority, Tsipras strategically resigned, bringing in a caretaker government and an election, now set for Sept. 20, that would be the test of whether he could cobble together a majority coalition after having accepted a kind of deal he was elected to contest.\n\nBehind that public, political show was the international financial equivalent of a back-alley beating by bullies. North European members of the Eurozone, led by Germany, were intent on bringing to heel not only debt-burdened southern nations in the Eurozone but any left-wing parties in the common-currency zone that showed fight against the prevailing winds of austerity-as-debt-relief.\n\nJames Galbraith, an economics professor at the University of Texas (Austin) and frequent critic of austerity in the US and elsewhere, knew Varoufakis well as a colleague in the UT economics department. When Varoufakis returned to Greece to join Syriza's move into government, Galbraith was close to the action, going to Greece several times this year as a volunteer consultant. He shows up in Parker's somewhat star-struck *New Yorker* portrait of Varoufakis and collaborated on refined versions of a \"Modest Proposal\" so-called, a counter-austerity plan for a Europe-wide Keynesian redistribution of resources to lift working classes throughout the Eurozone. Not incidentally, this sort of rump version of the Marshall Plan would aid the sovereign finances and lives of people in e.g. Italy, Greece and Spain. The \"troika\" members, unimpressed, were clearly uninterested in any moves that would bolster the fortunes of left-wing parties and movements in Europe. Any success of a left-wing party pushing back against austerity would be a precedent that the North, Germany above all, would not permit.\n\nThis scenario and the politics of the Eurozone were the topic of Galbraith's July 28 talk at the Economic Policy Institute in DC. At that point it was still uncertain whether Greece would defiantly default and be forced to exit the Euro, or be forced to accept the worst that the creditors could offer. Galbraith suggested it was a slow-rolling tragedy that would result in Greece's acceptance of the terms, since most Greeks did not want to exit the Euro.\n\nThe roots of the Greek financial crisis, Galbraith acknowledged, were decades during which Greece was \"misgoverned\" in advance of the first real confrontation with creditors in 2010. The state had \"borrowed recklessly from reckless banks,\" the *New Yorker*'s Parker summarized. To get even difficult terms, the country was forced to promise lower pensions and more neoliberal labor conditions, trying to boost what Galbraith said had been declining productivity coupled with rising wages and bloated public payrolls. The North Eurozone, often scornful of the work ethic of the Mediterranean Eurozone members, were \"using a small country as the arena for radical deregulation of the labor market.\"\n\nThree governments in succession failed to deliver and fell, and each time terms became more onerous. Syriza, which Galbraith described as \"an unusual coalition of left forces of all classes,\" was elected in early 2015 to fight back.\n\nMeanwhile the public officials in the \"troika\" worked after 2010 to shift the debt of Greece and other debtor countries from the reckless banks who had made the loans to the public's pocketbook. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, in 2010 head of the IMF and preparing (pre-scandal) to run for the presidency of France, overrode his staff and bailed out several French banks that were seriously overleveraged in the Greek debt. \"The French behaved deplorably,\" Galbraith declared. Altogether the bailout of Europe's overextended banks amounted to \"the most lending in history.\" Once the \"troika\" officials took over from the banks, they could apply the squeeze directly. \"They only wanted to talk about tightening,\" Galbraith said, instead of being willing to discuss debt relief – actually writing down principal. This despite the fact that IMF staffers stated baldly that under the terms applied, Greece's debt was [*unsustainable and simply could not be paid off.*](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-troika-analysis-says-significant-concessions-still-needed)\n\nAs the crisis intensified in June and July, Varoufakis told Parker, Greece was offered terms that were so unpleasant that it was \"the kind of offer you make when you don't want an agreement.\" In his conversations with the *New Yorker* writer he suggested that the Euro group applied humiliating terms, stalled and starved the Greek economy in order to hurt Syriza's credibility with the Greek people. He [*told*](http://inthesetimes.com/article/18339/the-greek-apocalypse-versailles-or-brest-litovsk) Slavoj Žižek \"the Troika is cleverly forcing upon the government legislation that spreads and entrenches further its own fiefdoms within the state.\" Syriza, he said, to the Euro group is \"a government we don't want\" and their offers were designed to upend the country's politics – again. Varoufakis said to the Euro group negotiators, \"Don't crash us. If you crash us, we'll end up with some very nasty people taking over\" – still a possibility if Tsipras can't gain a coalition opportunity out of the Sept. 20 election.\n\nCertainly the alternative offered in the \"Modest Proposal\" runs counter to austerity and the rescue of banks. The plan, which Galbraith characterized as \"pro-European progressivism,\" pushes the currency union gently toward political union with Europe-wide redistributive actions. Parker paraphrased Varoufakis's opposition to the 2001 adoption of the Euro by Greece: \"If there was going to be a currency union, then it should not be half-baked, and should function more like the one that joins California and Alabama.\"\n\nThe [*Modest Proposal stated*](http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/euro-crisis/modest-proposal/5-the-modest-proposal-four-crises-four-policies/):\n\n\"We propose that four areas of economic activity be europeanised: banks in need of ESM \\[European Stability Mechanism\\] capital injections, sovereign debt management, the recycling of European and global savings into socially productive investment and prompt financing of a basic social emergency programme. ... While broad in scope, the Modest Proposal suggests no new institutions and does not aim at redesigning the Eurozone. It needs no new rules, fiscal compacts, or troikas. It requires no prior agreement to **move in a federal direction** \\[emphasis added\\] while allowing for consent through enhanced cooperation rather than imposition of austerity.\"\n\nGalbraith suggested that the somewhat divided Euro group was following the lead of Germany, portrayed in Greece as the villain of the story. Having been instrumental in the shifting of the Greek debt risk from the banks to the public, Galbraith said, the German officials were just as stuck as their colleagues with the consequences of the austerity program and the unsustainability of the Greek debt. German officials, he said, had to be thinking \"Can you really say to the German taxpayer that we have made loans that can never be repaid? \\[If you do\\] wait until after my career\" is finished.\n\nVaroufakis, a Marxist since his school days in England, told Parker that these events were evidence of structural flaws in capitalism. \"Most of my colleagues in economics think of crises as preventable accidents – a mistake of some policy – whereas, if you look at the world from my perspective, capitalism generates them.\"\n\n[*WE NEED BERNIE: DSAers work the crowds for socialist values*](http://dsadc.org/we-need-bernie-dsaers-work-the-crowds-for-socialist-values/)\n\nTuesday, September 8th, 2015\n\n\n\n[*DSA members canvassed with fliers for the Bernie Sanders campaign at the Takoma Park Farmers Market in August, top.

This frequently has brought the District – with its overwhelmingly Democratic voter base and its majority-minority population – into the crosshairs of Republicans in Congress, who are all too eager to beat up on DC for enacting progressive legislation that the GOP opposes. Instances of congressional meddling in the District are legion, but the most egregious examples include the following:\n\n-   For nearly a decade, Congress prohibited DC from using its own funds to conduct a needle-exchange program to prevent HIV transmission, leading to rates of HIV and AIDS in the District that were the highest in the country. The lifting of the ban in 2007 led to a [*dramatic drop in new HIV infections.*](http://wamu.org/programs/metro_connection/15/09/25/dc_needle_exchange)\n\n-   In 1998, DC approved a voter initiative to allow marijuana to be used for medical purposes, but Congress forbade the District from even counting the vote for a year (it passed with overwhelming voter support) and then blocked DC from implementing medical marijuana for more than a decade.\n\n-   In 2011, to avoid a shutdown of the DC government, Congress – with the assent of President Obama – banned DC from using its own revenues to fund abortions for low-income women.\n\nIn a 1980 referendum, DC voters chose to make the District the 51<sup>st</sup> U.S. state, which would eliminate congressional interference in local matters once and for all. Now, 36 years later, not only has DC not achieved statehood; it has had to continually defend the limited home rule it achieved in 1974. In 1997, Congress even stripped the District government of virtually all its powers, and for several years DC was run\nby a congressionally appointed control board.\n\nThe failure to make DC statehood – and even defense of limited local democracy – a national issue has not been for lack of trying by DC officials, principally nonvoting House Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton as well as the District's elected \"shadow\" senators and representatives (whose job is lobbying Congress for statehood) and citizen organizations such as the Stand Up! for Democracy in DC Coalition, DC Vote and Neighbors United for DC Statehood. Clearly, more work needs to be done to engage DC residents in the statehood movement, to say nothing of the rest of the country,\n\nNevertheless, all of the candidates have weighed in on DC's status at various times, often when asked by local journalists or elected officials. Most of those who have served in either house of Congress have voting records on DC statehood or home-rule matters.\n\nIt will surprise no one that DC would fare much worse under any of the current crop of Republican candidates than with the Democrats. Statehood, especially, is a nonstarter for most Republicans, as this would mean one more certain vote for Democrats in the House and two in the Senate. From time to time, moderate Republicans have been open to measures short of statehood, such as a single vote for DC in the House of Representatives or more local control over the budget. But GOP support for even these limited reforms has been mostly missing lately.\n\nBelieve it or not, the one Republican candidate still in the race who has not completely shut the door on statehood is Donald Trump. In an interview last August on NBC's *Meet the Press*, Trump responded to host Chuck Todd's question about his views on DC statehood by first plugging his new hotel in the former Old Post Office building, and adding:\n\n*I would like to do whatever is good for the District of Columbia because I love the people. You know, it's funny. I've really gotten to know the people, the representatives, and the mayor, and everybody. They're really special people. They're great. And they have a great feeling. So I would say whatever's best for them I'm for. *\n\nThat's more of a non-answer than anything. But compare that to the rest of the surviving Republican field, [*whose attitudes were compiled by DC Vote*](https://www.dcvote.org/blog/where-do-current-presidential-candidates-stand-dc-equality):\n\n-   Ted Cruz – Of all the Republicans in the field, Cruz has been DC's most active antagonist. During the current session of Congress, Cruz has introduced bills to repeal DC laws banning workplace discrimination and protecting the rights of LGBTQ students. He also introduced a measure to force the District to spend locally raised funds to provide vouchers for students to attend private schools.\n\n-   Marco Rubio – Rubio has no qualms about bashing the District to score points with his conservative supporters. Last year he introduced a bill that would have repealed virtually all of DC's restrictions on guns.\n\n-   Ben Carson – After winning a straw poll of DC Republicans last summer, Carson said: \"There are a lot of things that D.C. doesn't have when it comes to infrastructure. For example, D.C. doesn't have an agriculture infrastructure and that could be a real problem when it involves being a state. People who support D.C. statehood need to think long and hard about things like that. Perhapsit would be better if the Districtcould have voting representation inMaryland or Virginia.\" That reflects the views of many DC Republicans; the local party has supported voting representation in Congress but has never fully embraced statehood.\n\n-   John Kasich – While a member of the House, Kasich opposed statehood when it came up for a vote in 1993.\n\nAs for the Democrats, Hillary Clinton has been even more coy about her views on statehood than even Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, both of whom gave ringing rhetorical endorsements to statehood but declined to do anything more to bring it about. While a member of the Senate, she supported an unsuccessful bill to give the District a single vote in the House – a bill many local democracy advocates vehemently opposed, considering it a poor substitute for full statehood. When it comes to making a public statement about statehood she has been silent, although she expressed her support for statehood in a private conversation with Eleanor Holmes Norton, according to a [*Norton press release*](https://norton.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/norton-gets-clinton-s-personal-support-for-dc-statehood). If whispering soothing words in our delegate's ear is as far as she is willing to go, we can guarantee that a Hillary Clinton administration is not going to drive statehood to victory.\n\nThis leaves Bernie Sanders. Of all the candidates he is the only one to have consistently, firmly backed statehood for decades – going back to 1993 when he voted for statehood as a member of the House representing Vermont. In 1993, during the House debate over the statehood bill, [*Sanders made this statement on the House floor*](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4552649/bernie-sanders-dc-statehood):\n\n*How could I in good conscience say that it is appropriate for Vermont to have two seats in the Senate, which is does, to have a Congressman who can vote on all the issues, which we do, to have a governor and a state legislature which deals with all of the problems facing our people, which we do, and then say that the people of the District of Columbia, with a population larger than Vermont and larger than some other states, should not be able to enjoy the same rights?*\n\nSanders' views have not wavered since that time, reflected in his becoming a sponsor of the New Columbia Admissions Act, the statehood bill currently before Congress.\n\nDC Democrats who regard achieving statehood as a top priority will have a clear choice in the June 14 primary. Those who are willing to put DC's fate in the hands of the Democratic hierarchy might be content with Hillary Clinton as the nominee. For those who want our President to be a true champion of statehood, only Sanders fits the bill.","order":0},{"title":"Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association: A Respite Not a Victory","date":"2016-02-29","issue":"March 2016","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"Public sector unions – and the US labor movement as a whole — dodged a bullet when Supreme Court Justice Anthony Scalia died in the midst of hearing Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, for there is little doubt that his vote would have been decisive in breaking a 4-4 tie in the case. A decision, had it been made, would have undercut the ability of public sector unions to collect fees for the workers whom they represent. But unionists should take little comfort from that, for it is only a bit of breathing space – the anti-labor offensive will not go away. Speaking at the February 14 DSA membership meeting, Chris Townsend, Director of Field Operations for the Amalgamated Transit Union (and formerly United Electrical Workers political director), argued that rather than hope for good court rulings, labor needs to aggressively organize its members and act with political independence on behalf of working class interests.\n\n***The Legal Dispute***\n\nAlthough the specific battle in Friedrichs is over, it is important to remember what it is about for the issues at stake will come up again and again. Rebecca Friedrichs, nine other school teachers and the Christian Educators Association claimed that the California Teachers Association violated their First Amendment rights by requiring non-union members to affirmatively opt out of paying the full agency fee for union representation. A description like that, of course, makes the matter seem arcane and too technical to have far-reaching meaning; moreover, it can seem like a legitimate request – after all, why should non-union members have to pay anything to a union? But behind the verbal games is a simple fact: Unions are legally required to represent all workers within a bargaining unit, whether or not they are members. If the California Teachers Association negotiates a pay raise, or an improved pension, or a smaller class size or an extra holiday, Friedrichs would accrue that benefit even though she never joined the union. And if she was unfairly transferred or assigned an extra time slot, or harassed by a principal, she could file a grievance through her shop steward. Moreover, if she felt that the union did not sufficiently fight for her at a hearing, she could sue the union for failing its obligation to provide fair representation – again, even though not a union member (and that is not a hypothetical, it happens – for some individuals hypocrisy will trump solidarity every time).\n\nSuch a restriction is unique to unions; government does not hold any other kind of organization – non-profits, churches, publicly traded businesses – to such a standard (one of many forms of unfair and disparate treatment to which federal law subjects organized labor, as Townsend pointed out). Moreover, the logic of Friedrichs had other implications, for behind it lies an effort to narrow the range of issues public employee unions can address almost to the point of vanishing. Federal workers, as we know in the DC metro area cannot bargain over wages, although they can advocate for members. But such advocacy can be considered \"political,\" as can virtually every measure any federal, state, even municipal public union advances; after all, every such measure impacts on the \"public\" or \"taxpayers\" – and so the effort to undermine union dues collection falls in line with the effort to undercut union bargaining rights, union political activity.\n\n***In the Background***\n\nPublic employee unions are now under attack by corporate interests for the simple reason that they are the strongest section of the labor movement given the success of preceding decades' attacks on private sector unions. The Friedrich's case did not emerge because a few disgruntled teachers decided to go to court. Rather the lawsuit was developed, promoted, bought and paid for by the Center for Individual Rights, a right-wing think tank funded by the Koch Brothers, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the Scaife Foundation and other funds dedicated to the destruction of social rights – thus the CIR has not only targeted unions, it has also fought against voting rights, affirmative action, protections for LGBTQ people, and remedies for violence against women. Townsend noted Jane Mayer's **Dark Money** – a book about the Koch Brothers, their roots in the John Birch society, and their connection with other wealthy industrialists – as providing a glimpse of the forces arrayed against working people. He noted too, that the class dimension of the business struggle against organized labor – of which Friedrichs is only the most recent instance – can be seen in the role of General Electric, a company that has had a representative sit in every White House Administration, Democratic and Republican, since the 1920s.\n\nOne of the myths used to build opposition to unionism is by exaggerating labor's strength, a myth used today in the assault on public employee organization. For they do not have anywhere near the power attributed to them – many states deny them bargaining rights altogether, some of the most egregious instances evident in Virginia. Townsend used that state to make a further point; most unions have become so timid and so bureaucratic they fail to resist such attacks – so unions supported Democrat Terry McAuliffe for Virginia governor without even asking him to consider changing anti-union state laws, laws initially proposed by labor-backed Democratic governor Doug Wilder. That failure to make demands on candidates is currently on display in this year's presidential campaign, many unions have endorsed Hillary Clinton despite her past support for NAFTA and other free trade deals, despite her current refusal to support a $15 minimum wage. More to the point, Townsend stressed, those unions supporting Clinton, have not asked for anything in return. Access is what they want, but access by itself will do nothing to enable unions to organize or to gain the power right-wing opponent claim they have.\n\n***Organizing Resistance***\n\nWhich returned him to his first point; it is an anomaly — and an aspect of the successful effort by property-owners to limit popular democracy with the writing of the Constitution –that Supreme Court justices have so much power. But such power can only be contested by an engaged labor movement that fights back, that continues to organize at workplaces to resist corporate power and to build workers' collective strength. And that same approach, Townsend stressed ought to apply to presidential and congressional elections — which should not be fought over the pick of a judge, but rather ought to be seen as a means of electing people to office who will proactively legislate on behalf of working people. And this is where Bernie Sanders' campaign is so important, for, he explained, Sanders has gone out of his way to support union struggles – a record not sufficiently known in its specifics, but a record important to remember. A Sanders presidency would not be about union presidents having access to the White House; it is about having a committed ally for workers mobilizing and organizing to assert their rights. Labor's gains have only ever come through such action; they have never been gained by passive waiting.\n\n***A Quote***\n\nTownsend referred to lessons of the past contained in some of William Z. Foster's writing. A syndicalist and later Communist trade union leader, he was a successful mass organizer in the meatpacking and steel industries and strategist in labor struggles through the early and mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. In a pamphlet written in 1925, when union strength was at a low point, Foster wrote the following lines that remain relevant today, when union strength is again at a low point:\n\n\"A glaring weakness of conservative trade unionists in attempting to organize the unorganized is their failure to take into consideration this fact, that the mass of workers have organized themselves in order to fight immediately for their demands. The conservatives stress the organizational side too much and the struggle side too little. ... They proceed upon the basis that workers can be brought into the unions slowly, man by man, and then held there indefinitely until the great mass is organized, when sometime in the distant future, perhaps demands will be made on the employers for better conditions. Such a theory is of course absurd. ...\n\n\"The future trade unions of the great unorganized industries will be born in the heat of struggle **... Organization campaigns ... are preparations for strikes.** They are a struggle for position between the employers and workers in the big battle that is soon to come, the strike over establishment of better conditions. It is in this sense that such campaigns must be conceived and carried through\"\n\n**\\[American Trade Unionism: Selected Writings** *by William Z.

The poem is included in an article by Peter Dreier, \"Gloria Steinem Renews an Old Debate About Socialism and Feminism,\" that was posted as a blog in *Dissent* [*https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/gloria-steinem-hillary-clinton-socialism-feminism-history*](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/gloria-steinem-hillary-clinton-socialism-feminism-history)\n\nDreier puts Steinem's criticism of young women supporting Bernie Sanders in an historical context, noting the narrowness that results when economic justice and the rights of women are perceived as separate. Speaking in more direct personal terms of the moment, Holly Wood explains in no uncertain terms why, as a millennial feminist, she has no problem with support Sanders and opposing Clinton ([*http://www.villagevoice.com/news/feeling-the-yern-why-one-millennial-woman-would-rather-go-to-hell-than-vote-for-hillary-8253224*](http://www.villagevoice.com/news/feeling-the-yern-why-one-millennial-woman-would-rather-go-to-hell-than-vote-for-hillary-8253224)). So too, Kate Albright-Hanna discusses her evolution from having been a Clinton intern in 1995, someone who admired Hillary Clinton, into someone who strongly wanted Elizabeth Warren to run this year, and absent that alternative, unreservedly supports Bernie Sanders today. She writes:\n\n\"They say that I'm so blinded by my devotion to economic justice that I'm willing to miss this historic opportunity to lift up my sisters (well, just this one very special sister). To which I say: Patriarchal countries around the world have been passing the baton to the female relatives of male leaders for centuries. It's always been one of the cracks in BroWorld — one that a few lucky women have been able to slip through. But I don't want to just slip through a crack. I want to break BroWorld into a million pieces. That's why this BernieLady is on board for the revolution.\" ([*https://medium.com/@katealbrighthanna/a-bernielady-in-a-broworld-b95d89a6952a\\#.lsguygpmc*](https://medium.com/@katealbrighthanna/a-bernielady-in-a-broworld-b95d89a6952a#.lsguygpmc)).\n\nFeminism and support for economic justice go hand in hand, something Barbara Ehrenreich, who played a key role in DSA's commitment to socialist feminism at its founding in 1982, has always stressed. This comes through in an article which addresses the shortening life span of white working class men today, symptomatic of the economic injustice African-Americans, Latinos, women of color, face in even harsher terms. ([*http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barbara-ehrenreich/middle-class-life-expectancy\\_b\\_8687694.html*](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barbara-ehrenreich/middle-class-life-expectancy_b_8687694.html)). Awareness of the ways race, class, gender impact upon one another – and how theories and politics of liberation need address that interaction is the ground upon which intersectionality emerged. Victor Wallis, an editor of the journal *Socialism & Democracy*, attempts an explanation of the term both historically and theoretically in Intersectionality's Binding Agent: [*http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07393148.2015.1089032*](http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07393148.2015.1089032)\n\n\n\nWithout using the term, Beyonce's \"Formation,\" performed at the Superbowl to commemorate the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of the Black Panther Party, made linkages in struggles for justice, celebrating women's leadership in the struggle for black lives as discussed by Malini Johar Schueller in Counterpunch . ([*http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/02/16/lessons-from-beyonce/*](http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/02/16/lessons-from-beyonce/)). Linkages also made by Angela Davis who explained in an article connecting the struggles of the Black Panther Party in her youth to those of Black Lives Matter explained: \"the feminist notion of intersectionality is one that should be incorporated into our work as well. I like to talk about the intersectionality of struggles, and how important it is to link the struggle against gender violence with the struggle against state violence, police crimes, and crimes against women's bodies.\" ([*http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ebonycom/angela-davis-talks-black\\_b\\_9254196.html*](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ebonycom/angela-davis-talks-black_b_9254196.html)). And, finally, she and her sister Fania Davis (who played a key role in the worldwide \"Free Angela\" campaign in 1970 when false FBI charges threatened the death penalty) gave a joint interview in *Yes Magazine* in which they emphasize that *\"Self-care and healing and attention to the body and the spiritual dimension—all of this is now a part of radical social justice struggles.\"* ([*http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/life-after-oil/the-radical-work-of-healing-fania-and-angela-davis-on-a-new-kind-of-civil-rights-activism-20160218*](http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/life-after-oil/the-radical-work-of-healing-fania-and-angela-davis-on-a-new-kind-of-civil-rights-activism-20160218))\n\nAnd thus we see in these articles – different articles, reflecting different emphasis and points of view — aspects of what was raised in the talk and subsequent discussion. All fuel for further though and action – individual and collective.\n\n**&gt;&gt;Andy Feeney delves into the (somewhat) startling speech on banks too big to fail by Neel Kashkari, former henchman of Tim Geithner and Ken Paulson...** **Bernie's Right About Dismantling Big Banks – According to Bush's 2008 Bank Bailout Czar**\n\nIn 2008, a former Goldman Sachs banker, Neel Kashkari, headed up George W. Bush's emergency program to keep the U.S. financial system from collapsing in response to a fast-moving financial crisis. As Assistant Treasury Secretary with responsibility for the newly created Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), Kashkari oversaw the disbursal of hundreds of billions of dollars in payments to some of the nation's largest financial institutions to keep them afloat during the crisis.\n\nKashkari, a Republican who made an unsuccessful run for Governor of California in 2014, is now President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. And in his new position, he declared in a Feb 16 speech to the Brookings Institution that some U.S. banks have become \"too big to fail\" and that because of this, they pose a continuing threat to the health of the economy.\n\nAlthough the Dodd-Frank Act financial reforms of a few years ago have significantly strengthened the financial viability of such banks, Kashkari told the Brookings audience, there is still a risk that in some future financial downturn, they will again face possible collapse and require a bailout from the taxpayers.\n\nFor these and other reasons, Kashkari has said that Congress should move either to break up these giant institutions into smaller pieces which can be allowed to fail without significant threat to the economy, or convert them into highly regulated public utilities, with little ability to take on major risks, or systematically tax \"leverage\" – the use of borrowed money for speculation and investment purposes – throughout the financial system to reduce the risk of future crises.\n\nIntroducing Kashkari at the Brookings event was David Wessel, a long-time financial reporter and contributing editor to the *Wall Street Journal*, who is currently Director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings.\n\nIn a remark quoted in the *New York Times,* Wessel said in the panel discussion following the speech that he could imagine Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren voicing some of the ideas that Kashkari had expressed, but they weren't what one normally expects from a \"Goldman Sachs Republican.\" Kashkari, the *Times* reported, replied that in his current position, he felt a duty to express his concerns about the banking system, and that if he didn't, he wouldn't be doing his job.\n\nFor a link to Kashkari's speech, you can visit the Minneapolis Fed's web site at [*https://www.minneapolisfed.org/news-and-events/presidents-speeches/lessons-from-the-crisis-ending-too-big-to-fail*](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/news-and-events/presidents-speeches/lessons-from-the-crisis-ending-too-big-to-fail) .\n\nFor the *Times* article on the speech, visit [*http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/business/dealbook/federal-reserves-kashkari-says-banks-still-too-big-to-fail.html?\\_r=0*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/business/dealbook/federal-reserves-kashkari-says-banks-still-too-big-to-fail.html?_r=0) .\n\nFor a Brookings video of the speech, click here: [*http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/brookings-now/posts/2016/02/kashkari-big-banks-still-risk-regulations-not-far-enough*](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/brookings-now/posts/2016/02/kashkari-big-banks-still-risk-regulations-not-far-enough) .\n\n\n\n**&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Basics of Socialism: a list of introductory reads about DSA and socialism**\n\nIt's a PDF, not the most helpful format, but here it is: [*http://www.dsausa.org/introductory\\_reading\\_list*](http://www.dsausa.org/introductory_reading_list)\n\n\n\n**&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Other entries on this month's Good Reads roster:**\n\nJeremy Gilbert has a very stimulating, if traditionally framed, argument in Red Pepper (Brit) on the need for a conscious pro-modernity strategy in advancing socialism.

It is about code. You, know, what coders do. Your correspondent has it on good authority from some academic types that this is actually a good introduction.\n\n[*http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/?cmpid=BBD022416*](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/?cmpid=BBD022416)","order":2},{"title":"History of Socialist Feminism(s) Is Traced in February Salon","date":"2016-02-29","issue":"March 2016","author":"Rose Driscoll","body":"Socialist feminism is a way of thinking that links the gender-based oppression women face with the oppression of a lower class under capitalism. Historically, the owners of the means of production could profit more from women's labor because they were not legally obligated to pay women as much.\n\nIn a discussion led by Dr. Carolyn M. Byerly, nearly thirty members of Metro DC DSA analyzed the state and effect of socialist feminism. Byerly, a longtime DSA member, laid out a thorough history of the feminist movement in the western world and in America in particular, a narrative of manufacture of our own consent, both rewards and punishment.\n\nThe rising garment industry was well-organized and heavily comprised Eastern European immigrants who were familiar with socialism and with ownership that exploited and treated women poorly. Still, when they began to unionize, they lacked focus on women workers. Similarly, Gandhi's movement for liberation in India did not include a reform of the treatment of women, evident in the sexual violence still rampant (though bitterly fought against) in modern India.\n\nThe \"second wave\" of feminism, led largely by liberal feminists, sought largely to gain for women the same opportunities offered to their male counterparts as well as protections against sexual violence, both domestically (i.e. domestic abuse and spousal rape) and at work and in the public sphere (i.e. sexual harassment). The second wave accomplished new rape laws, founded women's shelters, and won rights to abortions and college education.\n\nBut liberal feminists operate under the assumption that equality can be achieved through individual choices and need not rely on a wider sphere in government, society, or through communal work. The leaders of the movement — Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan — had a blind spot around labor in general and family leave in particular. While some socialist feminists worked within the liberal feminist movement, founding communes and collectives, the mainstream actors remained fixated on individualistic feminism within a capitalist framework with an emphasis on personal choice.\n\nAt the DSA salon, this prompted a discussion of whether capitalism is inherently patriarchal — and indeed, whether any advanced society has been able to work beyond patriarchal frameworks. While more egalitarian societies than our own have adopted workable communal ownership or the means of production, none has established a matriarchy, let alone developed the industrialization and technology that we consider necessary based on our own rampant consumerism.\n\nAnd in addition to consumerism, we in modern America place great value in our war machine. The DSA salon had a long discussion on whether the military-industrial complex is attributable solely to the patriarchy. While no doubt men have largely led the war machine, notable exceptions include Secretary of State and presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton. Likewise there is nothing to suggest that masculinity is inherently and unchangeably violent, despite the media's best efforts to convince the public otherwise. Men can indeed overcome the societal expectations to stand on throats — whether physically or financially.\n\nThe oversight is what inspired many groups to splinter off and search for their own feminism. African American feminists, seeking to distance themselves from the liberal (and largely white) feminists, struck out into womanism. This new framework allowed them to consider the intersectionality of race, gender, and class oppression. Angela Davis, working from a Marxist analysis of slavery, led the Communist Party of the USA and worked closely with the Black Panthers to work for Civil Rights and — and to provide meals for neighborhood children before school.\n\nThe main difference between the feminism of Angela Davis or any socialist feminist, and that of Gloria Steinem or any liberal feminist, is in the analysis of the problem. Socialists, feminists or not, frame the problem first in the exclusive ownership of the means of production, whereas liberal feminists see the exclusivity of capitalism's ruling class and the hierarchy it creates, and deem it acceptable — as long as a woman *could be* one of those ruling capitalists, some day.\n\nBut not only is women's liberation is a central plank in any reform of capitalism; women will never be fully liberated within a capitalist structure. Even today, capitalist oppression targets women specifically. Women are often viewed by capitalists as a means to make money rather than respected in terms of their own rights. The prevalence of gendered messaging in beauty, fashion, and diet industries often result in mental health issues and sexual abuse for women and girls. The recording artist Kesha attempted to release herself from a contract with music industry giant Sony after years of abuse and sexual assault at the hands of her producer, but her request was denied on the property-based premise that Sony had paid her contract and owned the rights to any music she might make, thereby forcing her to continue to work with her rapist. And more insidious is the outdated but clinging notion that women cannot both have children and work — men see a 6 percent pay raise if they have a child, [*while a woman's pay decreases 4 percent *](http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/02/political-power-single-women-c-v-r.html)for every child she has.\n\nHow to improve the lives of female workers everywhere? Offer paid family leave and paid sick leave. Women are still relied on to provide the majority of work in the home, whether for care of the house or for a spouse, for children or for sick and elderly relatives. Support healthcare reforms that help women choose the size of their families and make the care for those families affordable. Raise the minimum wage — two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women, and that's just in the US. Feminism is on the rise globally, through education becoming readily available online and increasingly in person. Feminists and socialists alike will need to continue fighting to ensure that quality education is available to women worldwide.\n\nDomestically, feminist socialists will need to bring concerns at the intersection of feminism and the redistribution of wealth — paid family and sick leave and quality sexual health education to our lawmakers. We will need to offer support to women who are deemed less valuable than money — those working for minimum wage, those who are still expected to complete all the unpaid tasks of the homemaker, and those who are forced to endure sexual abuse in order to continue to make the money they need to survive. We will need to highlight these concerns in discussion with liberal feminists in order to bring awareness to the problems of capitalist ideologies.\n\n*Metro DC DSA holds a Socialist Salon – generally, a meal and discussion – on the third Thursday of each month.

Yet plant closures and lost strikes always leave in their wake suicides, marriage breakups, drug and alcohol abuse, spikes in petty crime and violence, all predictable consequences of loss. And not just material loss, but loss of a sense of purpose or control that comes with a demonstration of powerlessness. Anyone who has witnessed up close or experienced the devastation of lockouts, lengthy strikes, plant closings, long-term unemployment will know the devastating truths revealed in Lynn Nottage's ***Sweat*** staged this season at the Arena Theatre.\n\nThe play focuses on the lives of three women workers (Tracey, Cynthia, Jessie) at a steel mill who survive through thick and thin, taking strength in the work they do, the mutual support they can give each other – mutual support that helps mitigate the harsh world of labor, of personal disappointments or family troubles, because of the community they form and share. But that mutuality, that sharing, that solidarity is made possible because a stable job and a strong union gives them a sense of security around which they can try and build a build a life. And so their friendships cannot survive the destruction of job, union strength or community.\n\nTheir stories – and that of the other characters in ***Sweat*** — are based on conversations Nottage had in Reading, Pennsylvania – once a thriving industrial center, today the poorest city in the United States; a multi-racial, multi-ethnic poverty. In her words: \"Reading has been through an incredibly hard time. There was a level in some rooms of desperation, of profound sadness. In some rooms you could feel the nostalgia for what was and the longing for that to return. I think in some cases, there was genuine confusion: like, we signed with a contract with America, these were the things we were supposed to receive, and somehow we were lied to. So I think that people felt betrayed.\"\n\nBetrayed is another term for loss, a theme addressed by two of the most beautifully written monologues in the play. Jessie recalls a moment, just out of high school, when she and her then boyfriend thought that they would pursue the hippie dream, and travel through Asia (the 1960s an era when countries of the far and middle east felt like havens from materialism, rather than centers of \"terrorism\") the names of the cities never visited repeated like an incantation. Instead, marriage, family, factory work took up her life; with the husband leaving her for a younger women only adding insult to injury in thought of the road not traveled. While in a reminiscence that is an attempt at an explanation of herself, Tracey tells of being taken around the city by her grandfather, a stone mason whose work was etched in buildings around the city, a piece of Tracy in each, at a time when craft and labor were visibly respected – a story told when the buildings themselves no longer stand. Both are white, and they speak precisely to what Nottage saw and heard, people in disbelief about the promise of our country, the social contract working people struggled for so painfully, being broken so thoroughly as if it had never existed at all.\n\nFor Cynthia, an African-American woman, those illusions did not exist; a racist society always means living on the edge. Still she had lived progress in the move from South to North, lived progress in steady employment, decent wages, union organization, that made possible a different kind of life with different kinds of possibilities. Her estranged husband, a once proud man who stood strong when challenged by management, became lost as the lockout at his plant took away his pride, his lack of work took away his self-respect, his drug habit takes away the pain of looking at what he doesn't have. Recalling these brief instances from the play however, misrepresents a bit the depth of Nottage's characterizations – each is three-dimensional, filled with depth and nuance. And thoughts of the past do not suggest a romantic nostalgia; life was always hard and filled with challenges, even a strong union didn't make a life of factory work easy; physical pain from a life of labor is never distant for any of them. And the pleasure all take in drinking at the bar in which the play is set itself reflects a desperation even in moments of pleasure they do manage to create. But that recent past allowed a sense of place from which to resist – as an individual, as part of something larger – and to build; and the ability to resist and renew is precisely what winds up being taken away.\n\nAnd the portrait of the complexity of each individual is why the play as a whole is so compelling, for it never takes the easy way out. Midway through, Cynthia is promoted into management, an advance especially meaningful to someone who had to face racism in every step on a journey to build a life that is more than drudgery, an advance that leads her to a conflict in loyalties, an advance that doesn't protect her when the factory itself is closed. Yet it is a brief moment of progress that comes with a different kind of hurt, for the undercurrent of jealousy it creates with Tracey also brings to the surface traces of a racism in Tracey that otherwise wouldn't have come to the fore – and yet doesn't deny the fact of how real, how deep and meaningful their mutual friendship had been.\n\nA friendship that had been passed on to their two sons, themselves factory workers (though Cynthia's son once aimed toward college), embittered and lost to themselves and each other by strike-connected violence that leads them both to prison; the forces destroying the community robbing them of their future. A future never even open to Oscar, the Dominican who can only get work cleaning up at the bar, unseen as a person by black or white – unable to ever get work at the factory until the lockout lands him a temporary job as a scab. Implied throughout is that the evils to be uprooted are not the choices made in desperation or anger, but rather the path of society that create such unpalatable choices. This is voiced by Stan, the bartender an almost constant presence in the play. A Vietnam veteran, a former factory worker until injury made him \"unfit\" – he speaks throughout as one who tries to create a sense of mutual understanding amongst warring friends, to give a sense of the past receding in memory, articulating what amounts to a progressive, class-conscious point of view. Not that the character as written would use such words himself, rather such a description comes from noting his ability to see the whole of what is happening rather than the part. Stan's fate – devastating to see on stage – then becomes a metaphor of the working-class voice being taken from them.\n\nNottage's other plays – all with strong African-American and African themes – touch on the politics of daily life in ways both tragic (***Ruined***; ***Intimate Apparel***) and comedic (***By the Way Meet Vera Stark***) that bring to life social realities by a focus on the mundane and the personal – exploring social conflict through the relationship of individuals. It carries on a tradition one can find in the works of Eugene O'Neil, Susan Glaspell, Lillian Hellman, Arthur Miller (Nottage recently edited and introduced a new anthology of his works), Lorraine Hansberry, Ntozake Shange, or August Wilson by developing a radical politics which is not explicitly such, which does not directly speak about \"current events\" or particular historical leaders. Rather a picture is painted of the whole through the interaction of one to another that is critical and challenging of conventional wisdom and comfortable certainties , following a path perhaps best seen in Sean O'Casey's plays. So the politics are there in its indirection – just as the centerpiece of the play is the life of these three women, yet it begins with the two young men talking to their parole officer after release from prison, and ends with them back at the (now gentrified) bar in a return to the scene that brought them to jail.\n\nThe year of that beginning and end is 2008, a year of massive plant closings, and the rest of the play is set in 2000, the year of NAFTA; a purposeful connection made by Nottage, although neither NAFTA nor bank failures are ever mentioned in ***Sweat***. Ever in the background, they are the impersonal forces that impact on people for whom politics is usually assumed to be for other people. Purposeful too is its opening last year, its staging in DC at the Arena in the midst of the presidential elections, for Nottage recognizes that something must be done, the people need to pay attention and to act. ***Sweat*** certainly paints a grim picture, and there is little glimmer of hope for anyone at its close. But that does not make it a despairing work. We get a glimpse of who these people were, what they had been and built – and what was once built can be rebuilt.\n\nReading was once not only a center of union strength, it was one of the last industrial strongholds of the Socialist Party – the city elected and re-elected a socialist Mayor in the 1930s. Gone by the 1950s, it was still a solid Democratic, New Deal oriented, industrial town. Then came changes people didn't understand, the loss of broader social solidarity that left unions isolated – and left unions with the illusion that they could survive in their isolation. The Reagan years destroyed that illusion and showed the corrosive impact of the loss of solidarity which rolled over our country in waves that always seem to hit people unaware. But those who created the destruction were aware, manufacturing towns and industrial unions were not undermined by some mysterious process, they were destroyed systemically by rapacious corporate owners in a system that defines value solely by increasing profits. And so pride in work for its own sake, dignity and community as values of greater import than the quick buck, worker organization to secure and protect such values – are threats to be tolerated by corporate powers when necessary, and crushed whenever possible\n\nIncreasing numbers of people are now aware of that broader reality. We see it all around us, not least in the public response to Sanders's presidential campaign. It is to that search for understanding that ***Sweat*** – like many other recent works of theatre – speaks. Speaking to inform or encourage action based on awareness and togetherness; the combination that enables hope to emerge. An encouraging sign of such a combination was the large number of seats reserved by the Metro Labor Council at the Arena on January 27, expanding thereby the number of union members who could see and reflect upon the play.\n\nNottage puts this in notes that appeared in the Playbill describing what led her to write ***Sweat*** after reading an email she received from a close friend: \" 'She said that she was completely broke; she was having a very difficult time making ends meet and had reached a level of desperation.' Her friend wasn't asking for a handout, but said she wanted her close friends to understand her circumstances. ... 'I'd known this woman extremely well, and I had no idea the depths of her despair. She lives two doors down from me, and it made me realize that probably most of us are living two to three doors away from someone who is either in poverty or on the verge of poverty, and that's the nature of the culture we're living in right now.'\n\n\"The Occupy Wall Street movement was just beginning. 'We had no sense of what this was. All we knew was that there were these people in Zuccotti Park sitting there and saying, 99 percent of us are suffering while 1 percent are continuing to get richer and richer.' The two walked in circles and chanted. Later, her friend said, 'I actually feel a little better. Nothing has happened, but I feel better to know that at least there is a voice to what I'm feeling and I'm not by myself.'\"","order":4},{"title":"Maryland's Paid Sick Leave Bill — Hitting the Committee Wall Again?","date":"2016-02-29","issue":"March 2016","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"Maryland's progress in supporting struggling families has been significant in recent years – raising the minimum wage toward $15 and hour by stages, for instance.\n\nBut there are several pieces to supporting those struggles that remain to be put in place, and one of the biggest is on legislators' plates – again – this week.\n\nPaid sick leave, which is up for consideration for the fourth straight year, is a critical element in family stability and the chance for people to get traction and improve their lives. As before, it is in danger of committee burial, as Del. David Moon explicitly warned at the Progressive Neighbors forum in Silver Spring Feb. 28. Hearings before those critical House and Senate committees are coming up this week, March 1 and 3 (details below, including a way for Maryland residents to express support to legislators). DSA nationally and the Metro DC DSA local have supported the paid sick leave effort as a critical component of a broad move toward better public provision at every level of government, including in the District where some progress has been made.\n\nMaryland Del. Luke Clippinger of Baltimore [*recently capsulized the needs*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-sick-leave-20160218-story.html) in *The Sun*: \"For the more than 700,000 Marylanders who are unable to earn paid sick days, abiding by a doctor's orders to stay home and rest can mean forgoing groceries or rent. The choice is even more heart-wrenching for working parents who must decide between sending a sick child to school or day care, versus staying home and missing out on necessary income.\"\n\nClippinger is lead sponsor of [*HB0580*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?pid=billpage&tab=subject3&id=hb0580&stab=01&ys=2016RS), which allows workers at many levels to earn paid sick days as they work.\n\nFurther, Clippinger notes, \"Nationally, four in 10 private sector employees are unable to earn paid sick days, and the bottom quarter of earners suffer the most: 75 percent of them don't get paid sick leave. Our most vulnerable workers in Maryland and beyond who are often already living paycheck to paycheck stand the greatest risk of losing their jobs simply because they fall ill.\n\n\"Not surprisingly, workers without access to paid sick days are more likely to go to work sick and more likely to delay needed medical care, leading to prolonged illness and costly emergency room visits. When food service workers go to work sick, they put Maryland's public health at risk\"\n\nProgressive Maryland, a pro-worker grassroots group mainly active in Montgomery and Prince George's counties, is part of the [*Working Matters*](https://mdpaidsickdays.wordpress.com/) coalition advocating for this effort, which stalled in critical committees for the past three years largely due to complaints from business interests that it will hurt the economy. As Clippinger detailed in his op-ed, \"these concerns are not borne out by the facts.

Presently, they must use vacation days for sick leave, and after several \"sick days off,\" they are dismissed.\n\nMetro Access is the service that provides transportation for persons with disabilities on an appointment basis in the greater DC area. The meeting was called by Amalgamated Transit Union local 1764, the union representing Metro Access employees and negotiating with WMATA for a new contract.\n\nRiders and workers alike are struggling under what they claim are unfair conditions in the recently privatized system. The parent agency, the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority (WMATA), has has outsourced this critical service for disabled persons throughout the metro-wide service area.. One speaker said the van she drove was owned by a company in France.\n\nAdvocates for riders also seek stronger action by the Metro board to remedy bad equipment and regulatory constraints. One man spoke from his wheel chair about Access vans arriving to pick him up but having lifts that didn't work or that couldn't accommodate the weight of him and his wheelchair. A woman said she rode in a van one day whose door wouldn't close.\n\n\n\n*Photo: Carolyn Byerly*\n\nPrince George's Executive Rushern Baker was in attendance but arrived late, catching heat from activists who said that lateness or absenteeism can cost them their jobs.\n\nBaker, whose family life is widely known to be affected by his wife's Alzheimer's disease, described how waiting for caregivers sometimes disrupts his schedule and causes him to be delayed. The tough audience palpably softened as he spoke.\n\nBut Baker was not off the hook as county exec – he had been challenged before he came through the door by Kimberly Lynch, a paratransit driver who said somberly that drivers were trying to serve their disabled customers within a broken system, beset by private companies that skimp on support and cheat the paratransit users.\n\nIn 2013 Metro [*announced award of five contracts*](http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=5447) totaling $86 million a year for five years for MetroAccess, including three transit operators who would get $68 million to transport disabled persons. The three transit operators – Veolia (now operating as TransDev), Diamond and First Transit – continue to provide what is widely considered substandard service. Metro touted the arrangement as promoting accountability but MetroAccess driver Lynch argued that \"safety, professionalism and respect\" are out of reach as drivers \"do the best we can within a broken system\" and that WMATA officials \"treat us like disposable people\" and \"are more interested in passing the buck than in providing solutions.\"\n\nCase, who is accessibility and safety coordinator of the Metro Rider's Union, said of the drivers and dispatchers, \"they're just as stuck in the system as the rest of us.\"\n\nNumerous disabled clients of MetroAccess testified about their dissatisfaction with the service and with the treatment of the drivers, who they said were abused by the rules imposed by the private companies. Valencia Moody, an officer of a Prince George's chapter of the National Federation of the Blind, said WMATA board members needed to be reminded that their job is \"service to us, not service to you.\"\n\nAnd driver Eric Williams said that even though Baker represented only one of the numerous jurisdictions that funded Metro, he had the power of the purse and of appointments to the WMATA board and should be held accountable for using them. The disjointed power structure of WMATA, he said, was \"no excuse for inaction\" and the driver/rider coalition had to pressure the other jurisdictions as well.\n\nThe goals for the event were read from the podium and executive Baker was catechized on them, asked to affirm he would push the Maryland members of the WMATA board to establish a $15 minimum wage and paid sick leave for the drivers, who must give up vacation time if they are sick or caring for sick children. He was pushed, as well, to support paid sick leave legislation in Prince George's County (where it had already failed with no visible support from Baker) and at the state level (where a bill is pending – see related story).\n\nAnd he was urged to push for improvements in MetroAccess specifically –\n\n-   Ending a requirement for fare collection outside the vehicle regardless of weather or other hazards\n\n-   Ensuring that all van lifts work with actual weight on them, rather than empty-lift testing\n\n-   Improving the inadequate Call Center geotracking system, which falls well short of GPS capability\n\n-   Review the scheduling software, which often sets wasteful routes and unnecessary travel duration for disabled customers\n\n-   Improved sensitivity training on disability that includes input from disabled customers.\n\nBaker's answers were generally \"yes\" to the demands though he qualified his \"yes\" with needs for study and review in some instances. ATU field organizer David Heller, asked which of the demands would require most follow-up and watchdogging in Baker's case, grinned \"All of them.\"\n\n*Carolyn Byerly contributed to this article.*","order":6},{"title":"\"PLEASE TELL OUR STORY SIMPLY TO THOSE WE WILL NOT SEE...\"","date":"2016-02-29","issue":"March 2016","author":"Lynne Williamson","body":"Review of *The Left Side of History: World War II and the Unfulfilled Promise of Communism in Eastern Europe*, by Kristen Ghodsee\n\nKristen Ghodseeinterweaves the personal actions and fates of the Lagadinovs, a Bulgarian communist partisan family, and Major Frank Thompson, a young British officer sent to provide support to the partisans in the efforts against fascism in Bulgaria. This interweaving serves as the structure for the history of the promise and the failure of communism in World War II and after in Bulgaria.\n\nThe word \"Left\" in the title resonates in two ways. First, \"Left,\" of course, stands for the political designation for the communism of the Bulgarian partisans and their young, doomed British supporter, Frank Thompson. But the word \"Left\" also reinforces the ultimate \"left behind, left out, abandoned\" historical outcome of the efforts of Thompson and the Lagadinovs, when the positive hopes for a better future through communism are horribly eclipsed by the post-war brutalities of Stalin. This sense of promise lost and the sacrifices of people forgotten is reinforced throughout the book by the author's elegiac tone and by brief, pertinent quotes from Thompson's war poetry as well as intimate dialogue with survivors of pre-and-post World War II Bulgaria. As Ghodsee says, \"I wanted to recognize the nuances of what communism meant to ordinary people, how it motivated or paralyzed them, how it fueled hope or spread despair. There is the official history of communism and there is the intimate history of communism—the latter composed of individual men and women making individual decisions in a confused and sometimes chaotic world.\" Frank Thompson died before the triumphant surviving Bulgarian communist partisans descended from the mountains and into the villages and towns as war heroes when the Red Army crossed into Bulgaria in September 1944. Elena Lagadinov, who had at age 11 had smuggled messages and supplies to her communist partisan brothers because \"communism meant dolls and books for all children,\" was among the survivors. In fact, she survived the partisan period, the Stalinist aftermath and the subsequent era after 1989 called not what the West calls the democratic revolution, but simply \"The Changes.\" Elena's intensely moving conversations with the author and those of some of her friends about their hopes during the communist period, particularly the women's efforts to make life better for women and families, make up a critical part of the left out, left behind, abandoned history that Ghodsee captures for us. The author clearly knows that given the current blackwashed word \"communism,\" equating to \"Stalinism,\" she risks being labeled as \"an apologist for totalitarianism\" as she documents the progress of women in Bulgaria between 1944 and 1989 through their stories.\n\nFor example, Elena Lagadinov describes for the author how during the communist period she developed a comprehensive plan to give women paid maternity leave and to build more kindergartens, a plan that she gave to party officials in a three-hour presentation in an effort to socialize housework in order to incorporate women into society. Elena explains about the idea of justice that motivated her: \"It was about building a society that would work for the many rather than enriching the few. And now after \"The Changes,\" Elena says, \"...you see what we have? So many people are without medicine. So many children are on the street; they are not going to school. Prostitutes make more money than doctors and judges. The young people leave to the West and never come back. People are poorer now than they were before the war, while the rich live in mansions with swimming pools in Boyana and Dragalevtsi.\" Elena's friend Anelia says, \"Communism was like Cassandra...It told the truth. But it couldn't change the future because no one believed it.\"\n\nThe author ends the book by poignantly reinforcing the sense of historical change and loss as she describes her trip to all that is left of the once-proud monument to Frank Thompson and the partisans who fought to defeat fascism in World War II and to bring the hopes of communism to Bulgaria. The monument site is described as \"deserted and falling into ruin\" with the marble tombstone cracked and crooked. Frank Thompson's name is listed with other partisans along with the inscription *\"PLEASE TELL OUR STORY SIMPLY TO THOSE WE WILL NOT SEE, TELL THOSE WHO SHALL REPLACE US— WE FOUGHT COURAGEOUSLY.\"* This broken-down, abandoned monument is contrasted with the bright, new monument erected in 1999 celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the collapse of Bulgarian communism. Ghodsee leaves the reader with a deepened understanding of the dilemma that led her to write the book: \"If all acts of heroism are ultimately weighed and judged by subsequent generations of historians ... with their own political agendas, why be brave? Why take a stand? How can you ever be sure that you are fighting for the right thing?\" In this sense, the book serves as Ghodsee's stand.","order":7},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—March 2016 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"March 2016","order":-1,"date":"2016-03-02","body":"**Welcome to the March 2016 issue of the *Washington Socialist*, the free monthly email newsletter of the Metro DC local of Democratic Socialists of America.**\n\nBlack History Month was a day longer than usual, leap year etc., but there was more to it than that.\n\nPerhaps it's in part due to the election year, but Black History Month did not seem like a bell rung in an empty warehouse this year... huge levels of discussion on racism and its attributes had been going on for many months and Black History Month seemed... well, gee... normal.

Before his death several years ago, former Mayor Marion Barry praised the proposed redevelopment as essential to the economic revitalization of this part of Southeast Washington, and an early *City Paper* article on the plan suggested that at first glance, its potential effects seemed to be positive.\n\nIn order to build the new 442,000-square-foot complex, though, City Partners and Sanford Capital are planning to demolish four existing rent-controlled apartment buildings housing low-income and mostly elderly tenants. Under DC's Tenants Option to Purchase Act (TOPA), the tenants, upon official notice of the demolitions, would have a legal right to offer to purchase their units as an alternative to being evicted.\n\nTo prevent them from doing so, tenants and low-income housing advocates say, Sanford Capital has sought to push people into moving out, both by offering them financial assistance in relocating and by allowing the buildings to deteriorate to the point where the tenants face virtually unbearable conditions.\n\nCity inspectors and tenants have discovered furnaces and air conditioners that don't work; leaking plumbing; infestations of mice, rats and bedbugs in some of the buildings; broken doors and broken locks that have enabled squatters and drug users to invade the buildings; falling ceilings in some units; peeling paint; and accumulations of sewage in some of the basements so that buildings are pervaded by disgusting odors.\n\nPerhaps in response to these tactics, a majority of the 47 apartments in the four buildings are now vacant, but a stubborn 19 tenants remain and have formed an Alabama Ave./13<sup>th</sup> Street Tenants Coalition to fight Sanford Capital for their right to exercise their TOPA rights to purchase if and when the buildings are redeveloped.\n\nAttorney Will Merrifield of the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless has represented the tenants in their fight; also taking up their cause is local community activist Eugene Puryear, whom Metro DC DSA endorsed in 2014 in his campaign as the Statehood Green Party nominee for an at-large seat on the D.C. Council. Through a new organization called Justice First, Puryear has organized protests at the homes of developer Geoff Griffis and at the home of one of the principals of Sanford Capital.\n\nAlso taking up the cause of the tenants are D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson and D.C. Councilmember Anita Bonds, chair of the Council's Committee on Housing and Community Development, who on Feb. 4 held a joint hearing of Bonds' committee and the Committee of the Whole to hear testimony about conditions at the Congress Heights properties.\n\nAlso in February, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine sued several individuals and entities associated with the properties in Superior Court, citing Sanford Capital's repeated violations of city housing and health regulations at the property and requesting that the court appoint a receiver to take over the properties temporarily and correct the violations at Sanford's expense.\n\nAlso voicing support for the tenants and demanding correction of the housing violations is Councilmember Elissa Silverman, who attended the Feb. 4 hearing along with Ward 8 Councilmember LaRuby May, who represents Congress Heights. Among other things, Councilmember May declared at the hearing that the D.C. Council would never permit white residents of the District to spend years enduring the same conditions that low-income black residents have had to experience at Congress Heights.\n\nHowever, *Washington Post* reporter Abigail Hauslohner has reported that two close allies of Mayor Bowser who have been involved in a fifth property important to the proposed redevelopment project, Southeast businessman Phinis Jones and his business partner Monica Ray, have political ties to Councilmember May. In the view of some Congress Heights residents and some observers of the controversy, these ties make May's true position on the redevelopment plan somewhat ambiguous.\n\nThe fifth property mentioned, at 3200 13<sup>th</sup> Street SE, is currently under the effective control of the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), since its previous owner essentially defaulted on a $900,000 loan from the city and owes large sums in back taxes as well.\n\nIf DHCD chooses to forgive the unpaid loan and back taxes, the *Post* reports, the property will come under the control of an organization essentially controlled by Jones and Ray, the Congress Heights Community Training and Development Corporation. In that case, low-income housing advocates believe Jones and Ray would help the proposed upscale redevelopment go forward.\n\nIf DHCD chooses not to forgive the loan, however, it could take ownership of the property itself and then use its leverage to pressure Griffis and Sanford Capital into reshaping their proposed development to make it more amenable to the existing tenants. Mayor Bowser's office presumably can have a great influence on which course DHCD will pursue.\n\nHowever, Bowser's campaign for mayor in 2014 received campaign donations of roughly $3,000 from Griffis and his family as well as $3,700 from Patrick Strauss, a principal of Sanford Capital, and his family. Critics of the mayor suggest that this may bias her in favor of the development, which in any case fits in with her larger plans for the redevelopment of Southeast D.C., including the old St. Elizabeth's Hospital campus not far from Congress Heights.\n\nThe Post also notes that in 2015, the mayor appointed Griffis, who calls himself an old family friend, to a position on the National Capital Planning Commission. Whether Ms. Bowser is now likely to direct the DHCD to impose new conditions on the Congress Heights development therefore appears questionable.\n\nNevertheless, Will Merrifield of the Washington Clinic for the Homeless, in an interview with the *Washington Socialist*, said that one thing progressives in the region can do to help the embattled Congress Heights tenants is to contact Mayor Bowser's office and urge her to have DHCD support their cause.\n\n\"A simple thing people could do is to call the mayor's office and tell her to stand with the tenants of Congress Heights and partner with them once they get their TOPA notices, to create affordable housing on top of the Congress Heights Metro,\" Merrifield said. \"I don't think it's ever bad for the mayor to hear from the community and to know that people are concerned about this. I think all pressure is good pressure.\"\n\nIn addition, Merrifield noted, the attorney general's lawsuit against Sanford Capital and its associated entities requesting that its properties be put in receivership is another source of pressure on the developers. A third source of pressure is the campaign Puryear has been organizing through Justice First.\n\nYet a fourth source of pressure is a lawsuit that the tenants have filed against Sanford Capital in the city's Office of Administrative Hearings asking for a rent rollback for tenants who've had to live in Sanford's neglected buildings and endure the conditions there. On that lawsuit, Merrifield said, he is serving as co-counsel along with pro bono lawyers from Arnold & Porter, one of Washington's more powerful corporate law firms.\n\nWhat Merrifield suggests that the District Government should support, as an alternative to the virtual giveaways of valuable land to private developers who build expensive housing and upscale business developments on it, is a commitment to helping low-income tenants to own and control their own housing through housing cooperatives, with the city perhaps establishing an Office of Cooperatives to help people to create and operate such cooperatives well.\n\nAt the least, Merrifield said in the interview, \"The city needs to make available land for true affordable housing development and make a commitment to developing such affordable housing, rather than just giving away land to giant redevelopment projects like the Wharf, which distort land values around them and in this way destabilize entire communities.\" The District Government has plenty of money in its budget to house people, Merrifield added, and can easily find tens of millions of dollars to invest in sports stadiums. \"To me, it's just a matter of will.\"\n\n*Washington Socialist* readers who wish to contact Mayor Bowser can do so by calling her office at 202-727-2643.

I knew virtually nothing about Gray when I campaigned for him, I confess. But as a DSA member I heeded the advice of local labor activists who were furious with then-Mayor Fenty, whose administration had badly undercut the Washington teachers' union and imposed huge losses on local cab drivers.\n\nAt the behest of a long-time labor activist on the local DSA Steering Committee, several members of the Metro DC chapter volunteered to support Gray as Fenty's leading challenger. And for my personal stint going door to door, the Gray campaign people gave me a handsome white shirt with bright blue lettering, proclaiming their candidate's superior\n\nCHARACTER\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nLEADERSHIP.\n\nI haven't worn the shirt in public much since the Sulaimon Brown controversy of early 2011, actually, but now I face a small personal quandary.\n\nFollowing Mayor Gray's Sept. 12 veto of the Large Retailer Accountability Act (LRAA) passed by a majority of the DC Council, and backed by such groups as the Central Labor Council, DC Jobs with Justice (JwJ) and the community and labor coalition RESPECT DC, what should I do with this used garment advertising a used-up politician?\n\nAt least from the perspective of labor activists and RESPECT DC organizers, Vincent Gray as mayor has abandoned all pretenses he may once have had to showing \"Character, Integrity, and Leadership.\" At least to outward appearances, Gray has shafted many of his best labor supporters from 2010 for the benefit of the world's largest corporation, Wal-Mart, which numerous critics have accused of discriminating against women, paying poverty-level wages in other U.S. communities and underwriting brutal sweatshop conditions at its suppliers' factories in China.\n\nIf Gray has such \"character\" and \"leadership\" that he's willing to betray the hopes of D.C. labor activists at the behest of a company like Wal-Mart Stores, what other political atrocities is he also capable of?\n\nUnder the LRAA as supporters proposed it, and as a majority of the DC Council approved it in a courageous vote taken in July, large retailers enjoying sales revenues of $1 billion annually or more, and operating stores in the District with at least 75,000 square feet of retail space, would have been required by 2017 to pay their employees a \"living wage\" of at least $12.50 per hour in combined wages and benefits.\n\n\\[[*See Mike DeBonis, The Washington Post*](http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-12/local/41988960_1_wage-proposal-living-wage-living-wage),\\]\n\nThe LRAA would have included a potential exemption for large retailers who engage in collective bargaining with their workers – an important selling point for organized labor, and one that might have enabled some of Wal-Mart's box competitors, such as Target and Home Depot, some wiggle room from having to meet the $12.50 wage requirement immediately.\n\nBut Wal-Mart Stores is notorious nationwide for fighting against unionization, and this alone made its pursuit of collective bargaining as an alternative to paying a living wage unlikely, to say the least. Nor was Wal-Mart management interested in raising the average wages of associates it planned to hire in the District, although rival retail giant COSTCO reportedly pays its workers an average wage of some $21 an hour – far more than what the LRAA demanded.\n\nIn an [*op-ed published by the *Washington Post**](http://news.walmart.com/executive-viewpoints/the-dc-council-has-forced-our-hand) shortly before the Council vote, Wal-Mart U.S. official Alex Barron wrote that the LRAA would \"would clearly inject unforeseen costs into the equation\" of whether the company would choose to enter the highly lucrative DC retail market. In fact Wal-Mart threatened to cancel plans for construction that it had yet to begin on three of the District stores it had previously planned to open, while possibly pulling out of three other sites where construction has already begun.\n\nA majority of the Council led by Chairman Phil Mendelsohn passed the LRAA anyway, momentarily putting Washington DC in the national headlines for its courage in standing up to one of the world's most notorious corporate bullies. But Wal-Mart's threat clearly resonated with Gray, and on Thursday, Sept. 12, he announced his veto of the LRAA, writing to Mendelsohn that \"If I were to sign this bill into law, it would do nothing but hinder our ability to create jobs, drive away retailers, and set us back on the path to prosperity for all.\"\n\nPresumably the Council might have taken more time to decide on whether to overturn the mayor's veto, but it chose to consider an override decision at its next scheduled meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 17. Frantic LRAA supporters worked over the intervening five days to persuade former \"no\" voters on the Council to change their positions in order to have a 9-vote majority to override Gray.\n\nBut despite a vigorous e-mail and call-in campaign and a Sept. 17 rally outside the Wilson Building, LRAA backers lost the override veto, and Wal-Mart won a significant victory with possibly national implications — thanks in large part to Gray's actions.\n\nAt the Sept. 17 rally, activists from several labor, religious and community groups supporting the LRAA proclaimed that even a defeat on the measure would be a larger political victory for living wage legislation in the District.\n\nBecause of public support for the LRAA and widespread controversy over Gray's veto, they argued, Gray himself is now promising to propose some kind of living wage legislation, as are some Council members who killed the LRAA out of either fear or love for Wal-Mart. Without the LRAA fight, the activists said, many of these same politicians would have done nothing on living wage legislation at all; now advocates for low-wage retail workers at least have a hope of getting a real bill enacted.\n\nYet regardless of how the future fight for local living wage legislation unfolds, many of Gray's labor allies from 2010 are undoubtedly going to think of him henceforth as a Benedict Arnold – as a tired, scandal-tinged politician who out of weakness, cynicism or corruption, or possibly all three, has chosen to betray low-wage retail workers in the nation's capital for the enhanced profits of the largest private corporation in the world.\n\nGray himself has reportedly floated the idea of retiring from politics in the wake of the LRAA controversy, and some Washington observers say his political career is effectively finished.\n\nFor *Washington Socialist* readers, however, how much shock and surprise should we feel when Vincent Gray – or for that matter, any Washington mayor – abandons the public trust when threatened by the world's largest retail corporation?\n\nGiving continued high unemployment in the US, given the fact that African American unemployment overall is now running at 13 percent, while the jobless rate for young black people between the ages of 18 and 20 is an estimated 41 percent, how much choice did Mayor Gray really feel that he had when the world's biggest corporation threatened to pull out of several major construction projects in this city, thus eliminating a number of construction industry jobs?\n\nSince Wal-Mart, like Ayn Rand's fictional hero John Galt and his corporate followers in *Atlas Shrugged*, really does have a great deal of power to drive local and even national unemployment higher through investment decisions about where to build stores and where to close them, how much freedom would even a DC mayor with real \"integrity\" and \"leadership\" have to defy Wal-Mart's demands?\n\nDecades ago, in books like *Socialism* and *The Twilight of Capitalism*, democratic socialist Michael Harrington, one of the intellectual founders of DSA, concluded that even powerful socialist leaders can face nearly tragic dilemmas when they win high government office in a vigorously capitalist society.\n\nWhen a politically successful progressive party – like Britain's Labour Party before the Tony Blair years, for example – wins governmental power in a society where much of industry is nationalized, Harrington noted, the progressive party may well find that it has to run that industry in a \"capitalist\" manner, and impose austerity on the workers nearly as harsh as that prevailing in the private sector.\n\nBut if a strongly progressive or even socialist party takes governmental power in a capitalist country where most production and distribution is still in private hands, Harrington concluded that it's likely to face an even grimmer choice. Either the socialist governing party will need to placate the biggest capitalist investors in the society, for fear of their sabotaging the economy through an investment strike or production slowdown, or it must run the risk of the capitalists triggering a recession to punish it for standing by its principles.\n\nIn either case, whether the socialist government knuckles under to capitalist demands or resists them, it is all too likely to end up betraying its own working-class supporters. Harrington thought this potentially tragic choice was likely to plague even smart, courageous and principled progressives in high office.\n\nWhether Mayor Gray is especially smart, courageous or principled, of course, is a question that angry local activists may answer in the negative. But Harrington's analysis suggests that even if Gray were a reincarnation of Eugene V. Debs, Dr. King, and Karl Marx combined, it is questionable how likely he'd be win any major or lasting victory in a bare-knuckles contest against the moneyed power of Wal-Mart.\n\n\n\nIf Harrington's logic and our own recent experience with DC and national politics both suggest that even a strong and principled leader is likely to lose against Wal-Mart – as I think may be the case – this should not necessarily deter local labor activists from electorally punishing Gray and those DC Council members who voted against the LRAA.\n\nA betrayal of labor is a betrayal of labor, even when the Benedict Arnold who joins the enemy has done so under fire, and any one-time labor ally who turns on his supporters once can probably be counted on to do so again.\n\nBut regardless of Mayor Gray's role in the LRAA's defeat, regardless of whether he turned tail out of corruption or simply out of weakness, the Sept. 12 veto and the Sept. 17 failure to overturn it should lead everyone in Washington to question whether the continued existence of giant companies like Wal-Mart is compatible with the existence of political democracy – either here, or across the United States.\n\nGiven Wal-Mart's victory in the LRAA fight, it is arguable that supporters of democracy should not simply hope for this giant company to be unionized, possibly through magical means, in future years – although that's undoubtedly desirable. Nor should Americans who believe in democracy merely hope for Wal-Mart to be regulated better by the government, or for Wal-Mart's environmental practices to improve – although these things are clearly important, too.\n\nWhat seems obvious from the political experience in the District and around the US as a whole is that for political democracy to flourish in our society, giant capitalist corporations like Wal-Mart need to be dismantled – to disappear, to die as private storehouses of massed investment capital. At a minimum, companies like Wal-Mart, if they are not broken up into smaller pieces, need to be nationalized and operated as public utilities, for only then will their destructive power over elected governments everywhere be effectively curbed.\n\nThis is an unacceptably \"radical\" conclusion to draw in US politics today, of course. It probably does not enjoy universal support even within DSA, and there is no practical way to act on it in the short term. But it's difficult to draw any other logical conclusion in the District of Columbia, where one ethically compromised mayor seems to succeed another, without local voters ever seeing political relief, and where even a law supported by a majority of District residents and passed by a majority on the Council can be overturned easily by the lobbying power and economic threats of the biggest corporation in the world.\n\nSo long as corporations like Wal-Mart can effectively veto the will of a majority of elected officials in this city, formal political democracy in the District is nearly worthless, and the city's residents need to deal with that fact. How we eventually choose to respond is unclear, but when Wal-Mart shows that it can make a mockery of local elected government, we owe this great company the courtesy of learning the lesson it's teaching.","order":0},{"title":"GOOD READS for October: selected articles and links in a radical vein","date":"2013-09-30","issue":"October 2013","author":"","body":"Via Andy Feeney, from Carl Davidson's CCDS blog, a link to a complete movie:\" 'Debtocracy' seeks the causes of the debt crisis across Europe and proposes solutions, hidden by the government and the dominant media.

And that is exactly how conservatives want it.\n\nThe standoff is less between differing Republican vs. Democratic philosophies of governance than between those who want government to work vs. those – nearly all right-wing Republicans – who want it to fail. After the GOP was unsuccessful in its attempt to unseat Obama and recapture the Senate in 2012, the Tea Party Republicans who have come to dictate the party's direction in the House of Representatives have determined to use their leverage to tear the government apart, brick by brick if necessary. They perceive the GOP's gain of a handful of House seats in the last election as a mandate – notwithstanding that voters nationwide actually supported Democrats for the House by a margin of 1.4 million votes; the Republicans' small gain was strictly due to districts that were gerrymandered by GOP-controlled state legislatures.\n\nSimply put, many Republicans don't want government to work, or at least work for most people. The more \"responsible\" Republicans – realists like House Speaker John Boehner or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie – do want government to work, if mostly for the wealthy and large corporations, and they have no problem with government when it comes to military spending and the rest of the national-security apparatus. They also have been willing to cut deals with Democrats, understanding that politics is, as the saying goes, the art of the possible.\n\nOn the other hand, the far-right fringe is determined to undercut the very notion of government in order to achieve its long-term objective of savaging social spending and cutting taxes for the wealthy. Its initial target is Obamacare, and has made defunding of the Obama administration's signature domestic achievement the price for both keeping the government running after October 1 and extending the debt ceiling. As flawed as Obamacare is, its passage served as a statement that the government should be responsible for ensuring that Americans have access to health care (although the program fell well short of true universal coverage).\n\nLikewise, the sequester gutted a wide range of government programs, from Head Start to food programs for the poor, from unemployment benefits to mass transit. The strategy is clear: The far right wants to destroy any idea that government can or will help Americans of modest means. They hope this will cause millions of likely Democratic voters to become alienated from politics and stop voting. Better still, the right might convince more working-class white voters – the \"Reagan Democrats\" of the 1980s – to support the conservatives' homophobic, sexist, racist and religiously intolerant social agenda. As Thomas Frank pointed out in *What's the Matter with Kansas*, once these voters become convinced the government won't or can't help them with their economic troubles, they base their allegiance on social issues – which favors the Republicans.\n\nHowever, a shutdown can be risky politics. The last time Republicans engineered a politically motivated government shutdown was 1995, under then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The scheme failed to help Republicans at the polls, with Bill Clinton convincingly winning re-election the following year and the congressional elections resulting in no net gains for either side.\n\nWhat can Socialists do about this? Except as a part of broader coalitions, we're not going to affect what Congress does over the next month. We can and should continue to educate the public about the need for a vigorous public sector and the potential for the government – combined with an engaged, expanded electorate – to not only provide a safety net for the least fortunate, but to be an active instrument in reducing inequality, generating opportunity, and fulfilling the Declaration of Independence's promise of \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"","order":2},{"title":"Short takes: Navy Yard, Fossil Fuel Wars, Snowden Affair","date":"2013-09-30","issue":"October 2013","author":"","body":"*A NOTE ON THE NAVY YARD SHOOTINGS*\n\nLess than a year after Newtown, yet another mass killing fills the headlines – this one in our own backyard. But unlike Newtown, there is hardly even a pretense among elected officials that they intend to do anything to prevent future massacres. The gun lobby is too powerful – not only the National Rifle Association but also the gun manufacturers who drown with cash any meaningful effort at reform.\n\nAlready, opponents of gun control arguing that controlling assault weapons – the lethal force used at Newtown – would have been useless in this case, since the Navy Yard killer's principal weapon was a shotgun. But this bolsters the argument that banning specific weapons is only part of the solution to gun violence. As [*DSA's Bill Boteler*](http://dsadc.org/prospects-for-reducing-mass-killings/) wrote following the Newtown shootings, greater access to mental health care is an important part of preventing future tragedies. Closing the gun-show loophole is another part of the puzzle. But needed most of all is a turning away from the coarser side of American culture that celebrates violence and fetishizes individualism. As socialists, one of our goals should be creating a culture of community, one that brings people together in mutual support rather than driving them apart into lonely and possibly destructive isolation.\n\n**— Bill Mosley**\n\n\n\n*A REVIEW OF A REVIEW: FOSSIL FUEL WARS*\n\nFor a green/socialist overview of recent climate change news and climate change activism, DSA members may be interested in \"The Fossil Fuels War,\" a survey of developments in the fossil fuel arena by socialist environmentalist John Bellamy Foster. In the September 2013 *Monthly Review*, Foster notes that mainstream energy analysts as recently as 2010 were worrying about \"peak oil\" and a looming crisis of declining production in the fossil fuel industry – a development that seemed to threaten capitalism with future energy shortages, but one that also promised to accelerate a global transition from fossil fuel use to more sustainable energy sources.\n\nIn a remarkably short time, though, fears about \"peak oil\" have been eclipsed by the rapid progress of technological developments facilitating the exploitation of \"unconventional\" fossil fuel sources, which together promise to extend the carbon fuel era long beyond the era of expected shortages once predicted by peak oil theorists. The new unconventional fossil fuels include Canadian tar sands from Alberta, liquid petroleum and natural gas reserves located deep beneath the ocean floor – the search for which occasioned the Deepwater Horizon oil well disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 – and deep reserves of shale gas and \"tight oil\" that are currently being extracted through fracking in many parts of the United States.\n\nThe discovery of unconventional fossil fuels and capitalism's development of new technologies for tapping them are \"unexpectedly catapulting the United States once again into the position of a major fossil fuel power,\" Foster notes in \"The Fossil Fuels War.\" Unfortunately, the same trends have \"catastrophic\" implications for the climate.\n\nClimate change researchers and activists including Bill McKibben of the organization 350.org warn that the vast majority of unconventional fossil fuels need to remain in the ground to prevent continuing climate change that could soon prove \"irreversible.\" Given continued CO2 emissions and the changes in temperature expected from them, the activists warm, the continued melting of summer sea ice in the Arctic, by increasing the amount of solar energy absorbed by the oceans, and the continued melting of permafrost regions in Canada and Siberia, by releasing large volumes of the potent greenhouse gas methane into the air, may together push the climate past a \"tipping point\" where future human efforts to reverse or slow the process will become futile.\n\nMcKibben and many of the world's leading climate scientists contend that the long-term atmospheric concentration of CO2 needs to be less than 350 parts per million (ppm) for the tipping point to be avoided. At present, though, the average CO2 concentration is roughly 392 ppm. And in the view of McKibben and many other observers, the continuing development of unconventional petroleum, natural gas and shale oil reserves that capitalist governments and corporations are hoping to profit from would make it impossible to bring CO2 concentrations down rapidly enough to prevent a \"runaway\" greenhouse effect with dire consequences for civilization.\n\nThe fight to block the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline to make dirty, CO2-intensive tar sands oil from Alberta more available to world markets is one key activist campaign that Foster mentions in his *Monthly Review* survey of this issue. Others that 350.org is promoting include organizing to push local governments , large universities and even banks to divest themselves from stock ownership in fossil fuel producers. But as a somewhat unconventional socialist, Foster argues that such \"supply side\" activist campaigns – although important – will not be enough.\n\nInstead, he cites respected experts with the British Royal Academy and the Tyndall Institute for Climate Research to the effect that \"demand side\" efforts at energy conservation also are required – measures that probably are incompatible with the continued existence of growth-based capitalism. Foster also expresses a long-term concern of many leftwing climate activists about the need for western societies to address the climate issue through a fundamental change in social relations — not merely through rapid development of solar and wind power technologies at the urging of a technocratic green elite.\n\nFor more details, see Foster's [*somewhat lengthy review*](http://monthlyreview.org/2013/09/01/fossil-fuels-war) in the September 2013 *Monthly Review.*\n\n**— Andy Feeney**\n\nSNOWDEN & US\n\nWhen Edward Snowden's revelations were published, many of us thought the kinds of government surveillance they uncovered had been known a decade ago (as described in Wired). At that time we thought that al-Qaeda was a real danger and if a lack of privacy helped keep us safe so much the better. Besides, what was there to hide?\n\nHowever, the political environment changed with the ending of the war in Iraq, the killing of Osama bin Laden, the Arab spring, and the winding down of the war in Afghanistan. Yet the U.S. government programs did not change, nor did Congress see that the new situation required a change in the public social contract. The government prosecuted its efforts with the same vigor it prosecuted World War II and the Cold War. Although this vigor is celebrated with the likes of Seal Team 6, it seemed dubious with whistleblowers like PFC Manning and Edward Snowden. Promising not to execute Snowden if he returns to the U.S. does not suggest an understanding of his needed contribution.\n\nSnowden's and Congress's new disclosures have changed the game. The National Security Agency has most likely spent tens of billions of dollars creating a world-class data warehouse to find only 54 instances where this data helped detect terrorist attempts. Of these attempts, only 13 were in the U.S. and only one was a \"critical\" assist. To spend so many billions to block one terrorist attempt is a waste, or at least blindness to alternative strategies. So what is going on? This question has been what Edward Snowden is all about. His actions have initiated a policy review that is very necessary and one the executive and legislative branches have failed to provide to the American people. To treat such a person as a spy only points out that the system is badly broken and lacks imagination to see alternative techniques and an understanding of our constitutional rights.\n\nAlso unnerving is that the FISA cyber court reviewing the NSA's information requests was appointed by our Chief Justice, whose major contribution has been changing our political contract from one person, one vote to one where corporations are voters and the rich and corporations run the show. The US's political and economic system is badly corrupted by undue monetary influence. Do we want to grant this corruption access to all our personal information?\n\nEdward Snowden has started a badly needed policy review which Congress is joining and releasing new information. Let us make sure the investigation of domestic spying is complete so we understand our options.\n\n\n\n**— Daniel Adkins**","order":3},{"title":"Virginia State Elections for 2013: Extremely Modest Hopes","date":"2013-09-30","issue":"October 2013","author":"Daniel Adkins","body":"Virginia conservatives have bolstered their influence by having state elections in years where there are no federal elections. The 2011 off-year election vote was only 36 percent of the 2012 national election turnout. Conservatives are more likely to vote in those years than others, possibly because urban and suburban areas have more mobility and voter turnover.\n\nAlso, Republican gerrymandering has made Virginia elections more challenging to Democrats. Republicans benefit by Democrats' being concentrated in cities, but gerrymandering in the House of Delegates aided Republicans, helping them achieve a 65-32 supermajority.\n\nIn the House of Delegates, Republicans do not even tell the Democrats where their committee meetings are. One northern Virginian delegate told another, more southern delegate that his school district had students speaking a hundred different languages. The more southern delegate responded, \"How could that be, there are only 20 languages in the world.\" The diversity that northern Virginians take for granted does not impact many parts of the state.\n\nThe Virginia Senate is currently divided 20 – 20, but the lieutenant governor breaks the tie, giving the Republicans the edge. The Tea Party takeover of the Virginia Republican Party was aided by having a convention instead of a primary. The Democrats' long-term hope would be for the exurbs to go Democratic by 2020 when the next redistricting occurs. Turning Virginia blue is a slow process.\n\nRecently, Republicans have passed laws dismantling many abortion clinics and achieving other Tea Party goals.

A claim to fame is wrestling an alligator to secure a $15,000 campaign contribution. He is also a businessman who tried to locate an electric car factory in Mississippi, I guess for the educational excellence.\n\nThe Democrats' candidate for lieutenant governor is Ralph Northam, who is the only MD in the Virginia Senate. He is famous for pointing out the Republican's bill to monitor women's reproductive health by trans-vaginal probes. Unfavorable publicity cut short parts of the bill. Dr. Northam is opposed by one of the most extreme of right-wing politicians, E.W.

The House looks adamant, or comatose.

Whether the shutdown of the US government takes place on its latest schedule or no, our psychic environment quivers with the allabout of government and its attendant politics.\n\nThe present writer very recently rode an Amtrak train (both ways) through what is often and rudely called \"flyover country.\" Many people in Ohio, Indiana , Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona also depend on some attention from the federal government, and many could clearly use more. It is clear that those folks do not spend as much time obsessing about the latest news, and keep their heads down and shoulders hunched for the worst when the narcissists of every stripe posture their way through the routines of misgovernance here in the capital.\n\nEvery town or small city passed by the train showed the signs of decline– some cities holding on to a local industry and looking less distressed while others had clearly lost theirs and showed signs of giving up.\n\nAt the apogee of our trip, Grand Canyon National Park – hosting five million visitors annually – was preparing to close to the public, and employees (one a family member) are preparing resignedly for furlough. We may have been among the last people to enjoy the park and its stupendous views for some time if the non-adult behavior that horrifies us back in the capital persists.\n\nA stayover in Kansas City, Mo. showed a lovely mini-metropolis, once the queen of the frontier, trying to hang on to some industrial remnants that allow a decent living. But areas like what the city calls \"Jazz Hill,\" industrial and largely African-American, are treading water only. The city's well-managed Main Street Express bus, with 10-minute headways all day, showcases excellent parks and museums but Jazz Hill is a food desert served only by an Aldi's.\n\nThe tragedy of the shutdown – and it will be a tragedy – will be muted in parts of the desert Southwest where scattered ranches show one brick rambler with attendant shed-like residences, or on Jazz Hill in KC where many adult men are already unemployed. This new tragedy has to compete with so many existing ones. The nation's most vulnerable places and people have already been abandoned for years by their federal government and leaders; the shutdown in the distant capital will only be a faint echo.\n\nIN THIS ISSUE: Bill Mosley outlines how the triple threat of sequester, shutdown and debt ceiling debacle is not only hurting people immediately but works to destroy trust in government more generally – the core purpose of what often seems like random behavior by the Right.

The Statehood Green, Republican and Libertarian mayoral races have one candidate each – respectively, Faith (the bugle-blowing D.C. statehood advocate and frequent candidate), James M. Caviness and Bruce Majors.\n\nPrior to Gray's announcement there was speculation, and in some quarters hope, that Gray would seek retirement rather than a second term. Certainly his first term has been a disappointment not only to progressives but to a large swath of D.C. voters who placed their hope in him. During his 2010 race he garnered support from much of the D.C. progressive community, including most of the District's unions and Metro-DC DSA. Support for Gray was heavily driven by the contrast he posed to his opponent, incumbent mayor Adrian Fenty. While Fenty was hard-charging, opinionated and insular, Gray projected openness and collegiality. Fenty's four years in office were dominated by his takeover of DC schools from the elected school board and his installation of the abrasive Michelle Rhee as school chancellor. Rhee ran roughshod not only over the local teacher's union but school administrators and parents' organizations as well. While some admired Fenty's take-charge attitude, over time he created more enemies than allies.\n\nYet Gray had barely taken office when the bad news began to accumulate. First came the revelation that his campaign had paid Sulaimon Brown, a vociferously anti-Fenty fringe candidate, to stay in the race and nip at Fenty's heels. After the election, the Gray administration rewarded Brown with a high-paying government job from which he was soon fired after news media began questioning the appointment. Then came the more serious revelation: Local businessman Jeffrey Thompson had allegedly run a giant, off-the-books \"shadow\" campaign that pumped some $650,000 in unreported cash into Gray's mayoral bid. Several campaign officials have pled guilty to criminal offenses, and Gray, who denies any knowledge of the secret campaign, remains under investigation by the U.S. attorney.\n\nMeanwhile, those who hoped Gray would reverse Fenty's school takeover, or at least modify it to give parents a greater voice, were disappointed: He replaced Rhee with the more people-oriented Kaya Henderson, who continued Rhee's policies, only with a smile.\n\nBut for many of Gray's one-time supporters, the final straw was his veto of a bill would have provided a $12.50 per hour minimum wage for employees of big-box stores, $4.25 above the normal D.C. minimum. There was no question the bill was aimed at Walmart, and for good reason: The giant retailer's affinity for busting unions is matched only by its eagerness to cut costs, with much of its stock manufactured in Asian sweatshops by workers earning starvation wages. Since the minimum-wage bill died, Walmart has opened two stored in the District, with more on the drawing boards.\n\nIf there has been a bright spot for progressives during the Gray administration, it has been his effort to raise the profile of the D.C. statehood effort, featuring his arrest in 2011 during a pro-statehood rally and his defiance of Congress by keeping D.C. government offices open during last fall's federal shutdown. Unfortunately, this is far outweighed by his other mistakes and betrayals.\n\nThe Democratic mayoral field began to swell before Gray stepped into the ring, with many of the contenders hoping he would stay out. Of the four councilmembers running, both Muriel Bowser and Tommy Wells voted against the higher wage for big-box workers – a litmus test for progressives if there ever was one. Bowser's vote is not a shock, as she entered office as a Fenty protégé and has little allegiance to labor or other progressives. Wells' opposition to the bill was another matter; he has spent his time in office cultivating a progressive image, although his focus has largely been on promoting public transit and smart growth.\n\nPerhaps as puzzling as Wells' opposition to the bill was the yes vote of Jack Evans, trying a second time for the mayor's seat. Evans has spent his two decades on the Council as the best friend of developers and other wealthy interests. Speculation is that Evans was trying to carve out space in a Gray-less race to differentiate himself from Wells and Bowser, and believed his corporate benefactors would forgive his straying from the fold this one time.\n\nCouncilmember Vincent Orange was a late entry into the field and appears to be making a play for the votes of progressives for whom the other major candidates are tainted. He was a champion of the retailer minimum-wage bill and a vocal supporter of raising the D.C. minimum wage to $11.50, a measure that was approved by D.C. Council in December. Yet Orange is a late arrival to progressive politics; his political history has generally been one of opportunism. However, he appears to recognize the political vacuum on the left and be moving to fill it.\n\nAmong the rest of the Democratic field, Reta Jo Lewis, a former State Department official, stands out for running an aggressive campaign, but her literature mostly offers the uncontroversial mix of better jobs, schools and public safety without real specifics. And then there is Andy Shallal, owner of the Busboys and Poets restaurant-bookstore chain, who is running as a forthright progressive.\n\nShallal's literature emphasizes attacking poverty and homelessness, promoting equality and ending racial disparities in law enforcement – issues on which the other candidates are largely silent. And his restaurants have hosted numerous events appealing to a left-progressive crowd. As a political neophyte, Shallal's challenge will be to convince likely supporters that he is a serious candidate – one with a strategy for marshaling enough support to win, or at least to be enough of a threat to force the leading candidates to address issues they might otherwise ignore. He also will need to make a compelling case that, should he win, he could overcome his lack of experience to effectively control the machinery of government and work with the D.C. Council.\n\nGray, despite all of his problems, enters the race as frontrunner. It requires only a plurality of the vote to win the nomination and advance to the general election. Gray retains a core of supporters, and in a crowded field he could easily split the anti-incumbent vote and cruise to victory, unless a candidate emerges from the field as the go-to challenger.\n\nIn the unbroken string of Democratic mayoral victories in the general election, only rarely has a non-Democrat come close (Republican Carol Schwartz's 42 percent against Marion Barry in 1994, four years after Barry's conviction for cocaine possession, marked the only time a non-Democrat reached 30 percent). But a lot could happen between April 1 and the November 4 general election – such as more indictments from the U.S. attorney, perhaps of Gray himself. In that case, there is a candidate waiting in the wings to pick up the pieces – councilmember David Catania, a Republican-turned-independent who is exploring a possible candidacy. As an independent, he would skip the primary round and run only in the general election. Catania is no progressive; he was comfortable with Republican economic policies but, as the Council's first openly gay member, ditched the party over its hostility to LGBT rights. A crippled Gray could be vulnerable against Catania, who is a strong campaigner with a forceful personality.\n\nThe 2014 D.C. election will revolve not only around the standard issues of economics, schools and public safety, but also along the fault lines of race, age and the clashing priorities of newer vs. longer-term residents. Many longer-time residents, who tend to be African American, are concerned about being crowded out by gentrification and the rapid influx of new, mostly white residents – many of them members of the millennial generation who are-well educated, professional and lifestyle-oriented. In addition, with three councilmembers having been convicted of crimes over the past two years, and a mayor currently under criminal investigation, ethics will be on the minds of voters as never before. This is not the most promising backdrop for progressive politics, but it's the hand we've been dealt.","order":0},{"title":"Good Reads and Short Takes for January 2014","date":"2014-01-03","issue":"January 2014","author":"","body":"***Illuminating text from some undergroundish – and abovegroundish – sources...***\n\n**Corey Robin in Jacobin** fingers one of the agonizing and entrapping features of capitalism... the complexity that consumes all your time.

After failing last year, a minimum wage bill is given a good chance this year and may have the backing of Gov. Martin O'Malley as a booster.\n\nThe counties, and the District, set a four-year escalation of the wage floor from the current federal level of $7.25 an hour – which applies in Maryland – to $11.50 an hour by 2017.\n\nA flurry of similar actions around the country means that \"this year's developments provide a higher floor for wages next year \\[2014\\] in at least 21 states, a record number,\" [*writes Don Lee in the *LA Times.**](http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-minimum-wage-20131209,0,7295277.story?page=1#axzz2nx3lq19s)\n\nLee reported Dec. 8 that The Labor Department estimated 3.55 million workers were at or below the minimum wage last year, out of more than 75 million who are paid on an hourly basis and about 128 million workers overall.\n\nThe two Maryland counties' action was intended in part to boost the chances of success for a statewide minimum wage package.\n\nBut progressives and unions suspect a devious scheme in the business-besotted Democratic core of the legislative leadership. Jos Williams, president of the Metropolitan Washington Council AFL-CIO, has suggested that power brokers in the legislature are planning to use the upcoming struggle over a statewide minimum wage to quash the independent actions of the two counties. Williams [*told the Gazette weekly newspaper *](http://www.gazette.net/article/20131213/NEWS/131219459/0/gazette&template=gazette) of rumors of \"a 'compromise' to raising the statewide minimum wage \\[that\\] would revoke the higher wages passed recently in Montgomery and Prince George's counties in exchange for a higher statewide wage.\"\n\nThe *Baltimore Sun* [*agrees that skulduggery is afoot,*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-wage-20131219,0,6081138.story) and knows who's behind it. In an editorial Dec. 19, the *Sun* said \"Meanwhile, the biggest obstacle to right-sizing Maryland's minimum wage is a Democrat, specifically [Senate](http://www.baltimoresun.com/topic/politics/government/u.s.-senate-ORGOV0000134.topic) President [Thomas V. Mike Miller](http://www.baltimoresun.com/topic/politics/government/thomas-v.-mike-miller-PEPLT004538.topic). While advocates are pushing for a minimum wage raised to $8.20 per hour next year, $9.15 an hour in 2015 and $10.10 in 2016 and tied to inflation thereafter, Senator Miller said recently he'd like it raised to $8.25 an hour and then leave it to individual jurisdictions to decide if they want it any higher than that.\n\n\"He's right that local governments should be able to raise it higher (Montgomery and Prince George's counties have already taken that action) but wrong to set the standard so low,\" *The Sun* concluded.\n\nGino Renne, first vice president of the AFL-CIO Metropolitan Washington Council, said the session will flush out those behind the alleged compromise.\n\n\"And rest assured that we will go after them,\" he said.\n\n[*RaiseMD*](http://raisemd.org/why/), a task force on the minimum wage project backed by the state's unions, says \"raising the minimum wage to $10 per hour will ...directly and indirectly boost pay for over half a million low-wage workers. ... Approximately 350,000 Maryland children have at least one parent who would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage.\"\n\nAt the federal level, the minimum wage of $7.25 per hour has lost so much ground to inflation that it would take the \"Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013, a bill introduced by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) that would raise the federal minimum wage in three incremental increases of $0.95 from its current level of $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour\" to catch up, according to [*analysis by the Economic Policy Institute*](http://www.epi.org/publication/raising-federal-minimum-wage-to-1010/) and many other sources.\n\nEPI's David Cooper noted in the Dec. 19<sup>th</sup> article that the $10.10 level would \"either directly or indirectly raise the wages of 27.8 million workers, who would receive about $35 billion in additional wages over the phase-in period.\" Over half those affected workers work full-time. The resulting GDP boost would bring 85,000 new net jobs.\n\nFourteen states will see an automatic increase in the minimum wage Jan. 1, 2014, either because of new laws or because existing minimum wages are linked to the Consumer Price Index, [*according to a summary by the legal website Mondaq. *](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/282070/employee+rights+labour+relations/Fourteen+States+To+Hike+Minimum+Wage+On+January+1+2014) Most such automatic raises are on the order of 10 to 20 cents per hour. They include such unlikely places as Florida and Arizona, where the CPI will push the minimum to $7.90 (AZ) and $7.93 (FL). Tipped wage minimums will also rise in those two states. Colorado, Ohio, Missouri and Vermont will raise both minimum wage and tipped wage floors, again tracking CPI. New York and New Jersey came late to the party, passing laws raising the minimum wage in 2013 but leaving tipped wages at their current levels, which in New Jersey is an abysmal $2.13. California, Montana and Washington require the full minimum wage for tipped workers; California's goes up to $9 and Washington's to $9.32.\n\n**Sick leave bill has influential booster**\n\nIn Maryland's 2013 legislative session a well-supported and thorough bill that would have provided earned sick leave to 700,000 workers who otherwise face bad choices [*failed*](http://dsadc.org/paid-sick-leave-meets-a-legislative-roadblock/).\n\nIt ran afoul of several money committees well known as the graveyard of progressive legislation: the Senate Finance Committee and the House of Delegates Economic Matters Committee. So for another year, the uncovered workers – 54 percent of them women – continued to have to choose between going to work sick and forgoing a day's pay; staying home to care for a sick child unpaid or take the child to day care instead, with the high risk of infecting other children.\n\nThe crunch , of course, is worst for the state's low-wage workers, 80 percent of whom have no paid sick leave. For them, a missed day's pay can be the difference between making rent or not, paying routine bills or letting them slide into ruinous arrears.\n\nThe measure will clearly be fought over again this year, and has an influential booster in Del. Jolene Ivey, a Prince George's legislator who leads her county's big House delegation and is also a candidate for lieutenant governor as ticketmate of gubernatorial candidate Douglas Gansler.\n\nIvey's announcement in a *Baltimore Sun* op-ed Dec. 9 that she would again sign onto this year's Earned Safe and Sick Leave Act and \"fight for its passage in the year ahead\" gives the measure some impetus. Last year's lead sponsor, Del. Thomas Olzsewski of Baltimore County, said in late spring that he would submit it again with tweaks to answer the objections of the business-friendly members of the Economic Matters Committee.\n\nThe bill, as last year, will allow workers to earn an hour of sick leave for every 30 hours of work, up to seven days, with carryover provisions from one year to the next.\n\nThere's no apparent number for the bill yet – prefile reports on the legislative website are not updated – but Prince George's Del. Jolene Ivey assured a crowd at a Dec. 7 SCLC panel on the 2014 session that the minimum wage struggle and the parallel one over earned sick leave would not cancel each other out. Del. Aisha Braveboy of Prince George's expressed the same hopes outside the meeting.\n\nSen. Paul Pinsky, another Prince George's legislator with a progressive record, has been quoted as saying (in effect) \"It takes a bad bill a year to get passed in Annapolis. It takes a good bill two or more.\" That will be put to the test again this year.\n\n*— Woody Woodruff*","order":2},{"title":"NSA's Political and Economic Crisis","date":"2014-01-03","issue":"January 2014","author":"Daniel Adkins","body":"Most discussion on the National Security Agency is concerned about its voracious appetite for electronic records and its conflict with the 4<sup>th</sup> Amendment^1^ – the part of the [Bill of Rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights) that prohibits unreasonable [searches and seizures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_seizure) and requires any [warrant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_%28law%29) to be judicially sanctioned and supported by [probable cause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause). Although some NSA searches are covered by warrants, other efforts just scoop up data streams between data centers. This is to say nothing of scooping up foreign data streams through the U.S and worldwide.\n\nNSA does have a legitimate goal of detecting and dealing with terrorists. Yet it is alleged that NSA cannot read many messages it collects due to a lack of Arabic and Farsi translators. One wonders what is NSA's goal if it is not to be capable of reading the messages? It does boggle the mind that the U.S. now has a surveillance system for the whole world that Hitler or Stalin could have only imagined in their dreams.\n\nNSA is a highly hierarchal and secret agency. Signals intelligence and communication intelligence (SIGINT and COMINT) are and have been among the most closely guarded of secrets. The breaking of the German and Japanese codes during World War II resulted in important victories at Midway and fighting the U-Boats, although U.S. industrial production was decisive in the war. NSA culture treats opponents such as al Qaeda and Iran as existential enemies like Japan and Germany. Yet the nature of the current conflicts is much more complicated than World War II or the Cold War. The West and most of the world (countries that are part of the global market) are engaged in a social-political conflict with al Qaeda that in many ways is a cultural reaction to multi-nationalism and religious extremism. One should remember that on 9-11 the U.S. military establishment was only able to oppose al Qaeda by launching two unarmed fighter planes to kamikaze the fourth hijacked plane. An *informed* public (passengers) brought down that plane! So it would follow that cooperating with the public and allies rather than just scanning them would be in order. Also, al Qaeda is a political as much as a military opponent in that how we respect and relate to Islam may be more important to combating al Qaeda than killing its terrorists would be. Yet NSA is trying to win the struggle by itself when almost the whole world is on its side.\n\nThere are three main trends in the Middle East. The Arab Spring has started a rising appetite, especially for the young, for a functional life and economy without graft, favoritism, and corruption. Rising education levels and expectations support that trend. Second, Islamist trends like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Turkish government try successfully (or not) to link religious traditions with governments. In Egypt this trend failed by not paying attention to the economy and the future. This Islamist trend does not necessarily pose a security threat of the sort that that the religious extremism of al Qaeda or the Taliban does. However, and thirdly, the chaos of the transitions has made an opening for al Qaeda and other extremists. NSA does have a role in protecting us from those consequences of chaos but the U.S. has a bad habit of trying to solve problems just by technical means and ignoring social, cultural, and political dimensions. The technical methods worked in World War II and to some extent in the Cold War. Now the world is more connected and requires a more fully informed and cultural solution.\n\nNow let us assess the economic and international consequence of this surveillance and the impact on the strongest U.S. economic sector. One cost is that there now are economic, political, and ethical reasons not to useU.S. corporations' clouds (data centers), hardware, and any communication lines passing through our territory. Any firm or country that does not want the U.S. government to know all their secrets has to think more than twice about using services provided by U.S. corporations. The world may view our internet [*hardware and software as compromised*](http://allthingsd.com/20131230/the-nsa-and-silicon-valley/) in the same way the U.S. government now views Chinese hardware. The U.S. government forbids its agencies to use Chinese communications equipment because it may, by design, compromise our security. U.S. corporations may protest this issue to buyers, but everyone knows that the U.S. government requires secrecy of its industry agreements. In other words, NSA has just undercut our tech industry's international balance of payments as well as our national and corporate trustworthiness. Major tech companies are [*now protesting these actions*](http://reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/).\n\nMuch of the world's communications goes through the U.S. because our industry has developed earlier and has had greater financing. This infrastructure includes satellites, landlines, and undersea cables. NSA has angered Brazil and if Brazil is serious about avoiding NSA spying it will expand undersea cables and satellites to send its emails and data to Africa and thus avoid routing them through the U.S. That would be the only way for South Americans to secure their data privacy in communications with Europe, Africa and even Asia. An example of this logic is the global GPS systems. The U.S. and Russia have their own, and Europe and China will not be far behind creating their own systems to ensure their full access so as not to depend on the U.S. NSA's unilateral actions and the U.S. government's inaction will lead other countries to feel that they are being treated like colonies. This may have been avoided by public country-to-country agreements, but protests from Germany and Brazil suggest there are no such agreements. If the goal is to fight al Qaeda, such agreements should be easy as terrorists do not have the backing of most of the world's governments.\n\nAnother consequence of scooping up data streams (without warrants) between the cloud data centers of Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Twitter, Mozilla, Facebook, Apple, and others, is that those companies are now beginning to encrypt their data streams to protect users from unlawful snooping. [*Microsoft's general counsel stated*](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/microsofts-general-counsel-n-s-a-hacks-were-an-earthquake-for-tech/), \"We want to live in a world that is safe and secure, but we also want to live in a country that is governed by the Constitution.\" Protecting customers' privacy and our corporations' reputations via encryption adds a business cost to the world's tech industry and NSA.\n\nThe end result of NSA's surveillance is likely to be an erosion of U.S. influence as our hubris prevents partners from seeing us as acting with their collective interest. NSA's military outlook toward al Qaeda is understandable, but the insularity of the \"intelligence community\" has blocked both domestic and international cooperation as well as respect for the Constitution. Our winner-take-all commercial and political culture is shrinking our economic clout as the world develops and we create a \"1984\" culture in a divided nation. The intelligence agencies view their fight as an existential fight for safety, but the phone-logging program has <span id=\"_Hlt249792807\" class=\"anchor\"></span>not been necessary in stopping terrorist attacks [*according to the White House panel's report.*](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/us/politics/report-on-nsa-surveillance-tactics.html?_r=0) Others see that there are more options for security in cooperating with allies and the public by using a wider range of techniques and knowledge of cultures, languages, religious communities, and sciences beyond electronics and at the same time protecting our economy.\n\nMore recent events have suggested a review of NSA's programs and a report by President Obama due in January. The tech industry has met with Obama sharing their concerns of how NSA is limiting their viability and trust. One federal judge has stated that phone meta-data collection is likely unconstitutional,[ *but another disagreed Dec. 27, possibly setting up an early Supreme Court encounter.*](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/us/nsa-phone-surveillance-is-lawful-federal-judge-rules.html?hp&_r=0) [*A White House panel's review of NSA programs *](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/us/politics/report-on-nsa-surveillance-tactics.html)has not found the security benefit of stopping a single imminent attack and made a recommendation that phone companies hold their data longer in order to be accessed by NSA using warrants. The full report is yet to be detailed and may leave other forms of data collection by NSA untouched. It is interesting that NSA is quick to label Snowden a treasonous traitor when the chain of command in NSA has sworn to protect the Constitution and the result casts doubt on their oaths.","order":3},{"title":"Revolutionary Lives in the Making of New South Africa","date":"2014-01-03","issue":"January 2014","author":"Carolyn M. Byerly","body":"Review of *Ruth First and Joe Slovo in the War Against Apartheid*, by Alan Wieder, Monthly Review Press, 2013.\n\nAs the world was saying goodbye to Nelson Mandela in early December, I had my nose in Alan Wieder's well-researched new biography *Ruth First and Joe Slovo in the War Against Apartheid* (Monthly Review, 2013). First, Slovo and Mandela were part of an ensemble of revolutionary comrades who together reshaped South Africa from the 1950s to the end of apartheid in 1991. The book is full of these and other familiar characters in a level of detail that would impress the most ardent Talmudic scholar. Wieder's research involved hours and hours of interviews and immersing himself in court records, other documents and the personal papers of Slovo, First and others from the apartheid era.\n\nThis article – a summary more than a critique – has the goal of drawing a profile of revolutionary lives that were fully committed but also full of contradictions, interesting but also mundane in many ways. Because their lives individually and jointly tell the story of apartheid and its liberation, it is impossible to separate the \"personal and political\" of these two remarkable historical figures.\n\nRuth First (<http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/ruth-herloise-first>), a journalist who was assassinated by the South African security forces with a mail bomb in 1982, made her mark reporting on the atrocities of the apartheid government for the *Guardian* and other left-leaning newspapers, beginning in the mid-1950s. Joe Slovo (<http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/joe-slovo>), a lawyer, made his mark challenging the regime by legally defending poor black Africans against everything from petty crimes to more serious allegations. He died of leukemia in 1995 while serving as the minister of housing in Mandela's government.\n\nThe husband and wife political team came to their radical inclinations quite differently. First was born in South Africa of Jewish socialist parents who had immigrated to South Africa from Lithuania and Latvia to escape persecution. Her father became a small businessman in Johannesburg and did well, allowing Ruth to grow up in middle class surroundings and to intellectually engage in politics. Joe was born in Lithuania of poor Yiddish-speaking, observant Jewish parents. Not long after his family immigrated to South Africa, his mother died, leaving his father to support and raise several young children. They shifted from one boarding house to another, the father working at jobs where he could, but spending time in jail for debts when he had no work.\n\nRuth went to college from high school; Joe was forced to work. His lodgings put him among a rag-tag bunch that included some Zionist-Marxists. Having already abandoned religious Judaism, he also turned away from Zionism, feeling that the Zionists cared more about events in Palestine than the oppressive situation going on around them. Joe became immersed in the latter. It was the 1940s and the coming of the apartheid era.\n\nThe Union of South Africa, formed by merging former British colonies with those of the Boers (Afrikaners), had been historically racist in its policies but would become more so after statehood. In 1913, the Land Act was passed, forbidding blacks from buying land outside the reserves set aside for them. These were followed by the infamous \"pass laws\" (requiring blacks and coloreds to carry ID cards) and other measures to control the interaction of the races.\n\nThe institutionalized racism known as apartheid came dramatically in 1948 when the National Party came to power. Laws (<http://africanhistory.about.com/library/bl/blsalaws.htm>) were passed forbidding both sex and marriage between whites and those of other races and restricting residency of native Africans to townships. In 1950, the Population Registration Act required every South African to be classified by race, a law that would form the basis for a totally racialized society. In 1951, the Native Building Workers Act limited the places where skilled blacks were allowed to work; and in 1953, the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act allowed racial segregation in public facilities and vehicles. In 1956, the Industrial Conciliation Act forbade formation of racially mixed labor unions and legalized the reservation of skilled jobs for white workers.\n\nBlacks had formally organized resistance to white repression around the time of the nation's founding. The Native National Congress (later the ANC), founded in 1912, and the Communist Party, with ties to Russian Bolsheviks and later Stalinists, were the strongest opponents. Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, and Chris Hani were among the ANC's leaders and would become close allies of First and Slovo, who held membership in both organizations. These groups led mass protests, strikes, burned passes and otherwise resisted the repression.\n\nLiving a revolutionary life meant social and political circles overlapped closely for First and Slovo, who had met through CP activities. Ruth, Wieder says, was a \"remarkable journalist\" who was \"wholly concerned with identifying and exposing the horrors of racial rule.\" Her most famous story was written in 1951 on the enslavement of Bethal farm workers. She also reported on the government seizure of black land, township conditions, and other atrocities. Her stories and commentaries, it was said, \"kept the spark alive.\" Her paper, the *Guardian* (<http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica>) was banned numerous times, each time to re-emerge under a new name with similar oppositional stories. She also engaged in political protests, particularly in support of black women, who felt the brunt of apartheid strongly. Some noted that her journalism often had a participant-observer aspect to it, as when she reported on the Federation of South African Women's campaign against passes, a campaign she was herself involved in. Her reporting \"provided both motivation and ground rules for future women's actions,\" according to Wieder. She mentored young black writers to enter the profession and report from their own perspectives.\n\nJoe, who had eventually completed law school, traveled around the nation to defend blacks accused of violating the apartheid laws. He had a brilliant legal mind and compelling courtroom manner. By the mid-1950s, his life became more secretive, attending political meetings at night and sharing only necessary details with Ruth and others. His activities included planning and abetting massive strikes in protest against repressive labor laws. First and Slovo were both stalked by the government and eventually put on trial for treason with scores of black Africans. Charges were eventually dropped, but in 1963, they fled. Other major leaders also went into exile, as the ANC had become a banned political group. Mandela was tried for treason, given a life sentence and sent to Robben Island.\n\nFirst and Slovo's long exile was spent mostly in London, where Wieder observes they \"had a full social life.\" One of the contradictions in these radicals' lives was their class privilege, which allowed them to live well even while they fought against the squalor and injustices others' experienced. While living in Johannesburg, the family (Joe, Ruth and their three daughters) had taken annual vacations to the beaches of Cape Town; they had black domestic help, and otherwise lived a bourgeois life. Joe, who had grown up very poor, came to enjoy \"a good meal and a cigar,\" and both liked to party. They differed from most white South African bourgeoisie by having a multicultural circle of friends, who included the other revolutionaries of all races who came to enjoy social gatherings at their home – something expressly forbidden by law.\n\nIn London while exiled, they went to the theater and enjoyed other cultural events. But \"good food and good company did not preclude politics for Joe Slovo or Ruth First\" during their exile. Joe became involved in recruiting Irish leftists for political propaganda forays into South Africa, Wieder says, and Ruth continued her \"torrid pace of writing\", including speeches and media work. She produced a special on Frantz Fanon for the ATV Network in London, and completed research for and first draft for her book *The Barrel of a Gun*, a socialist critique of post-colonial African leaders. The book, which emphasized that power lies in the hands of those who control the means of violence, would catapult her into the academic world. The book's complex analysis, which involved politics, economics and other factors, broke new ground in explaining post-colonial Africa and was well reviewed in academic journals. Though having no PhD, she was sought out by the sociology faculty of Durham University, where she served from 1973 to 1978, teaching courses on Marx and Weber, as well as the sociology of gender, the last of these signaling her shift into feminist scholarship and feminist politics.\n\nJoe's life became more international, as he shuffled between Europe, Moscow, Berlin and various African nations interacting with communist and other leftist political leaders. Joe and Ruth had always held fierce political differences on some issues, one of them being his support for Stalinist policies in the USSR. In addition, both had always had extra-marital affairs, which caused conflict but also a kind of freedom in their individual pursuits. Though their expatriate life settled into its own brand of normalcy, both desired to return home and questioned why ANC leaders weren't doing more to bring themselves home and resume the fight against apartheid.\n\nIn 1978, exiled comrade Oliver Tambo organized a contingent of ANC members, including Slovo, to travel to Vietnam for training in guerrilla warfare. Ruth was living in Maputo, Mozambique, by then and Tambo's campaign enticed Joe to also return to Africa. Now at the Center for African Studies as director of research, Ruth hired young researchers to assist her with studies in Marx; academic research and writing occupied most of her time. In the role as director, she was also able to initiate agricultural projects that required city-bred African students to go into villages and live with goals to revolutionize agricultural production. She considered this period to be the most militant and productive in her life, bringing theory and practice together.\n\nJoe became deputy of the Operations Unit of the ANC after returning from Vietnam. He trained 20 soldiers at a time, teaching them to destroy oil refineries and other facilities. Joe's units were successful in bringing \"huge financial damage\" to the regime.\" Though gaining renown for these field operations, Joe came home to Ruth in their comfortable lifestyle, again pointing out the discrepancy of class relations in revolutionary work.\n\nWith increased coverage of the group's violence against the state by the South African press, which demonized the ANC, the government began what Wieder calls its \"reign of assassinations of ANC operatives in both South Africa and the border states.\" Ruth, a \"brilliant orator\" since high school, \"had a remarkable way with words\" and was speaking frequently in these days. She also continued her scholarship, completing work on the book *Olive Schreiner* and beginning research for *Black Gold*; Joe also began to write more and to travel, including a trip to the Soviet Union. Ruth was in her campus office, chatting with others around her, when she began to read her mail on the morning of August 17, 1982. One of the envelopes contained a bomb that exploded, killing her instantly. Those around her were injured but survived. Word of her death spread around the world quickly and comrades and friends and family reacted with eulogies, articles and concerts in her name. Heads of state and other dignitaries from around the world came to her funeral. Ruth's friend Ron Segal gave the eulogy, honoring her as a writer revolutionary, intellectual, feminist and teacher.\n\nFriends surrounded Joe, who was devastated. Those who knew Ruth and Joe said they always imagined it would be Joe they killed first. After the funeral, he began a regimen of swimming daily, meetings and writing. He worked through his grief by writing *Joe Slovo: An Unfinished Biography*. He returned to his special operations work against the government, from his new base in Lusaka, Zambia.\n\nThe world was changing. The Berlin wall came down in 1989 and soon after came the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Joe connected these dramatic changes to possibilities for similar shifts in South Africa. President de Klerk was giving signals that there would be a new future. He had released Walter Sisulu and Thabo Mbeki from prison; he unbanned the ANC; and in February 1990, he released Nelson Mandela. Joe returned to South Africa in April that year, after 27 years in exile. In Johannesburg, he would participate in negotiations that became the basis for the new South African Communist Party. At the same time, he reacted with culture shock at what he was seeing – blacks and whites on buses together, talking in the streets, middle class blacks living in white areas.\n\nBoth the ANC and SACP began to redefine themselves to participate openly in the political process. On July 19, Joe proposed the unilateral cessation of armed struggle, something that Mandela supported. But there would be a power struggle within the SACP over the issue, something the press covered, but the problem eventually was resolved. Mandela's election in 1994 brought many of his old comrades into government, something they could not have imagined decades earlier. Instead of appointing Joe to the Justice Ministry, as everyone supposed would happen, Mandela asked him to be Minister of Housing. Joe Slovo, who some called the \"most hated white man in South Africa\" took over an agency still full of staff from the apartheid era. To build trust and good relations, he established collaborative principles of working and dispensed with formalities, including a chauffeur. He began to lunch with the rank and file staff. He summoned leaders from banking, building industries and civic organizations to develop plans for public housing.\n\nIt would be his last mission to put his politics into practice. Joe Slovo was diagnosed with leukemia in 1994 and died a year later, leaving his second wife, Helena Dolny and daughters Gillian, Robyn, and Shawn.\n\n*Personal reflection*. Having spent a week or so in Johannesburg four or five years ago, I read this biography knowing full well that the \"new\" South Africa is still a long way from being realized. The wealthy Afrikaner bankers and industrialists, who brokered the end of apartheid and to whom Mandela ultimately sold out, still dominate the economy. Mandela's government was never able to bring about education, redistribution of resources, or even better housing for the masses of poor black Africans before it passed to the hands of his successors, and neither have they fully accomplished these things. The nation is still racially divided in many ways for all of its advancements, not the least of which is its progressive Constitution. And yet there is an admirable progress and, among those I met of all races, a determination to look forward, not back. Alan Wieder's interesting critical account of First and Slovo's lives is at once a social history and a biography. In the end, it reminded me that revolutionaries are real flesh and blood people – passionate, complicated, imperfect, and with varied levels of success in what they are able to do given historical circumstances. The lessons in these and other things, replete through the book's 390 pages, may inform our own activist impulses.\n\nTo read more about the implications that the South African story has for the United States, read Arun Gupta's commentary <http://truth-out.org/news/item/20893-make-new-york-city-ungovernable-lessons-from-the-anti-apartheid-struggle-in-the-age-of-bill-de-blasio>.\n\nThere is renewed interest in South Africa and its lessons for others on the political left, particularly with regard to the enduring socialist question, \"Can the Left govern\"? Others are also chiming in on this subject.\n\nSee Danny Schechter's new book, [*Madiba A to Z, the Many Faces of Nelson Mandela* ](http://truth-out.org/progressivepicks/item/20974-mandela-was-unable-to-dismantle-the-white-oligarchy-keeping-south-africa-in-economic-chainshttp:/)","order":4},{"title":"Socialism Defended With Wit & Style","date":"2014-01-03","issue":"January 2014","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"A book review of ***Why Marx Was Right***, by Terry Eagleton (2011, New Haven & London). Yale University Press; hard cover, $25.\n\nOne highly intriguing fact about the Marxist theory of revolution is that for the last century, an enormous number of American conservatives who know surprisingly little about it have found it remarkably simple to identify its worst flaws.\n\nWhen I graduated from elementary school back in 1960, for example, my libertarian Republican friends and I knew full well that Marx believed in the virtues of a totalitarian political state and the utter insignificance of the individual. When I entered college later on, a number of the earnest Christian liberals I met at my church group at the University of Michigan were convinced of the fact that Marx was a complete economic determinist who rejected the notion of freedom. We Christians might have believed in original sin, of course, and the extreme Calvinists taught the \"innate depravity\" of each individual soul, but at least we differed from the Communists in admiring human dignity.\n\nMany radical environmental activists who joined in the University of Michigan's version of the Earth Day, 1970 teach-ins, similarly, were painfully aware that Marxists, the same people who had achieved total political power in the Soviet Union, perversely believed in the human conquest over nature, despite the damage thus wreaked on the world. And to be fair to the environmentalists, a few of the campus Marxists who turned out to protest against our \"middle class\" environmental protests in 1970 knew exactly the same thing.\n\nIn fairness to Marx and his intellectual legacy, much of what conservative and liberal critics have always \"known\" about him is wrong. In fairness to the critics, on the other hand, Marx was a complicated 19<sup>th</sup> century thinker with a propensity for embellishing *Capital* with quotations in ancient Greek, and as a young man he unfortunately developed an elaborately German sense of humor. Socialists and Communists since the late 1800s have faced extremely daunting challenges in translating some of his theories into practice, and for much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century a big part of the international socialist left took its marching orders from Stalin's Soviet Union, where the conservatives had some good reasons to point to totalitarian abuse by the State.\n\nWas the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its followers in the 1940s and 1950s basically correct about what Marxism means? Are Tea Party Republicans or even liberal Democrats today basically correct in finding Marxism to be an outmoded political ideology, one totally discredited by the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union? Is Marx one dead white European male whose latter day followers have been incapable of appreciating the merits of modern radical movements such as feminism, environmentalism, gay liberation and the struggle for racial justice?\n\nIn *Why Marx Was Right,* the Anglo-Irish literary critic Terry Eagleton takes on 10 of the most commonly help misconceptions about Marx and Marxism, and unlike some socialist defenders of the Truth Faith, Eagleton does so with a good deal of flair, intelligence and wit.\n\nEagleton himself seems like an unlikely and somewhat contradictory Marxist. A former associate of Christopher Hitchens in the British Trotskyist movement, Eagleton also happens to a believing Catholic, and the dust jacket to this book contains the publisher's praise for his previous work *Reason, Faith, and Revolution: Reflects on the God Debate*. According to a blurb from the *Guardian* , which Yale University Press chose to quote on the dust jacket, *Reason, Faith and Revolution* offers a \"coruscating brilliant polemic\" against the kind of militant atheism that Hitchens espoused as a reason for George Bush to make war on \"Islamo-Fascism\" following the 9/11 attack.\n\nAnother recent Eagleton work, judging from the dust jacket, is titled *On Evil*, and a reviewer for the Irish Times apparently finds it \"a valuable contribution to a debate as old as Adam and Eve and as contemporary as 9/11 and Abu Ghraib.\"\n\nIn other words, Eagleton is hardly dogmatic in his defense of Marx, who was an explicitly atheist thinker, and both as a Catholic and a former Trotskyist, he expresses serious intellectual reservations about some of Marx's historical conclusions. Like most Trotskyists, he expresses strong condemnation of the bloodshed and totalitarian terror that he sees as having attended both the Chinese and the Russian revolutions, while at the same time emphasizing that both revolutions contributed significantly to economic development for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nPerhaps because of his Catholicism, perhaps only because of common sense, Eagleton also emphasizes that for all of its scope, Marxism cannot be thought of as a \"Theory of Everything,\" even if many Marxists have wanted to make it one. He writes:\n\n> The fact that Marxism has nothing very interesting to say about malt > whiskies or the nature of the unconscious, the haunting fragrance of a > rose or why there is something rather than nothing, is not to its > discredit It is not a total philosophy ... It has been mostly silent on > questions of love, death and the meaning of life.\"\n\nYet in the wake of the near-implosion of the capitalist world economy following the great financial crisis of 2008, Eagleton insists, Marxism as a way of understanding capitalism and formulating ways to go beyond it is as relevant as ever. The main reason so many political radicals rejected it following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, he concludes, was not because it was no longer relevant — but was because capitalism at the time seemed invincible. But it doesn't seem that way today.\n\nEagleton goes on in this book to examine and refute ten of the most commonly held misconceptions about Marx and Marxism, including the myth that Marx – who called the State an instrument of \"class oppression\" and called for it ultimately to \"wither away\" – was somehow an advocate of an all-powerful government that would negate all individual rights. In fact, Eagleton argues, Marx was an advocate of a \"communist\" society that would foster the flourishing of individual lives and individual talent, and there are solidly \"Marxist\" and materialist reasons why the Bolshevik attempt to establish a revolutionary socialist order in politically and economically backward Russia, in 1917, was almost fated to generate gross abuses of individuality and democratic rights instead.\n\nOne excellent feature of *Why Marx Was Right* is Eagleton's obvious familiarity with features of Marx's thought and Marxist practice that have never come to the attention of most American conservatives and anti-socialist liberals. What may be even better about the book for the average reader is that Eagleton is a prominent literary critic, and an Irish Catholic one to boot. As such, he has flair for lively writing and wit that Marx, for all his intellectual virtues, sometimes lacked.\n\nWhether Eagleton's prose can match that of other Irish writers such as George Bernard Shaw or Oscar Wilde is debatable. But in this book, Eagleton has produced a body of pro-socialist arguments that are fun to read, not simply \"important.\"","order":5},{"title":"THE JOYS OF LEAFLETTING and DC-DSA's Fight Against Further Cuts in Food Stamps","date":"2014-01-03","issue":"January 2014","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"I was walking down Connecticut Ave. near Dupont Circle when she approached to ask me for seventy-five cents. Supposedly it was for a Metro fare to Silver Spring, which I doubted. Yet today I handed over the change anyway, for I had a hidden agenda.\n\n\"How do you feel about Congress cutting food stamps?\" I asked. She said it was terrible; she knew many people who needed food stamps to eat; they'd have a really hard time on reduced benefits. Congress is crazy to do this, she said.\n\nSo I showed her Metro DC DSA's flyer against further cuts in food stamp funding under the next Farm Bill, with phone numbers where people can call to protest to Congress about the proposed changes. And she took some flyers to distribute to her friends — in fact, she asked me for 75 of them.\n\nI had a similar experience when I asked the medical technician in my doctor's office about how she felt about Congress cutting the food stamp program. She replied with a small lecture about what it would mean for single mothers trying to raise two or three children. \"They're going to get money to feed their children by any means necessary, \" she predicted; this meant more street crime and prostitution ahead. When I showed her the DSA flyers she took 35 of them, and said she'd pass them along to people in her church.\n\nA waiter at the restaurant where I went after my annual checkup agreed it was insane for the government to reduce food stamp benefits given the slack growth in jobs in this economy; he took flyers for himself and a friend or two. A homeless street vendor near my downtown office scanned the contents of the flyer, nodded to himself, and asked for 100 to hand out to people in his mother's neighborhood in Anacostia. A security guard took 75 to give to her neighbors. And when I knocked at the back door of a downtown evangelical church, the middle-aged white man who answered said he needed food stamps himself; he'd take 30 flyers to hand to others in the congregation.\n\nSome long-time socialists who've contributed a lot to DSA over the years hate handing out radical flyers to strangers. I can't blame them. It seems undignified; it takes a bit of gall if you're a naturally shy person; you're basically intruding on someone else's space, and some people resent it. Also it's easy to feel hopeless when you're trying to press a bit of socialist propaganda on someone who really doesn't want to read it.\n\nBut when our chapter's Steering Committee in early December decided to authorize the preparation and distribution of a DSA flyer urging local residents to call Congress in opposition to further cuts in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding — SNAP being the new name for the old food stamps program – I believe we hit on a message that many people in DC, Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland actually do want to read.\n\nAccording to recent articles in the *Washington Post* and the *Baltimore Sun*, as well as information on the web sites of charitable food bank organizations in our region, some 101,000 D.C. residents have recently depended on food stamps to some degree for their basic nutritional needs. In Maryland, the USDA has found an estimated 720,000 people to be \"food insecure,\" and even in Loudoun County, Virginia, which reportedly has the highest average per-capital income in the United States, some 82,000 people went to church and charitable food banks last year for some of their groceries.\n\nNationwide, upwards of 47 million Americans have received food stamps in recent years – a number that conservative Republicans and not a few congressional Democrats now seem eager to cut, by slashing billions of dollars in funding from SNAP expenditures in future years. On November 1, 2013, food stamp recipients and hunger advocacy groups got a taste of austerity to come when Congress, under the 2013 sequestration deal, allowed food stamp funding to drop by $5 billion from its previous all-time high.\n\nBecause of the large numbers of needy people involved, and probably also because of the wide coverage that food stamp and hunger issues have recently received in the local and national media, a big fraction of the people living in the Metro DC area were already concerned about the food stamp issue by last December. Many local residents therefore have willingly taken our flyers. The local DSA Steering Committee authorized expenditures for the printing of 500 flyers, initially; since then, individual DSA members acting independently have printed up roughly 1,500 more.\n\nBy late December, nearly all these had been handed out – in some cases to local DSA members, in many other cases, to sympathetic non-socialists who have promised to distribute them more widely to friends, family and community – not because they necessarily agree with democratic socialism, but because of their deep concern about the pain that further SNAP funding reductions will cause.\n\nCan DSA members, either locally or nationally, hope to build \"socialism\" or a socialist movement by trying to rally members of the public to call on a conservative-leaning Congress to protect a \"liberal\" and not especially generous welfare program – namely SNAP?\n\nNot directly, no. Our flyers opposing food stamp cuts, although they mention DSA's name and give readers directions to our local and national web sites, say nothing at all about socialism or even the major flaws in capitalism that make hunger and malnutrition and poverty so surprisingly present in the world's richest capitalist society.\n\nHowever, what some of us are hoping is that by distributing these flyers in significant numbers, and by urging readers to contact Congress soon to save existing SNAP funds, we may help to rally local low-wage working people, the jobless and homeless, and enlightened middle-class liberals to act politically in their own class interest.\n\nAt the DSA national convention last October, delegates approved of a resolution identifying the struggle against \"neo-liberal\" budget austerity as one central priority for democratic socialists this year. Fighting Congress to save food stamps from further reductions is only a part of that anti-austerity struggle, but some of us in the chapter hope that it will support the larger anti-austerity struggle.\n\nBeyond this, several DSA activists at the national level have recently expressed growing interest in the political theories of Antonio Gramsci, an influential Marxist thinker imprisoned by Mussolini in the 1920s and 1930s. Our chapter's food stamp flyers, in whatever limited fashion, are partly an attempt to put into practice a little of what Gramsci wrote about the need for socialists to wage a \"counter-hegemonic\" struggle in basically conservative capitalist societies, such as Italy in the 1920s and the United States today.\n\nAs Michael Harrington, one of the cofounders of DSA, noted in his last *book, Socialism: Past and Future**,*** Gramsci, a fiery would-be revolutionary himself, played an important role in the 1930s in recognizing that in most prosperous western capitalist societies, the majority of working people are not revolutionary, contrary to Marx's predictions from the 19<sup>th</sup> century.\n\nUnder those circumstances, Gramsci wrote, socialists need to recognize that capitalists combat the spread of socialist ideas not only through military and economic coercion – though these are important – but also through moral and intellectual means, through what Gramsci called the \"hegemony\" of capitalist values as promoted by the press, the entertainment industry, the established political parties and in many cases the established churches.\n\nTo make change under these difficult circumstances, Gramsci argued, socialists must work to create a \"counter-hegemony\" to capitalism by formulating and defending key moral values, in almost the way that the Catholic Church in Gramsci's Italy had long formulated and popularized conservative and anti-leftist ones. Gramsci died in 1937, long before the Italian Communist Party (the PCI) could put his ideas about \"counter-hegemony\" into practice. But after World War II had put an end to Italian fascism, the PCI – a tiny minority party before — achieved a surprisingly healthy growth and considerable political influence in Italy by doing just that.\n\nWriting personally, and not necessarily on behalf of everyone in the DC-DSA steering committee, I am hoping that by taking public positions on such obvious moral issues as opposition to food stamp cuts for the poor, DSA at the local level can begin to carve out a small amount of \"counter-hegemonic\" space for socialist ideas people in the metropolitan area who have the most to lose from the capitalist politics of austerity.\n\nI also think it's obvious that simply fighting for SNAP funding this year can only be a small step that direction. But if our local chapter can follow up our effort on SNAP by continued efforts to promote Rep. John Conyer's \"jobs for all bill\" and the notion of a financial transaction tax to make further budget austerity unnecessary, I think we have a chance of helping local low-wage workers to Fight the Powers That Be.\n\nAnd to the extent we can produce and distribute additional literature that tells DC residents things that they actually want to hear, I hope that some of us can find \"joy in leafleting,\" while helping to build public awareness of DSA and its political positions on more complicated topics.","order":6},{"title":"Working People Can Win: A review of Sam Pizzigati's \"The Rich Don't Always Win\"","date":"2014-01-03","issue":"January 2014","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"Sisyphus was condemned to forever roll a huge rock to the top of a hill, then, just before reaching the summit, watch it roll down again. A myth from ancient times that speaks to much of what those struggling for economic and social justice experience with victories won rare and all-too-fleeting. The weight of unjust power by the few means that inequality and injustice persist despite the best efforts of so many to bring about change.\n\nYet it need not be so for it has not always been so – a point well made by Sam Pizzigati in his book, *The Rich Don't Always Win* (Seven Seas Press, 2012). The book's subtitle, \"The Forgotten Triumph over Plutocracy that Created the American Middle Class,1900-1970,\" serves as a reminder that the summit can be reached. He provides a history that bears repeating in this era of seeming neo-liberal invincibility. Economic policy leading to the destruction of jobs and pensions, the breakdown of communities and the loss of good schools, stemmed from fiscal and tax policies that prioritized ending inflation as opposed to ending unemployment – a direction that has been dominant since Ronald Reagan's triumph in 1980.\n\nForeshadowed by initiatives undertaken by the Ford and Carter administrations, those policies did not come out of the blue. Rather they were implemented as a reaction by capital to something that had been won – strong unions and social welfare systems that resulted in a steady decline in poverty levels, wage standards that put college education and homeownership within the reach of most. It was a reaction\nby the wealthy to redistributionist tax policies that limited the gap\nbetween the rich and working people and prevented the degree of inequality of income (and therefore power) that undermines any pretense of political democracy. Pizzigati, currently at the Institute for Policy Studies, was long active in the labor movement and worked for the National Education Association for over twenty years, serving as the union's director of publications. At 384 pages, this book may seem too lengthy, but it is well written and the combination of detail, substantive information and anecdotes illustrating past views and struggles, give his narrative a sense of flow that most political and historical writing lacks.\n\nPizzigati begins his story at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The defeat of the combined Democratic/Populist campaign of William Jennings Bryan left the country firmly in the hands of the handpicked representative of business, William McKinley. The rich and powerful not only had one of their own in the White House; thinly veiled corruption meant that the Senate and the House, most state governments, and the judiciary, were also firmly in their pockets. What followed were a set of measures designed to prevent challenges to the rule of capital such as those that exploded from time to time in the decades after the Civil War. Now protected – by law, by police power, by business monopoly, by banking consolidation, by government action and inaction – such resistance seemed to face dim prospects. As well, direct power brandished by authorities was augmented by a dominant worldview that gave credence to the idea that the wealthy deserved their riches, the poor deserved their poverty. Extremes of inequality of income and political power followed that seemed unstoppable.\n\nBut popular movements refused to give in to despair or to stop organizing against the prevailing order. Pizzigati recounts how a mixture of reformers and revolutionaries – muckraker journalists, socialists, moderate and radical unionists, the \"settlement\" movement amongst the urban poor, farmer and sharecropper activists, wealthy individuals appalled at the selfishness and ignorance of their peers, academics who challenged the prevailing wisdom, and numerous others organized to give voice to the voiceless, strength to the marginalized, and a change in the climate of opinion throughout the country. There was never any formal organizational or political unity among these varied movements. To the contrary, activists had strong differences that were often fiercely argued. Nonetheless, these movements did interact with each other and most never lost sight of the fact that the principal danger facing US society was that of concentrated wealth. Thus, cumulatively, these various organizations and individuals reinforced positive, democratic changes in society.\n\nBy 1912 all candidates ran on a reform platform. Theodore Roosevelt led a split within the Republican Party based on a call for more regulation of the economy, forcing the Republican incumbent, William Howard Taft, to campaign on a program that most Democrats, let alone Republicans, would today find hard to accept. Eugene Debs, the Socialist Party candidate, won 6% of the national vote, a figure that would have been higher if the Democratic Party candidate Woodrow Wilson had not stolen large parts of the Socialist platform with calls for social welfare and support for taxes on inherited wealth.\n\nReal change began to take place during the Wilson Administration – changes furthered but also cut short by the experience of World War I. It was a time too that saw reform and radical movements reach new heights of strength and new depths of mutual antagonism. Those who sought to work within the system through support of the war saw the imposition of taxes on wealth, the development of protections for labor – and the expansion of union membership – overcoming business opposition that previously had kept such changes at bay. Those who condemned the war saw in it the growth of an authoritarian corporate state that used national security to suppress dissent, shut down debate of radical alternatives, and promote a militarism necessarily hostile to democratic values.\n\nThat prophecy proved true. Violence swept through the land when the war ended, with an anti-union, anti-radical, racist offensive across the country that put reaction back in the saddle, undid most of the reforms that had been won and destroyed labor's hard won gains. Progressive reform and left-wing radical movements were divided within themselves and among themselves, and the loss of what had been painfully gained led to demoralization. The administrations of Harding, Coolidge and Hoover saw business get what it wanted no matter what the social cost. In consequence, according to figures Pizzigati cites, by 1928, 1% of the population owned 23.9% of the nation's wealth. Such extreme inequality, in turn, contributed to the stock market crash, ushering in the Great Depression, the worst economic decline in US history.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. Labor and social reform movements — Socialist, Communist and independent left organizers, middle-class liberals and activists of all stripes — drew on the legacy of protest, resistance and action from proceeding decades and this time achieved more lasting success. Real tax reform did lead to wealth redistribution and a more equitable society, the labor movement did grow in size and strength, regulations with teeth helped limit the power of banks and created a genuine social welfare safety net. For a little more than a decade, from the early 1930s through the mid-1940s, the rich and powerful were forced to retreat as working people won victories that seemed unimaginable before (as they may seem unimaginable today). Real price controls, controls on profits, and maximum incomes all received genuine consideration as potential policies. Economic planning during World War II created a framework that prevailed until the mid-1970s.\n\nThis framework was so long-lasting, Pizzigati explains, because it rested on two critical foundations,\n\n\\[First\\] ... a system of sharply graduated progressive tax rates that placed the lion's share of the tax burden on those most able to bear it. The second: a vital trade union presence in workplaces all across the United States. The tax system bankrolled the public services that enabled entry into America's new middle class. The union presence forced employers to share the wealth the post war economy was creating. Together, complementing each other, unions and progressive taxes prevented the accumulation of private fortunes powerful enough to sabotage the nation's new economic order. (p. 13)\n\nThese reforms were roughly co-extensive with Franklin Roosevelt's four presidential terms of office, but they can neither be reduced to the fact of his mixture of compassion and pragmatism, nor to Eleanor Roosevelt's more committed vision of social justice. Rather their achievements, the New Deal itself, were the result of millions of men and women understanding that democratic progress is possible and acting on that conviction. True, the power structure did not change during those years, nor did the class struggle disappear. Rather, those were the golden years of capitalism, yet golden years in which working people had more security, more possibility of advancement than ever before. Contradictions still existed, but the social struggles of the 1950s-70s were able to build on that already created foundation.\n\nPublished in 1962 and 1963, Betty Friedan's *The Feminine Mystique*, highlighting the continued second-class status of women, Rachel Carson's *Silent Spring* focusing attention on the emerging environmental dangers posed by our profit making industrial system, Michael Harrington's *The Other America*, pointing out the continued poverty amidst plenty, all took for granted that change could happen, that the \"rich don't always win,\" because they shared a legacy of popular victory that was still in living memory. In a sense this also animated the civil rights movement's battle against racial discrimination, the burgeoning anti-war movement, as well as the labor uprisings of farm workers and public service workers left behind in the previous wave of organizing gains. And so too it was the spirit behind an emerging youth culture and critical literary, arts and music scene that flourished (parallel to the flourishing of the New Left) from the late 1950s through the early 1970s as people felt able to ask more out of life than the existing system offered.\n\nYet the period of popular gains were to come to an end. Reaction returned with a vengeance and set the tone for the realities we now encounter. Pizzagati points out that in 2007, on the eve of the financial collapse and the Great Recession – with an impact that we live with still – 1% of the country owned 23.5% of the wealth – almost the same as in 1928. The causes for that reversal are legion, involving changes in the business cycle and the introduction of new technologies (with an impact already evident during Kennedy's first term of office) that undermined former centers of progressive power at a time when the labor movement had become complacent. At first unwilling to confront new challenges, labor was later too weak to do so successfully.\n\nTo that we can add that those in power full well understood the connection between popular power and equality – and so when social movements sought to build upon the New Deal by establishing genuine economic as well as social equality for all, business interests drew a line in the sand and were able to use various forms of prejudice, fear and insecurity to build political support for a retreat from the gains working people had made. The political victories won by the Business Roundtable following its 1972 founding mark the success of that strategy. Finally, the expansion of the US imperial order with the onset of the Cold War served as the Achilles heel of US progressivism, creating a framework that undermined democratic rule and opened the door for corporate power to reassert itself more strongly than ever. Such a reassertion of militarism has been a central thread in mainstream politics since that power was shaken by resistance to the Vietnam War.\n\nWhile understanding the causes of defeat of working people's movements are important, Pizzigati's book makes a powerful argument that it is more important is to understand the basis of the victory that was gained. Today's organizing among Walmart and fast food workers, the demands for more equitable taxing, universal health and guaranteed pensions, for banking regulations and environmental protection, for voting rights and immigration rights, for peace and military spending cuts, for civil liberties and equality in all facets of life may be seen in the not-too-distant future as harbingers of a more just society that is coming. Such movements will focus on different issues and objectives and frame their understanding of society, their short-range and long-range goals differently as well.\n\nReformers and radicals, movements of the urban poor, of immigrants, of university students, of already organized workers will all necessarily emphasize varying needs and develop varying organizations. There is neither the possibility nor the need to any formal unity amongst these, for strength today can grow out of the diversity of forms of progressive social protest. Nonetheless some unifying centers of ideas and goals are needed – and Pizzigati's work demonstrates the centrality of redistributionist tax policies and a strong trade union movement as the underlying basis for power counter to capital that can make all forms of progress, for a democracy rooted in equality possible.\n\nSisyphus had one break in his labor – when Orpheus in search of Eurydice played music so beautiful that even death paused. The moment any forever is broken stands as proof that what is need not always be so. Our labor for a better world is not – has not been – endless repetitions of the same; struggle made the world a better place at one time in history and can do so again. Allowing ourselves to hear the music of that possibility will allow us to see – and act – so that what may be, can be.\n\nResources:Sam Pizzagatti edits a weekly on-line publication: Too Much \"A commentary on Excess and Inequality ([*toomuchonline.org/*](http://toomuchonline.org/)‎). \"Antidotes to Avarice: A 2013 Top Ten,\" was posted on December 12.\n\n\n\nHis articles can be found at [*Inequality.org*](http://inequality.org/author/sam-pizzigati/)\n\nJoshua Freeman, *Working-Class New York* (Life and Labor Since World War II) (The New Press, 2000) provides a survey of the same time period as Pizzigati in a localized area.

This is, after all, a publication of the Left. And your faithful correspondent will not pass up the opportunity to bloviate on 2013&gt;2014.\n\nAs socialists, we are frequently tugged two ways – the vision way, and the \"what is to be done?\" way.\n\nIt's likely to be the same in 2014. Our writers and topics in the January issue fall on both the visionary and the practical side. The hope of nudging history slightly leftward in the DC elections, in the Maryland legislature, in the international political and trade spheres, in respect to the runaway intelligence agencies, and so forth pivot on the prospect of the usual activist trudge. Raymond Mungo, in his [*'60s era memoir of the Liberation News Service*](http://www.amazon.com/Famous-Long-Ago-Liberation-Service/dp/1558499474), took a cue from the large letters stenciled on curbside pavement marking the way across the street in New York City and called this kind of work \"PED-Xing.\" It can be as pedestrian as it is essential. But it makes it hard to keep an eye on the vision, sometimes.\n\nAll too often, instead, we have to map our vision with the help of books, and we review some good ones in this issue, as well. The visions of anti-apartheid activists in South Africa and of progressive battlers at home, as well as of Marx, the founding visionary, are treated. As we struggle to redress growing inequality with measures like an increase in the minimum wage, it's important to remind ourselves that:\n\n-   Modernity, increasingly, allows a broad public understanding of the productive work it takes to support a society in comfortable surplus;\n\n-   that that work and generous surplus can increasingly be accomplished by very short, socially managed shared worktimes and the surplus (like the work) shared rationally among private and public goods to reduce and even eliminate inequality;\n\n-   that the externalities of corporate capital that are ravaging our planet are remediable and likely reversible through the application of socially-based economic management;\n\n-   and that these facts (despite the countervailing lies) *are becoming more and more apparent to more and more of our fellow humans.* That's the hope of socialism and why we grind it out with letter-writing, lobbying, rallying and pamphleteering in our PED-Xing mode.\n\nLet the unknowns of 2014 and beyond yield to our practice to the extent we can execute it, and let our vision remain whole before us as the day-by-day offers us more opportunities to push that capitalist noodle leftward around the next blind curve. The work is before us, in 2014 as in every year.\n\n**FIRST, AN IMPORTANT WORD ABOUT OUR FEBRUARY MEETING:**\n\n**Metro-DC DSA to Consider Endorsements in DC Primary Election**\n*By Bill Mosley*\nAt its meeting on **Saturday, Feb. 8**, Metro-DC Democratic Socialists of America will consider endorsing candidates in the April 1 District of Columbia primary election.\n\n**The meeting will take place from 1:30-2:30 pm at the Cleveland Park Library, 3310 Connecticut Ave. NW, near the Cleveland Park Metro station.**\n\nPrimaries are being held by the Democratic, Republican, Statehood Green, and Libertarian parties. Offices on the ballot are mayor; council chairman; at-large councilmember; councilmembers for Wards 1, 3, 5 and 6; delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives; U.S. senator; U.S. representative; and, for voters in the Democratic primary, members of the Democratic national and state committees. (The delegate to the U.S. House, a salaried position that dates back to the early 1970s, is the official representative of D.C.'s interests in Congress. The delegate, currently Eleanor Holmes Norton, serves on committees and can speak, but not vote, on the House floor. The unpaid positions of U.S. senator and representative were created in the early 1990s to serve as lobbyists for D.C. statehood. Sometimes known as \"shadow\" members, they are not recognized by Congress and don't serve on committees or have speaking or voting rights).\n\nAt the meeting, Metro-DC DSA will consider motions for endorsements to any of these offices. Any local DSA member in good standing in the organization – i.e., having paid dues within the past year – is eligible to propose and vote on endorsements.

Byerly","body":"From a socialist perspective, it was ironical that President Obama announced his nomination of Tom Wheeler as the next FCC chairman on May 1. If confirmed by the Senate, Wheeler is unlikely to administer this complex regulatory agency in the people's interest.\n\nWheeler, a former president of the National Cable Television Association (NCTA) and CEO of Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association (CTIA) and present venture capitalist, has spent his whole life in the corporate world investing money, making money, and channeling money to political ends that benefit big business. *Time* magazine's Sam Gustin echoed Obama's own words in acknowledging that with Wheeler, a former top cable wireless industry lobbyist will now be regulating the very companies he once represented on Capitol Hill.\n\nSince 2004, Wheeler was an executive with DC-based Core Capital Partners, which manages about $350 million. Neither the president nor mainstream media are even shy about revealing Wheeler's unabashed alliance with the rich and powerful.\n\nDavid Corn, writer for the *Nation*, had noted back in March when Wheeler's name first surfaced that the nominee-apparent had quite a few other chits in his favor besides ties to the industry. Wheeler had \"raised a lot of money \\[around $700,000\\] as a campaign bundler for Obama\" during the campaign, Corn said, and he was a \"member in good standing with the Washington establishment.\" The latter refers to the numerous advisory boards (i.e., the Kennedy Center) that Wheeler sits on, and to his skill at wending his way through the DC world. Corn (and others on the Left) have also pointed out that Wheeler's loyalty to the telecom industry is well known, and that Wheeler will \"undoubtedly have a light regulatory touch in all matters.\"\n\nOne of those matters will involve addressing rampant consumer complaints about the growing problem of sudden increases in wireless charges, as companies engage in \"cramming\" unauthorized charges on their customers' bills. Another – and in my own view the underlying structural issue – has to do with the very size and power of telecom companies. The giants – AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile – control the wireless spectrum today that we all (socialists and non-socialists alike) utilize. Blogger Bruce Kushnik noted that the giants have been \"gaming\" the government for years by creating holding companies (i.e., false fronts) to buy up parts of the spectrum set aside for small companies. The practice edges small firms out at auction time and allows the uber-conglomerates (Bob McChesney's word) to expand their dominance. The practice has never been successfully challenged – will Wheeler address it?\n\nMy fears are also that Wheeler will continue the pattern under the two previous FCC chairs – Republican Kevin Martin (a Bush appointee) and the current outgoing chair Julius Genachowski (an Obama appointee) – of stonewalling the Third Circuit Court's rulings in 2003 and 2011 requiring the FCC to address dwindling ownership of broadcast television and radio stations by minorities and women.\n\nWheeler vocalized support for the AT&T/T-Mobile merger, which was ultimately blocked, but it portends his tendencies at a moment when the digital revolution desperately needs someone whose mind, heart and policy making powers are directed toward the communication needs of popular masses.\n\nTelecommunications is both spine and nervous system of global capitalism. The telecom industry (which cuts across all social and economic sectors) is second only to the pharmaceutical industry in the size of its revenues. Socialists would do well to stride boldly into this macro-level domain if they want to gain a clearer understanding of how globalization operates and its human agents behave. Labor struggles are worsening in no small way because those who control the telecom industries are exploiting them directly (by suppressing wages, consolidating jobs and laying people off) and indirectly (by denying working people and their advocates a voice in the corporate media and by refusing to cover labor issues in the news).\n\nIn future issues of the *Washington Socialist*, I will explore and critique some Left efforts to do this, but meanwhile, I encourage us to dive in and seek information so we can engage broader conversation within DSA.","order":1},{"title":"Onscreen","date":"2013-05-31","issue":"June 2013","author":"Daniel C.

As the couple ages, it becomes increasingly clear that they need to live on just one floor. The husband has learned woodworking from his father who was a ship builder in the century before last so the solution seems simple: Build a new house. The husband proceeds with confidence but is surprised by a stop work order by the local government who is in charge of housing permits. The husband knows how to cut wood and prepare it, and is less impressed by a county clerk who only knows good wood when it has a stamp. The situation degenerates and the drama continues.\n\nSome may see the film as a right wing anti-regulation show, but another possibility would be to see that in our lives we do not live in just one time or culture. To be a knowledgeable citizen one needs to realize that there are many generations and sub-cultures among us. Our consciousness needs to span centuries and countries in our ability to relate and understand the past and future. Social democracy has a legacy of studying history and the material reality of life. Most regulations are based on the history of human ignorance or in response to scams. The husband who knows wood working may not have paid attentions to others' failures or society's response to the failures. This lack of insight and the clerk's lack of empathy are part of the human condition and it creates much of this drama.\n\n**Small Screen: \"Continuum\" — Social Comment or Cop 'n chase?**\n\n\"Continuum\" is a TV sci-fi series found on Netflix. It is set in 2077 when the corporations have set aside the illusion of democracy and have become the government. Terrorists \"fighting\" the corporations have gotten themselves sent back to 2012 in an attempt to start a popular movement. The terrorists are chased by a cop, but the plot has so many twists that it is not clear how the series will go. Reviewers seem to be split on whether this is a right-wing or left-wing series. The series does play as a cop show. There are a lot of cool graphics and season two will start on the Sci-Fi Channel later this month.\n\n\"Continuum\" piqued my interest in that it is interesting how popular culture reflects our current reality. Since corporate interests and ignorant billionaires are shaping our government and democratic processes to minimize the public interest and maximize short-term profits, the idea of replacing our government with a corporate council seems closer to reality than most want to believe. The Tea Party and ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council) are pushing and creating bills to dismantle state and local governments and to become wholly owned corporate profit centres. Also note that Democrats and Republicans have structured student loans to be quite profitable for banks but are crippling students' futures. However, social change via terror is, we know, a non-starter. The last season, however, ended with the demise of the worst terrorist. We will have to see if the series trends toward the action of a cop flick or more toward social commentary.","order":2},{"title":"Review: How the Moneyed Classes Have Always Used Debt to Discipline and Punish the Rest of Us","date":"2013-05-31","issue":"June 2013","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"**Robert Kuttner, *Debtor's Prison: The Politics of Austerity versus Possibility.* Alfred A. Knopf, 2013.**\n\nMost books that hope to sell widely do not explicitly promote socialism by name, and Robert Kuttner's latest, *Debtor's Prison*, is no exception.\n\nAs with many other analysts we tend to like, however, Kuttner's development of current conditions and their historical background, and the prescriptions one can draw from them, fulfill one of our (or at least my) definitions of Socialism. That might be formulated as: When people in organized/organizing groups take increasing, and increasingly informed, control of their economic (hence their social and political) conditions of existence, that's socialism moving toward Socialism.\n\nBooks like *Debtor's Prison* should have pride of place in the area defined by that phrase \"increasingly informed.\"\n\nThe main theme of *Debtor's Prison*, per the title, is the role of debt and indebtedness in the history of governance and public provision, and it provides a rich history of how this fulcrum of capitalism – credit extends the money supply and enables growth – turns quickly into a weapon wielded by creditors, one that frequently handcuffs productive activity and reproduces the hegemony of finance.\n\nSince the inception of finance capitalism in the Early Modern West, governments have struggled, sometimes directly, with that problem. Kuttner's detailed history starts with the oft-indebted novelist and journalist Daniel Defoe, who argued that putting debtors in prison stifled the whole economy, putting productivity in effect on ice inside the walls of places like the infamous Marshalsea prison of Dickensian fame. As the 18<sup>th</sup> century began, financial bubbles had put so many merchants in debtors' prisons that the economy was noticably dampened, highlighting Defoe's insight. Queen Anne's advisors and parliament passed the first bankruptcy act in 1705 to remedy that.\n\nBut a dismal pattern was set: The act provided debt relief for major merchants but not for ordinary folk in debt – an early instance of bailing out those \"too big to fail.\"\n\nAt a discussion of his book at the Economic Policy Institute May 16, Kuttner noted that \"moral hazard is a favorite phrase of the immoral financiers.\" Somehow the financiers have had, historically, much better luck than ordinary folk, or even national governments, have in getting debt relief. \"The history of debt relief,\" Kuttner says, \"is one of double standards.\"\n\nIt is that history Kuttner provides – public and private debt (and their conflation and confusion), the generative and destructive role of credit, and the centuries-long struggle for a public policy that will enable economic activity without guaranteeing structural inequality.\n\nThe bright and – unfortunately – exceptional model is the \"middle third of the twentieth century\" when \"\\[c\\]oalitions came to power in the West determined to harness capitalism in the broad public interest.\" (11)\n\nIn that era, many governments achieved what Kuttner in his EPI talk called \"the sweet spot....loose money and tight regulation.\" Elaborating in his book , he said \"Since the inception of modern capitalism, the central challenge of financial policy in a market economy has been to keep capital costs low for the real economy of factories, farms, consumers and entrepreneurs without allowing that same cheap money to promote asset bubbles and other forms of purely speculative windfall gain.\" The \"middle third\" of the last century was exceptional in managing that, but \"\\[m\\]ore often than not, financial policy has failed that challenge.\"\n\nThat critical three decades from the '30s to the '60s saw the West's huge leap and long-boom prosperity as financialism was constrained while the real economy thrived. By Kuttner's account, the conscious deployment of debt forgiveness after World War II – in huge contrast to the punitive and self-destructive framework of the post-World War I settlement – was key to that boom. John Maynard Keynes had been a carping young outsider at Versailles, who went home rather than watch the mess being made by Wilson, Clemenceau, and by Lloyd George's vengeful appointees to a settlement commission. In 1945, Keynes was at the top of his influence, and policies that put off debt service and promoted reconstruction without financialization for victors and vanquished not only carried the day but set the tone for nearly two decades of nearly bubble-free growth.\n\nOne of this book's many virtues, it seems to me, is the focus on solid, detailed history grounding the few successes and spectacular failures that litter this account of financialization' s persistent colonizing and corrupting the \"real economy.\" Time and again, the double standards for debtors and their creditors that began in the 1705 English bankruptcy bill prevail. In the US, common folk and households didn't get a reasonable path out of debt until 1938 (the Chandler Act), which \"introduced for the first time the sort of provision that Daniel Defoe pursued in vain, for the rehabilitation of individual debtors.\" (198)\n\nOne of the critical components of hegemony, of course, is informational differentials – lacking the full picture of oppressive practice in the debt-and-austerity game, individuals are dissuaded from organizing, and individuals, social groups and even nations buy the false narrative that their debt is their moral failing and that the privation of austerity (their austerity) is the only solution and nothing other than what they deserve. Those promoting and enforcing this narrative, somehow, manage to evade austerity themselves. The double standard again applies, reinforced by the cash and cultural power behind the hegemonic narrative.\n\nThe double standards for debt relief extended to the disastrous epoch of the \"Washington Consensus,\" promoted by the World Bank and IMF as their biggest backer, the US, stood at their elbows. Whole nations were told of their unworthiness and guilt. Even as the consensus proved itself worthless time and again, the narrative remained strong.\n\nKuttner's discussion of the obsessive austerity model that prevails in Europe's current crisis scathingly notes the scapegoating of Greece—admittedly something of a bad actor—in the terms that the IMF and World Bank honed for use in African \"rescue\" missions. Portugal, he observes, followed the German-driven austerity consensus prescription to the letter – and still stumbled, wrecking what had been a vibrant economy. (150-151) But we don't hear much about Portugal.\n\nEconomist Jared Bernstein, member of a panel of commentators at a recent book talk at the Institute for Policy Studies, noted that it's important to distinguish \"good debt\" and \"bad debt\" in the discussion. The extension of credit on standard terms for the \"real economy\" would qualify as good, he suggested, and there are parts of Kuttner's account where that distinction is not always made, I would agree. But it's clear that the churn of financialized leverage, chewing its own tail, plays the role of the villain here, as does the persistent effect of the double standard in dumping big-time private debt both onto public and family balance sheets. \"Banks bail, students fail,\" as Kuttner put it. And the book's focus on that persistent effect of financial hegemony, as another commentator, New School economist Teresa Ghilarducci, said, highlights \"the financialization of households.\"\n\nKuttner's attention to the complex history of debt, credit and policy and how they are woven into the fabric of much of what we experience today is extremely rewarding for those who thought they had learned from history through which they had lived – the Asian and South American debt crises, today's European fiasco and the austerity mania of the increasingly fact-free zone we call the Republican Party. As Stephen Colbert has been known to say, \"reality has a liberal bias.\" Again, information matters.\n\nThough Kuttner joins other historians and analysts in increasingly seeing that halcyon \"middle-third\" period of the last century as a rare exception in history, he notes \"one can be heartened by history's intermittent exceptions. They suggest that the hegemony of finance is not an iron law, only a predisposition.\" (11)\n\nBooks like Kuttner's, and other attempts to lift the veil over our economic lives as they are severely constrained by shadowy others, are supremely important as the 21<sup>st</sup> century launches into the unknown. During the 19<sup>th</sup>-century debates over paper money versus hard currency, \"the issues were at least vividly in public contention. By comparison, though the underlying questions are the same enduring ones, the money debates of the early 21<sup>st</sup> century are wrapped in mystification, giving financial elites a free pass.\" (193)\n\nThanks to Kuttner and his fellow veil-lifters, that factor can diminish. In an age suffused with B.S. about overconsumption and guilt, this kind of information matters immensely.\n\n\n\nKuttner's appearance at EPI is on video here.

Many of the programs being gouged are of greatest benefit to low-income people, such as Head Start, food pantries, unemployment benefits, drug treatment centers and rent support, as [former Labor Secretary Robert Reich](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/25/slowmotion-sequester-america-invisible-poor), [writing in the *Guardian*,](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/25/slowmotion-sequester-america-invisible-poor) recently pointed out.\n\nYes, the poor can go hungry or homeless, but when it comes to wealthy folks having to wait a few extra minutes to board their flights, *that's* going too far. When in late April the Federal Aviation Administration announced that, due to the sequester, it would have to furlough air traffic controllers for one day every two weeks– a move that would cause a spike in flight delays – members of Congress responded with immediate outrage. You can take food out of the mouths of babes, but when it comes to making first-class passengers wait an extra hour to board a plane – and when many of those passengers are congresspersons on their weekly visits to their home districts– why, that's just un-American!\n\nWithin a week of the start of furloughs, Congress – acting with almost unprecedented speed and unanimity for a body that frequently can't agree what time of day it is – passed a bill to halt the FAA furloughs. Of the countless clients of federal programs being gouged by the sequester, Congress chose to spare airlines and their passengers. Of course, the airlines lobbied furiously to stop the furloughs, because the prospect of flight delays – and there were thousands of delays that week due to the controller furloughs – would drive away enough of their customers to turn profit into loss. Also, air travel is a form of transportation whose customers tend to be at the higher ends of the income scale – unlike, say, mass transit, which serves many more lower-income users, and of which the federal funding is being slashed with hardly any tears from members of Congress.\n\nAt a time when the most urgent economic priority is creating jobs and stimulating growth, Congress –with Obama's collusion – has instead decided that reducing the federal deficit trumps all other priorities. Such a policy helps cut the tax bills of wealthy Americans with minimal need for government services, but it also acts as a drag on an economy that is far from restoring the millions of jobs lost since the 2008 recession.\n\nPresident Obama signed the FAA bill, but he should have vetoed it while demanding that, rather than play favorites, Congress repeal the entire sequester. That he lacked the guts to do so is no surprise. After all, he acquiesced to the sequester in the first place on the grounds that across-the-board cuts would be so unpalatable that Congress would reach a better deal before they took effect.\n\nWe now can see the bankruptcy of that thinking. The only way out is to build a powerful movement to oppose austerity politics and *force* Congress and the president to adopt an economic policy the benefits the majority of Americans.\n\n*— Bill Mosley*\n\n**\n\n**Privatize the TVA? What is Obama thinking!**\n\nIn mid-May, the Obama administration suggested privatizing the Tennessee Valley Authority as a way of raising revenues to help close the national budget deficit. The TVA, a landmark project of FDR's New Deal, is the largest supplier of electricity in the nation. The facility is located in Tennessee.\n\nThe last time I heard such a proposal, it was from the Republicans a few years back. I remember one Republican being quoted then as asking why the government should own such a large enterprise when it could be creating revenue in the private sector. Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), a free-market Republican, has called Obama's proposal a bad idea that will lead to higher energy rates for his constituents.\n\nOther Republicans are also all over Obama's proposal this time, opposing it for all they are worth. Even Fox News noted the paradox in this exchange of positions by the two parties. But to be sure, Obama probably does not represent all of his party in this one.\n\nThe short-term revenues that any sale of the TVA might bring would pay down only a tiny fraction of the nation's debt. Under its present public ownership, the facility pays for itself, with only periodic needs for small investment to assure needed updates.\n\nThe TVA – and its sister project, the Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest – are excellent examples of [how socialism works in the broad public interest](http://www.alternet.org/economy/shocker-republicans-fight-obama-plan-privatize-hugely-popular-cheap-energy-source-tva?akid=10462.52132.t1oCUH&rd=1&src=newsletter843225&t=17). Both were built during the New Deal era and are administered by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nSince this proposal could be lost on the news radar as the Republicans invent more scandals like the IRS and Benghazi to attract news attention, DSA members should remain vigilant about opportunities for our input and action to save the TVA.\n\n*— Carolyn M. Byerly*\n\n\n\n**Necessary Question for Dems**\n\nThe current dysfunction in government begs for a solution, and one could be more democracy. The Republicans already have their answer, which is the opposite: reducing the number of voters by limiting the franchise, privatizing the government, and pretending to aid immigration. It would seem that the logical Democratic position would be to enhance and spread democratic techniques, such as limiting campaign funding. It may be true that some action will require difficult steps like a constitutional amendment, but why not start the discussion?\n\nOne goal may be to abolish the Electoral College, which would make every state a battleground state and let more than 80 percent of the voters feel that their vote really counted. It would also lessen the influence of money in the campaigns in that the funds would have to be spread over the entire nation, not just a few states. Smaller non-amendment techniques on the state level may include giving every voter a $20 deduction on her or his state income tax and passing laws mandating leave to vote. This would encourage more voter participation.\n\nAlso, why are Democrats not fighting the influence of money in elections? Money is corrosive to democracy in that it limits who can organize a major campaign and facilitates psychological and political games to confuse and sway voters.\n\nOne would think that more democracy would be a good way to differentiate the Democrats from the Republicans, and would be a plus for the Democrats. The current election process has broken down into a game that enhances the role of the moneyed, who can best influence the process. The question I have is: Are we stuck with a broken process because the most financially influential in the Democratic Party do not want to lessen their influence? Are they more concerned about their influence than expanding democracy and having functional government?\n\n*— Daniel C.

It also mostly won't generate new jobs, and it won't improve the lives of future generations.\n\nInstead, Kuttner points out, cutting federal expenditures and federal debt levels today will help prolong the current U.S. economic stagnation that is primarily the result of the 2008 financial crash, which in turn was largely brought on by the mammoth build-up of private debts (both corporate and individual) prior to 2008.\n\nIronically, by prolonging America's post-2008 economic stagnation, a policy of slashing federal spending now would probably deepen the financial problems of Social Security and Medicare (such as they are) by reducing the payroll tax revenues that support both programs.\n\nBy reducing US economic growth rates overall and thus shrinking the\nrevenues the government gains from corporate and individual income taxes, a policy of deficit-cutting in the short term would also have the effect of growing the national debt in the medium-to-long term, while at least temporarily reducing the rate of new job creation.\n\nIn sum, deficit-cutting today, allegedly in the name of future generations, would almost certainly damage the economic prospects of the very same younger Americans who are now being urged to support this policy.\n\nAnd the politics of debt and austerity, GOP style, is likely to be linked to continuing conservative efforts to weaken the federal government's regulatory role in overseeing Wall Street. This means it could set up younger Americans for being hammered once again by yet another major financial crash– sometime in the not-very-distant future.\n\n**The Peter Peterson Connection**\n\nPeter G. Peterson, a former CEO of Goldman Sachs, former U.S. Secretary of Commerce under Nixon, and former chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, is the billionaire investment banker whom many observers view as the linchpin of the pro-austerity, anti-deficit lobby nationwide.\n\nPeterson is a friend of Obama's economic advisor Robert Rubin, Kuttner notes, which probably guarantees him a somewhat sympathetic ear at the White House. He headed the search committee that recommended Tim Geithner, who left office as Treasury Secretary earlier this year, to become head of the Federal Reserve Board of New York back in 2002.\n\nPeterson also is the author of several books – the first dates back to the early 1980s — on the alleged risks of high U.S. government deficits. And to quote Kuttner, he has used his fortune since the early 1990s to bankroll \"a large array of nominally bipartisan organizations warning of fiscal Armageddon.\"\n\n**Schools for Budget Cutters: Is There a 'Clinton Connection,' Too?**\n\nFor example, Kuttner writes, the Obama administration's former director of the Office of Management and the Budget (OMB), Peter Orzag, in 2012 spoke at an event unveiling a new school curriculum on \"Understanding Fiscal Responsibility\" developed by Columbia University's Teacher's College, with more than $2 million in Peterson Foundation funding.\n\nSimilarly, in 2012, the Peterson Foundation sponsored a \"Fiscal Summit\" featuring Bill Clinton as a speaker and presenting proposals from an array of different think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation and even the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, on how the federal deficit might be reduced.\n\nIn 2012, the Peterson Foundation helped to fund an effort by the Clinton Global Initiative to engage college students in thinking about \"fiscal sustainability\" in ways compatible with Peterson's worldview, at least as Kuttner reports it.\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, Bill Clinton at a Clinton Global Initiative summit in June of 2012 hailed a \"commitment\" by PricewaterhouseCoopers (or PwC), the huge corporate accounting firm, to devote some $160 million to the development of a curriculum on financial literacy, to be called \"Earn Your Future,\" to be delivered to some 2.5 million students in grades 3-12 over the next few years.\n\nAlong with funding the \"Earn Your Future\" curriculum, PwC boasts, it mobilized large numbers of PwC employees to participate recently in Martin Luther King, Jr. Day by engaging in volunteer activities \"from teaching financial literacy modules in schools to hosting career exploration programs for youth organizations.\"\n\nPwC's publicity for the \"Earn Your Future\" initiative suggests that the focus will be on improving the personal financial management and financial planning skills of students. However, American progressives may want to monitor PwC's new curriculum as it is released, to determine how much it is promoting a pro-austerity, deficit-hawk approach to educating American students and their teachers..\n\n[http://www.forbes.com/sites/causeintegration/2013/03/12/priceless-volunteers-bring-financial-literacy-to-the-masses/ ](http://www.forbes.com/sites/causeintegration/2013/03/12/priceless-volunteers-bring-financial-literacy-to-the-masses/) <http://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-releases/2012/earn-your-future.jhtml>\n\n**On Moderating the Message:** **A Kinder & Gentler Approach to Deficits?**\n\nFor socialists and other progressives, one possible wild card in the Peterson-inspired campaign for deficit-hawk austerity is provided in a new book by former IMF chief economist Simon Johnson, a Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economist, in collaboration with James Kwak, a former McKinsey & Company corporate consultant and recently a fellow at Harvard Law School's Program on Corporate Governance.\n\nSee the related sidebar, \"Do Deficit Hawks Always Need to be Right-wingers?\" for more on the Johnson & Kwak approach to the deficit and debt question.","order":5},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—June 2013 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"June 2013","order":-1,"date":"2013-05-31","body":"**A *Washington Socialist* report**\n\nOne of the efforts in the House to promote anti-austerity and pro-jobs measures is Rep. John Conyers's HB 1000, \"The Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Training Act.\"It is clearly harking back to the original Humphrey-Hawkins of 1978, which among other things first tasked the Federal Reserve to give roughly equal policy attention to employment and inflation (rather than being obsessed with the latter to the detriment of the former). The bill is funded by a dedicated new tax and devotes two-thirds of revenue to job-creating stimulus projects and one-third to job training.\n\nIt is funded by a tax on financial transactions: 25 cents per $100 in stocks transferred; 2 cents per $100 for \"futures, swaps and credit default swaps,\" the latter having generated the financial collapse we are still enduring. It's understood that this could be a deterrent to \"churn,\" or buying and selling in order to generate commissions for brokers. This tax is one of DSA's national objectives.\n\nA five-page sectional analysis of the bill is [here](http://conyers.house.gov/_cache/files/662eb7f1-f443-4637-8366-0c016b1fbf05/HR%201000%20Section%20by%20Section.pdf).\n\nConyers' office, in order to generate interest and recruit help in adding co-sponsors to the [measure](http://conyers.house.gov/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=66c6ef63-958d-460b-8a47-a4740b407692), has been holding \"Jobs for All\" meetings periodically and DSA local members have attended.\n\n**Andy Feeney** attended and reported on the May 8 meeting. \"...importantly for DSA, it looks as if Conyers is genuinely seeking our support on this bill.

In April, too, there were a flurry of media articles calling for such a tax, following publication of Michael Lewis's new best-selling book *Flash Boys* (see WS book review, this issue).\n\nA Cornell University professor quoted recently in the *New York Times* stated that from a public policy perspective, adoption of a national FTT is \"a no-brainer,\" and on April 8, the *Times* editorial board stated, \"There are several good \\[social justice} arguments for a financial transactions tax ... It would also curb speculation, making the banking system more stable.\"\n\nWhether the response of the liberal-to-progressive media to the Lewis book will make passage of an FTT feasible this year seems doubtful, but in the meantime organizing by the Conyers staff for HR 1000 has been going ahead on its own.\n\nAccording to Jenny Perrino, who as legislative aide to Conyers has spearheaded his office's work on HR 1000, at least 57 members of the House have now signed on as cosponsors of the bill. As of early April, the newest cosponsor was Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), who has now hired Perrino as her chief of staff, a sign that Kaptur, along with Conyers, may make the jobs issue a priority in coming months. A new Conyers staffer, Eric Sperling, will replace Perrino as point person on HR 1000 for Conyers.\n\nConyers aides have now contacted about 100 different organizations to drum up support for the jobs bill, Perrino reported at an April 9 meeting attended by 14 individuals in Conyers' office, as well as others who participated by teleconferencing.\n\nParticipants at the April 9 meeting included representatives of the Gray Panthers, the national Catholic social justice lobby Network, the Gamaliel religious fellowship in Texas, and the AFL-CIO central labor council of Dayton, OH. Also taking part was author D.W. Gibson, of the Not Working Project in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe National Urban League did not have a representative at the meeting, but the Urban League's 2014 State of Black America report is titled *One Nation Unemployed: Jobs Rebuild America.* The report focuses in part on the crisis of unemployment and underemployment among African Americans and other communities of color, and features among other things a commentary by Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore describing initiatives that Baltimore is taking to drive job creation and reduce the gap between the city's haves and have-nots.\n\nProgressive Democrats of America (PDA) is another organization that is helping to promote HR 1000, Perrino stated at the meeting. Still another organization that is interested in the issue is the industry-backed Opportunities Industrial Council (OIC), whose leadership is apparently reasoning that \"business benefits when people are employed,\" as Perrino put it at the meeting.\n\nThe recently created House Employment Caucus will play a key role in promoting HR 1000 going forward, Conyers chief of staff Cynthia Martin said at the April 9 meeting. Martin added, \"We think this bill transcends politics,\" suggesting that it might appeal even to moderate-to-conservative legislators who are concerned about poor people becoming excessively dependent on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits under the TANF or Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program.\n\nConyers seems likely to put some effort into reaching out to business groups in his further efforts to get HR 1000 adopted, judging from what was said at the April 9 meeting. Conyers himself stated at the meeting that federally funded job creation efforts should be in the interests of small businesses, and one of the materials distributed to participants was a printed version of an [*April 9 *](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-conyers/paul-ryan-budget_b_5119536.html)blog op-ed by Conyers that appeared in *The Huffington Post*, stating that even wealthy Americans should reject the harsh pro-austerity budget proposed by the GOP's House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan.\n\n\"Here's a surprise about the Ryan budget: its drastic cuts would be painful even for the nation's wealthiest one percent,\" the *Huffington Post* op-ed said. The piece goes on to state:\n\n\"Successful CEOs understand that America will never be able to compete with China and India on the basis of low wages. Rather, our nation needs to compete on the basis of world-class skills and technical expertise. To do so, we must ensure access to infant nutrition, universal pre-school, well-funded public schools with reasonably sized classes, after-school enrichment programs, and affordable colleges and technical schools.\"\n\nThe Conyers op-ed further argues that wealthy American investors have an interest in rejecting the Ryan budget because Republican-style austerity would reduce the purchasing power of lower-income Americans, at a time when a \"shortage of consumer demand is stifling economic growth, hurting housing market recovery, and denying businesses the customers they need in order to make payroll and turn a profit.\"\n\nThus when the House votes on a budget plan this spring, the editorial concludes, \"the choice is not between serving the rich or the poor. It's a choice between investing in broad-based prosperity and continuing a failed experiment of austerity.\"\n\nTo the extent that democratic socialists continue to support Conyers in his efforts to champion the establishment of a national financial transaction tax to underwrite job creation by state, local and national government, therefore, it may well be that we end up supporting legislation that will be sold under pro-capitalist auspices, and in the supposed self-interest of even the richest \"1 percent.\"\n\nOn the other hand, it is difficult to imagine how Conyers and his staff might hope to get HR 1000 adopted within the reasonably foreseeable future by relying only on the weak and divided U.S. left, especially given the role that big money obviously plays in Washington politics and given the importance of large campaign donors to both major political parties.\n\nComments and printed materials distributed at the April 9 meeting indicate that Conyers and staff will be taking part in a number of events over coming months to promote the \"jobs for all\" agenda. One event tentatively scheduled for May will be a meeting to facilitate the collaboration of the business-backed OIC with the House Employment Caucus.\n\nConyers' office also will be collaborating with the Gamaliel \"Jobs For All Campaign\" as it seeks to influence the revision of three federal workforce regulations in the coming months. These provisions relate to hiring of women and minorities on federal contracts, oversight of apprenticeship programs in the construction industry and the targeting of jobs and job training to low-income people under various Department of Housing and Urban Development programs.\n\nConyers also was scheduled to visit Dayton and Cincinnati in April to build support for HR 1000 among Democratic politicians in Ohio and to visit Pittsburgh in mid-May to promote the legislation in Pennsylvania. A longer-term goal is to prepare an impressive presentation on the jobs bill for the annual Congressional Black Caucus Conference that will take place in the fall.\n\nMetro DC DSA representatives have attended most of the regular meetings on HR 1000 that Conyers has held over the past year and will continue to monitor the progress of organizing around the legislation.\n\n[*DC Local weighs in on net neutrality, cable megamerger*](http://dsadc.org/dc-local-weighs-in-on-net-neutrality-cable-megamerger/)\n\nTuesday, May 13th, 2014\n\n**METRO DC DSA POSITION STATEMENT**\n\n**ON COMCAST-TWC MERGER AND NET NEUTRALITY RULEMAKING**\n\n**Adopted by the Steering Committee of DC-Metro DSA**\n\n**May 10, 2014**\n\nMembers of the DC-Metro chapter of Democratic Socialists of America oppose the proposed merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable (MB Docket No. 14-57). The merger, if allowed, would privilege wealthy cable companies over the interests of a majority of the people in the United States. If merged, the new parent company would control 19 of the largest 20 markets in the nation, something that approximates a monopoly. With that kind of economic power, cable customers would see escalating subscription fees, something that would put access out of reach for those in low-income families. Most low-income families are minorities, a fact that should not be overlooked. Lack of access to cable would also affect access to broadband/Internet services, something that would expand the digital divide between the haves and have-nots. Another aspect in the proposed merger often overlooked is the anticipated layoff of hundreds, perhaps thousands of employees.\n\nWe believe this clear worst-case instance of the effects of corporate consolidation should move the FCC to consider the essential public-utility quality of cable and internet services and declare these entities common carriers, governed by the agency's public-interest mandate and subject to regulation to ensure net neutrality in its full meaning\n\nAs the decision heads toward a vote, we urge Commissioners to remember that the Internet was created and developed largely at taxpayer expense. We believe that this resource, now privatized for profit, should remain widely and fairly available to all in the spirit of public interest.\n\nThis statement was passed at the May 10 membership meeting and posted on the FCC comments section ([*www.fcc.gov/comments*](http://dsadc.org/2014/05/www.fcc.gov/comments)) May 13.\n\n[Good Reads: the May Day edition](http://dsadc.org/good-reads-the-may-day-edition/)\n\n**Good Reads for Socialists in May**\n\nThe Young Democratic Socialists' Red Letter is out with coverage of their February conference: <http://www.ydsusa.org/red_letter_s14>\n\nCities are doing their own thing when it comes to combating inequality – a problem that is getting no traction at the national level.

The infamous Haymarket Square massacre in Chicago, where a bomb killed seven police officers, occurred at one of these rallies. Eight workers were convicted, and some historians, including Howard Zinn, have concluded the bombing was the work of a provocateur who wanted to give police a pretext to arrest leaders of the protest. International Workers' Day is celebrated as the official day of labor in much of the world – but not in the United States where it began. In 1894 Congress, with the support of a few centrist labor organizations, established a \"Labor Day\" in September for the express purpose of avoiding association with the more radical and militant groups who championed May 1 as labor's holiday. So remember to raise a fist and a red banner this May Day. *– Bill Mosley*\n\n\n\n**May Day in Vietnam**\n\n*By David Duhalde*\n\nIn the spring of 2005, I was on the extended vacation experienced by millions of middle-class and wealthier American youth: study abroad. I studied at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and even interned at the *China Labour Bulletin* – an NGO focused on helping mainland workers. This opportunity also allowed me to travel throughout the region. With a Canadian friend, I spent two-weeks in Vietnam including Reunification Day (April 30) and Workers Day (May 1).\n\nSince the mid-1980s, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam had undergone Doi Moi; its own form of capitalist restoration like the People's Republic of China. Vietnam, however, under my observations, had significantly less of an open break with Marxism-Leninism and embracement of consumerism. Unlike in my visits to China, I saw pictures and statues of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. The sections of the country that I saw abstained from blatant corporate advertising. Driving down a country road, instead of billboards for consumer goods there was government propaganda. However, the signs spent less time praising the glories of state socialism and more on AIDS prevention advocacy.\n\nThe timing of my trip coincided with the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the fall of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) on April 30, 1975. Reunification Day and May Day were always back-to-back, but that year saw even larger festivities including a visit by future Cuban President Raul Castro. Castro's attendance meant the cities were filled with Spanish-language banners. With my poor Spanish skills, I read one placard: \"Cuba and Vietnam, Together Shall Overcome.\" What exactly they were overcoming was never specified.\n\nAs May Day drew closer, my curiosity was filled with stock footage of mandatory Soviet May Day parades. I predicted the same still happened in Vietnam. So I dragged my friend to tourist information desks pleading for parade details. At one point trying hand gesturing \"Cuba\" to a confused civil servant, which my travel mate has never let me forget. May 1st came without Stalinist marching. Instead, we found most people enjoying the day off. At night, we looked for dinner and found a restaurant. It appeared to be open, but actually the staff was cooking and eating together. Their solidarity with each other embodied the true spirit of Labor Day in a way no march ever could. Sometimes, the workers of the world have to relax, too.\n\n[*History conference remembers radical group, Science for the People*](http://dsadc.org/history-conference-remembers-radical-group-science-for-the-people/)\n\n***The Washington Socialis*t &lt;&gt; May 2014**\n\n*By Daniel Adkins*\n\nScience for the People (SftP) is a leftist group that was mainly active in the 70s and 80s. It was the topic of a science history conference at University of Massachusetts in Amherst this April. The conference was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation. The conference was a multi-generational meeting with older SftP types, professors, and students.\n\nThe conference detailed the history of SftP. One linage was by elite physicists involved in creating the atomic bomb and other military research. Often scientists were hired for non-nuclear research and later told that their funds were in jeopardy if they could not take on weapons projects too. During the Cold War much of physics research was funded by the U.S. military. Today the sciences have broader support. Sadly some of this funding for mathematicians and physicists is from Wall Street in efforts to rig the stock market for instantaneous profits for the 1% while our long–term sustainability is in jeopardy.\n\nThe other influence for SftP was politicized progressives and lefties in the sciences. There were many SftP chapters including the Helen Keller (a socialist) collective in Boston which published many copies of the magazine. SftP is unique in that it points out how capitalism focuses on profits for the few and subverts the social use of its products. An example is how our farms and food industry are more concerned with selling and creating needs for their products (creating addiction to sugar), then to meeting the need for healthy food products. The food industry also cognitively captures the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to meet the needs of industry which is why some progressive food experts press for the need to move the definition of the national diet from USDA to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) which has a health focus.\n\nThe original SftP group had a reputation of breaking up regular American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) meetings to get their members' voices heard. This may seem crass, but often these meetings were run by defense scientists who were intent on not having their research questioned. In one meeting a defense scientist who was being considered to lead the AAAS, was loudly accused by SftP of crimes of science against the people. The SftP speaker had surrounded himself with activists to avoid being interrupted by the police. This event hit the newspapers.\n\nToday the Department of Defense is still a major employer of scientists, but is not the only major actor. Some corporations try to invent the future making us even more connected, but many just use science as a way to make profits. Capitalism has significantly captured our legislative and the executive branches to feed profits to the businesses as opposed to moving us to a sustainable and healthy future.\n\nWashington is lucky to have the last SftP chapter and this bonus is mainly due to progressive professors and students at Howard University. Some of the issues they focus on are: \\* climate change \\* the militarization of science \\* agricultural science and food justice \\* the scientific construction of race and gender\n\nFor information on Science for the People check out: Science for the People Conference : [*http://science-for-the-people.org*](http://science-for-the-people.org) DC Metro Science for the People: [*http://www.dcmetrosftp.org*](http://www.dcmetrosftp.org) SftP magazines can be found at: [*http://socrates.berkeley.edu/\\~schwrtz/SftP/MagazineArchive/MagTOCs.html*](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/%7Eschwrtz/SftP/MagazineArchive/MagTOCs.html)","order":1},{"title":"Maryland Legislature: Showy, but hard on workers and the poor","date":"2014-05-01","issue":"May 2014","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"A pretty uneventful, rancor-free budget process and the ballyhoo over passage of a minimum wage increase and decriminalization of marijuana in the Maryland General Assembly's 2014 session masked some major disappointments for progressive ideas and forces when the session ended in early April.\n\nThe vaunted minimum wage bill was a priority of Gov. Martin O'Malley. But his proposal was gutted by House committee action by the time it emerged, extending the phase-in period to reach a level of $10.10 per hour to 2018, two years more than originally formulated. Tipped workers were left in the trough they are in now, with a proportional attempt to raise their wages stripped out in the House bill. And a measure to allow the wage to rise further with inflation after 2018 was removed.\n\nBut at least the minimum wage bill passed. The Earned Sick and Safe Leave Act that would have allowed 700,000 uncovered Maryland workers to earn paid sick leave failed for the second year in the Economic Matters Committee of the House, [one of many casualties](http://dsadc.org/an-update-on-marylands-legislature/) of the persistent pro-business, anti-worker bias carefully built into the committee systems of both chambers. Significant numbers of food service workers, for instance, will need to go to work sick in order not to be fired.\n\nA \"Maryland Second Chance Act\" (HB1166) that would have enabled ex-offenders to clear their records for the purpose of seeking employment three years after release failed because House and Senate couldn't agree on their respective amendments, though it was passed by both chambers.\n\nAs noted in a previous *Washington Socialist* article, a bill supported\nby labor leaders and peace activists providing for a Maryland Futures\nCommission that would have planned a post-Pentagon path for the state's workforce was [sideswiped by the leadership](http://dsadc.org/maryland-legislative-roundup-mike-mike-kill-a-bill/), which pre-empted it with a study committee of safe centrists appointed\nby Senate President Mike Miller and House Speaker Mike Busch.\n\nA \"Democracy Amendment\" that would have committed the state to an \"Article V\" constitutional convention of the states with the express purpose of reversing the Citizens United Supreme Court decision came close to passage by the Senate as the Assembly's last night of work April 7 descended to its normal chaos. A dispatch from the activist group [Get Money Out – Maryland](http://www.getmoneyoutmd.org/) reported that Senate President Mike Miller was forced to quash the passage by invoking the specter of a \"runaway convention\" with bad consequences. So \"now we know where our main barrier lies\" for a success in 2015, the group asserted.\n\nThe Assembly rushed to placate business interests and the wealthy by raising the exclusion on the state's estate tax to the federal level. Now an estate must be well over $5 million to be subject to the estate tax, where before estates of $1 million or more fell under the tax. That would allow more large estates to escape paying a fair share and staunch a \"millionaire drain\" apparently perceived by alarmists on the business right – who always have an ear in the Assembly. According to the narrative, the really rich are relocating official residences in other, better states to die. The Assembly's chief financial policy analyst predicted a revenue loss of $80-90 million a year. Suggestions that a better tax relief move would be to cut the regressive sales tax or increase the Earned Income Tax Credit, [noted in the *Baltimore Sun*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-bz-estate-tax-20140130,0,5064698.story?page=1), did not find takers in the Assembly.\n\nSo, for many progressive causes and bills, it is \"wait till next year.\" For the Assembly, it was business as usual.","order":2},{"title":"Michael Lewis's New Expose of Wall Street Predators: Can It Build Support for a US Financial Transaction Tax?","date":"2014-05-01","issue":"May 2014","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"Book Review of *Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt*, by Michael Lewis. W.H. Norton and Company: New York and London (2014). 274 pages, hardcover; $27.95.\n\nThere are two good reasons DSA members may want to read this new financial expose by best-selling author Michael Lewis. The first is that it's an enjoyable read – a journalistic expose of some very convoluted double-dealing in the securities market that reads surprisingly like a good mystery novel. The second reason is that in the roughly four weeks that have passed since its March 31 publication, *Flash Boys* has become politically important.\n\nA flurry of media coverage has relayed to millions of Americans Lewis's conclusion that a small circle of high-tech \"High Frequency Trading\" (HFT) firms has found ways to siphon off hundreds of billions of dollars from U.S. financial markets, and that HFT traders are now gouging more traditional investors ranging from union pension funds to big hedge funds while creating dangerous market instability in the process.\n\nLewis has been interviewed on *60 Minutes*, for example; certain critics of his conclusions and their applicability to small investors have nonetheless thanked him for drawing attention to the risks of HFT traders potentially destabilizing the securities markets; and a reporter in *BloombergNe*ws/*Businessweek* recently noted that a survey of financial industry participants showed that 51 percent now think of HFT trading as a \"serious\" or \"very serious\" problem.\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, new investigations of HFT trading have recently been announced by the FBI and the New York Attorney General's Office. And progressives who have long wanted to curb the excessive growth of U.S. financial markets by enacting a national Financial Transaction Tax (FTT), otherwise known as a \"Tobin Tax\" or \"Robin Hood Tax,\" have seized on *Flash Boys* as evidence that the United States needs a \"flash tax\" to tackle exactly the sort of predatory trading Lewis describes.\n\nWashington D.C.'s *The Hill* recently quoted Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), for example, on an FTT's potential ability to cure some of the problems Lewis portrays. Articles and editorials linking *Flash Boys* and proposals for an FTT also have appeared in *Salon,* the *Guardian,* the AFL-CIO's blog, the *Huffington Post*, the *Christian Science Monitor* and the *New York Times*, although some observers caution that there are still strong headwinds against such a tax, from both Republicans and the Obama White House.\n\nSocialists who support a national FTT therefore may want to give *Flash Boys* a glance, if only to find political ammunition. But a second excellent reason for picking up the book is that Lewis is a talented writer, with an almost novelistic sense of plot and character development, and in *Flash Boys* as in several previous exposes he succeeds in making technical explanations of obscure financial scams surprisingly pleasurable to read – pleasurable, and often very funny.\n\nIn *Flash Boys'* introduction*,* Lewis writes that his idea for the book began when he read of a rather unworldly Russian-born computer programmer, one Sergei Aleynikov, being arrested by the FBI for allegedly stealing from Goldman Sachs, his former employer, a rather small amount of computer code. According to prosecutors, this code, if placed in the wrong hands, could be used to \"manipulate the market in unfair ways.\"\n\nWell, Lewis recalls wondering, if it was dangerous to the markets in the \"wrong\" hands, how safe would it be if it remained with Goldman Sachs?\n\nWith this, Lewis introduces the reader to a brave new world of HFT trading firms that has taken off rapidly in just the last few years. About half of *Flash Boys* describes the ways in which some very smart start-up HFT firms as well as several major investment banks (the banks, however, proving much less adept at HFT than their nimbler small rivals) have discovered how to game an increasingly computerized U.S. securities business for their own enrichment.\n\nIn the process of perfecting HFT trading, Lewis concludes, the \"flash boys\" have quietly skimmed off hundreds of billions of dollars – no one knows exactly how much – from traditional institutional investors. The investors victimized, for example, have included large hedge funds, traditional union pension funds and such commercial money managers as T. Rowe Price, Charles Schwab and Janus Capital.\n\nThe book's second half, more or less, offers Lewis's account of how a peculiar collection of financial industry misfits gradually puzzled out the ways in which the HFT world was being gamed. We then learn how these reformers have apparently invented an effective strategy – effective for now, anyway — to shield more traditional investors from the predators. But whether the fix for investors is extensive enough to shield securities markets from the larger, potentially destabilizing activities of HFT traders is a question now worrying some financial analysts, and Lewis's gnomic last chapter expresses quiet skepticism over whether any fix can be final in an ever-evolving financial world where rampant greed intersects routinely with high technology.\n\nCentral to Lewis's story is an account of how apparently well-intentioned financial regulations have combined with advanced computer technology and high-speed fiber optics to transform U.S. stock markets since 1987. It was in 1987 that an unexpected glitch in the New York Stock Exchange caused a sudden, one-day drop of roughly 33 percent in the average values of securities traded, although the financial markets then recovered almost instantly afterwards.\n\nBecause of the misbehavior of certain individual brokers during in the 1987 mini-crash – some simply stopped taking phone calls, leaving terrified clients unable to respond to the news – U.S. financial regulators passed new rules requiring most securities trading in the future to be done automatically, via computer.\n\nThus while many Americans still think of the stock market as occurring in the New York Stock Exchange building on Wall Street, Lewis notes that today's trading is mostly done without face-to-face human interaction, by computer, over 13 separate electronic exchanges located on big servers in northern New Jersey. A separate computerized exchange services the futures market in Chicago, which is an important but ancillary story to the main tale Lewis tells.\n\nOver the years since 1987, Lewis notes, a series of added regulations, culminating in a 2005 rule called Regulation National Market System or \"Reg NMS,\" have attempted to keep computerized investment firms from cheating their own customers by requiring the traders to seek out the very best market prices for any given customer in any given buy or sell transaction.\n\nUnfortunately, the ironic result of Reg NMS, combined with high-speed computers and the fragmentation of the securities market into separate markets, is that today, trading firms that can conduct their business just a few microseconds faster than other investors can now prey on their more traditional rivals, especially the bigger ones, through \"front running.\"\n\nThanks to Reg NMS, a large traditional investor like a pension fund or an investment bank, when it buys or sells a large block of stock – say, one involving hundreds of thousands of shares – legally must first survey the 13 different exchanges to find which offers the very best price.\n\nHowever, the differing speeds of the computer algorithms in different trading firms, plus seemingly trivial differences in the efficiency and lengths of the fiber optic cables carrying orders to the different New Jersey exchanges, inevitably ensures that trading orders arrive at different exchanges at very slightly different times.\n\nA smart, predatory high-speed trader with faster processing times than everyone else thus can determine, from monitoring the fastest exchange in the system, just what stock a big traditional investor is hoping to trade at a given time of day, and at what price range. The HFT predator then offers to buy or sell the security in question at a slightly higher or lower price than that originally offered by the market, and trades it nanoseconds later with the traditional investor – at a tiny profit per share for the HFT trader, and a tiny loss per share for the traditional investor. Yet those tiny profits and losses per share amount to billions of dollars in revenues over time, due to the enormous volume of transactions happening annually.\n\nAs Lewis puts it, the net effect of the new world that Reg NMS, the fiber optics revolution and HFT traders have together created is to guarantee that since 2007, about 70 percent of all securities transactions in the United States have recently taken place through the functional equivalent of an imaginary intermediary firm, one that we could call \"Scalpers, Inc.\"\n\n\"Scalpers, Inc.,\" as Lewis portrays it, interposes itself between potential buyers and sellers in each trade, forcing both to accept slightly worse prices than they might otherwise enjoy by trading directly. By placing itself between buyers and sellers, Scalpers, Inc. also multiplies the number of trades occurring in securities markets – according to industry statistics, more than 50 percent of all transactions in these markets have recently been conducted by HFT firms. Moreover, the HFT traders inside Scalpers, Inc. have powerful incentives both for fragmenting securities markets into more and more sub-markets, and for working to create more volatility – more price swings – in markets, since it's largely by exploiting price swings and market fragmentation that the HFT firms make money.\n\nPartly to protect themselves against HFT traders, Lewis notes, traditional investment banks have found regulatory loopholes allowing them to do much of their trading in so-called \"dark pools\" within their own institutions. Recently, about 30 percent of securities transactions in the U.S. have occurred inside these dark pools, where transactions are opaque to the outside world – and in theory to HFT traders, but also to financial regulators and the banks' clients. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that a bank will not exploit customers in its dark pool for its own gain, nor that it will never sell access to its pool to HFT predators, if they offer enough money. The dark pools thus offer little protection to investors against being scalped.\n\nThe hopelessly nerdy Sergei Aleynikov, Lewis concludes, was considered dangerous by Goldman Sachs because he had spent two years inside the firm devising programs to speed up Goldman's outdated computer system, basically so Goldman could increase its trading speeds compared to its smaller HFT rivals. Essentially, Aleynikov had helped Goldman in an attempt to become a HFT trading firm itself – although in the long run, Lewis believes, Goldman's management has deemed this impossible, and has apparently left the business.\n\nAs Lewis portrays him, Aleynikov was truly fascinated by the programming challenge involved in speeding up Goldman's trading system and amazingly uninterested in what his employer might do with it. The whole business of trading securities for profit was just a form of gambling, Aleynikov apparently thought, and not worth serious attention. But writing good computer code was fun, creative, and even potentially good for the world, so Aleynikov focused on it while observing the mere money-making activities of his Goldman colleagues with bemusement.\n\nWhen he was convicted and briefly imprisoned for his alleged theft of code that he himself had created from open-source software found on the Internet, Aleynikov was an odd enough character to consider his time in jail a valuable experience, although he was willing enough to leave the place once his conviction was thrown out on appeal.\n\n*Lewis's* description of Aleynikov's idealistic personality and his genial alienation from the competitive, financially driven characters around him offers one of several novelistic pleasures to be found in *Flash Boys*, one even readers with little grasp of Wall Street can appreciate.\n\nThere are many other quirky personalities explored in in *Flash Boys* as well. In this book, just as he did in *The Big Short*, a funny yet horrifying look at the financial follies preceding the 2007-2008 crash in the securitized mortgages market, Lewis structures his exploration of a complex financial reality by examining it through the shifting viewpoints of succeeding major and minor characters, each with a peculiar — and hence interesting – personality and background.\n\nWhat could have been a dry lecture about basically incomprehensible flows of money and technology thus acquires a human face, indeed a series of them, and readers are likely to come away from Lewis's mosaic portrait of HFT trading with affection for many of the characters portrayed, possibly including some of the villains.\n\nAt the end of *Flash Boys*, an eccentric posse of reformers led by Brad Katsuyama, a former trader with the Royal Bank of Canada, has apparently invented a new way of doing securities trading that can block the HFT predators and free traditional investors from their baleful power. No less a Wall Street icon than Goldman Sachs itself appears to be backing the reformers' invention, which is also embraced by many other big names on Wall Street, including some hedge funds that have rarely been accused of financial altruism in the past. Thus *Flash Boys*, unlike some other Lewis exposes, ends with the good guys winning – again, for now.\n\nFrom a Marxist and a socialist perspective, there is a certain amount of pure nonsense to be found in *Flash Boys,* which may be why many mainstream media like it. For example, Lewis at one point suggests that \"front ending\" by high-frequency traders, by skimming off billions in profits from the securities business, has the bad effect of reducing the flow of investors' dollars into productive investments in the real economy.\n\nAs leftist financial writer Doug Henwood wrote in *Wall Street* (1987) and as other financial analysts also point out, this is at best debatable. Except for investments in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), most trading of stocks and bonds in our economy is merely secondary trade in already-issued securities. It does nothing directly to place capital in productive, real-world enterprises that can use the money to employ workers and use up natural resources while producing actual commodities. Instead, trading in the secondary markets mostly makes different traders richer or poorer.\n\nAdmittedly, improved stock prices can make it easier for a popular company to borrow capital for expansion, which does affect the real world, and swings in prices can be a big factor in the long-term health of a union pension fund or commercial investment firm handling middle class 401-K accounts. But the money the HFT traders have been taking from large hedge fund managers, say, is probably not being diverted from the Main Street economy very much.\n\nIn an early passage of the book, Lewis also paraphrases Katsuyama to the effect that \"the U.S. Stock market was now a class system, rooted in speed, of haves and have-nots.\" That seems reasonable in light of Lewis's general theme, but he then adds: \"What had once been the world's most public, most democratic, financial market had become, in spirit, something more like a private viewing of a stolen work of art.\" Given what Lewis himself has written about Wall Street in earlier books, calling it \"the world's most public, most democratic financial market\" is just silly. And Lewis himself seems to contradict this statement soon afterward in his saga.\n\nElsewhere in *Flash Boys,* Lewis offers some sharp, disturbing insights about the disruptive effects of new technology, not only on older Americans and poor children on the wrong side of the digital divide, but even on some of capitalism's elites.\n\nThus one of the more profane members of Katsuyama's reform team, an Irish-born technology manager named Ronan who bristles at being condescended to by arrogant traders who make fortunes by relying on his work, says of his former colleagues: \"I realized very quickly, and they'll admit this, so I mean no disrespect, that they had no fucking clue what they were doing.\"\n\nWhat was true of most securities traders in 2010, Lewis writes, also was true of most officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission when first informed about HFT. To quote Lewis, when HFT trading was becoming common, \"stock market regulators did not possess the information they needed to understand the stock markets.\" Similarly clueless about HFT trading were high-level executives at some 500 major investment firms, overseeing the investing of trillions of dolllars, whom Katsuyama's team had contacted by the end of 2010.\n\nIn a sense, *Flash Boys* illustrates a phrase popularized by Nobel-prize-winning liberal economist Joseph Stiglitz, whose main professional contribution has been to explain how free markets are regularly distorted by \"asymmetric information.\" Clearly, rapid technological change in computers and fiber optics has produced a new problem of \"asymmetric information\" in the securities markets, and the HFT predators can scalp older, slower, more traditional traders by exploiting it.\n\nAn older phrase familiar to Marx, and before him to the great capitalist economist Adam Smith, further suggests that Stiglitz's problem of \"asymmetric information\" is automatically being generated today by Smith's famous \"division of labor in society.\" Arguably, the division of labor and specialized skills that make capitalism technologically great also have generated a world in which brilliant but narrowly focused computer technologists, fiber optics designers and Wall Street traders simply don't understand each other. In this world, even billionaire hedge fund managers can be flummoxed by what futurist writer Alvin Toffler, a former Marxist, has christened \"Future Shock.\" Many of the rest of us are even more defenseless.\n\nLewis writes a good deal about future shock in *Flash Boys,* often without seeming to, and also offers deft but stinging insights into other features of today's financial markets. Whether the barbs hidden in Lewis's brisk prose and fascinating character studies will trigger any meaningful reforms is undoubtedly too soon to tell.","order":3},{"title":"Net Neutrality and the Ordinary Folks","date":"2014-05-01","issue":"May 2014","author":"Carolyn M. Byerly","body":"All the progressive players are now proclaiming the \"death of the Internet\" and \"the end of net neutrality\" ([*http://truth-out.org/news/item/23300-is-the-fcc-poised-to-destroy-net-neutrality*](http://truth-out.org/news/item/23300-is-the-fcc-poised-to-destroy-net-neutrality)). Even the Gray Lady, the *New York Times* ([*http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/technology/fcc-new-net-neutrality-rules.html?\\_r=0*](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/technology/fcc-new-net-neutrality-rules.html?_r=0)), ran a leading front-page story in late April questioning whether FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's public statements favoring higher pricing to some customers (like Netflix) by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like AT&T and Verizon would be the death knell for net neutrality.\n\nThis \"fast lane\" policy would allow the wealthier ISPs to pass the cost along to customers. Those who can pay the most, get the faster service. Also not to be missed in this controversy is that smaller ISPs, which provide Internet access to millions of community based organizations and ordinary people, would be reduced to the \"slow lanes,\" i.e., slower service. Those less well-heeled customers who now subscribe to one of the uber-corporations (as media critic and scholar Bob McChesney calls them) could find it hard to pay higher fees. DSA's national office, individual DSA members, and other ordinary folks could be affected.\n\nThis (less competition, more control over the Internet), is course, is what the few big ubers want. A fast-lane policy would squeeze the smaller players out of the market by enticing their customers (who can afford higher monthly fees) to go with the more expensive options offered through Verizon, AT&T or Comcast.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ([*www.fcc.gov*](http://www.fcc.gov)) has tilted increasingly toward corporate interests since the 1980s under Ronald Reagan. Neoliberal pro-market philosophies that guided communications policies under both Republican and Democrat presidents and Congress since then, have given us a highly concentrated media industry in the USA. It was telecom industry lawyers in the mid-1990s who wrote the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the stealth legislation that was passed by both houses of Congress and sent President Clinton for signature without any publicity or a single public hearing. That legislation, which deregulated the telecommunications industry, has been the Bible of neoliberal policy making by the FCC in the years since.\n\nThe Times quoted Todd O'Boyle of Common Cause's Media and Democracy Reform Initiative saying, \"If it goes forward, this capitulation will represent Washington at its worst.\" He also raised one of the hidden effects of such a policy, observing, \"Americans were promised, and deserve, an Internet that is free of toll roads, fast lanes and censorship — corporate or governmental.\" O'Boyle referred to such a policy as one of \"betrayal\" to Americans, something that fairly condemns the behavior of an agency that exists to assure that media systems operate \"in the public interest, necessity and convenience,\" according to law.\n\nThe FCC has yet not acted on the matter of \"fast lane\" policy for Internet companies, so the public can still get a word in to oppose it. And, flooding the FCC with even short statements from individuals and groups just might have an effect, something seen recently when a flood of opposition to the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger apparently turned the tide of proposed FCC policymaking.\n\nAt this writing, the FCC had received 506 comments on net neutrality, most of them a single short statement.

Newman, a Russian Jewish immigrant, herself had recently worked at that very factory. Without formal education, she taught herself to read and then taught others, joined the Socialist Party, became an advocate for women's rights, and an organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. A century earlier, Shelley, his wife Mary Shelley, and their friend Lord Byron, following on the influence of (Mary's parents) radicals William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft – author of the *Vindication of the Rights of Women* – acted on a revolutionary definition of democracy that celebrated the French revolution, embraced fighters for Irish freedom, feminism, workers rights. They sought a way of living that combined personal independence, commitment to social justice, and an unending search for beauty and meaning in daily life. Those same goals Newman, her fellow workers, her fellow comrades, sought in a struggle that embraced hope even when all seemed hopeless.\n\nMichael Demson and Summer McClinton wrote and drew *Masks of Anarchy*, a graphic novel that interweaves the story of Shelley and Newman. The book tells of a poem written in response to violence and poverty in a society ruled by greed and read nearly a hundred years later as an outcry against the continuing brutalities inherent in a another society ruled\nby the power of greed. Poetry as an expression of love of life and a cry\nagainst oppression has as much meaning in this century, as in centuries gone by.\n\n**III**\n\nProof of that statement was in evidence March 27-30, for the spirit that moved Shelley, Newman and others was visible, audible, during Washington DC's fourth bi-annual Split This Rock Poetry Festival. Born in 2008, when Poets Against the War marked the anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq with public readings of \"Provocation and Witness\" which brought together voices demanding an end to the violence and oppression that mark so much of our country's policies abroad, our practices within. This year's event drew over 600 people to workshops and public readings that sought to continue dialogue and engagement – engagement including a \"group poem of protest\" in front of the White House denouncing government spying and surveillance.\n\nSplit this Rock's call for repeal of the PATRIOT act and the 2008 amendments to FISA that have permitted unfettered government abuse of civil liberties reflects the festival's values. Government intrusion into private lives, government infiltration into organizations engaging in public protest, contributes to a state of fear that induces silence. It is that silence which builds walls between segments of society, that undermines empathy and personal freedom, that allows social injustice and oppressive interpersonal relations to exist unchallenged. And it is that silence which poetry, poetry of engagement and imagination challenges. In the words of the late Adrienne Rich (amongst those writers honored during the festival) \"Poetry is always being created anew, in new places by unforetold hands and voices. In this it is like the many movements against demoralizing power. We don't know where either will come from. This is a story without an end.\"\n\n**IV**\n\nAt the heart of the festival were over 50 workshops, which engaged in discussions of activism, of gender, of race, of history, of understanding space and movement; poetry serving as a medium of expression and as a means to communicate across borders that powerful, if often invisible, walls normally make unbreakable. Telling of the achievement behind that is that panelists and participants in those workshops brought together urban youth from DC's high schools whose writings challenge conditions of life too often taken for granted, with academic poets working in university settings who often speak to the discomfort that lies behind the lives of those who appear comfortable. Poets from rural settings, from immigrant backgrounds, of different ages and different belief systems, combined to produce a mosaic of people far richer than many cultural – or political – events are generally able to attract.\n\nWorkshop titles give a measure of the richness of the program: \"How Political Engagement Affects the Writing Process,\" \"Women Write Resistance: Poets Resist Gender Violence,\" \"Gathering Forces: A Living Anthology of Black LGBTQ Poetry,\" \"Voices from the Latino Heartland: A Reading of Identity & Displacement by the Latino Writers Collective,\" Poetic Strategies for Change,\" \"March to Equality: How Poetry Can Connect Youth to History,\" \"Poetry and the New Black Masculinity,\" – and many more. Listing these only touches upon the range of topics discussed for key to them all was encouraging those sitting and listening to not just take-in, but to speak and give back. They provided a change to think through what Tim Seibles suggested when he wrote:\n\nAmong *the brothaz*, a certain\n\ngrip in the eyes. A sense\n\nof something\n\nSwallowed not chewed –\n\nas if they'd been made\n\na story and were dying\n\nto untell themselves: profiles – prisons,\n\nthe sports inside The Sport.\n\nOutside, the wolf\n\nWith a\n\nhuff and a puff.\n\n–/–\n\nCulture: a kind of knife:\n\ncuts one way opens\n\nyour brain to a certain\n\nbreed of light shaves\n\nconsciousness to its\n\npurpose, its cross: the nail\n\nthru your hand &gt;&lt; your\n\nother hand holding\n\nthe hammer.\n\n**V**\n\nAs those lines should indicate, if the workshops were the heart of the festival, the readings were the soul. Seibles was amongst those who gave readings, so too was Dunya Mikhail — the following stanzas (19-24) of this Arab-American poet of today relating a reality that one can imagine Pauline Newman of old understanding:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFar away from home –\n\nthat's all that changed in us.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nCinderella left her slipper in Iraq\n\nalong with the smell of cardamom\n\nwafting from the teapot,\n\nand that huge flower,\n\nIts mouth gaping like death.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nInstant messages\n\nignite revolutions.\n\nThey spark new lives\n\nwaiting for a country to download,\n\na land that's little more\n\nthan a handful of dust\n\nwhen faced with these words:\n\n\"There are no results that match your search.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe dog's excitement\n\nas she brings the stick to her owner\n\nis the moment of opening the letter.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe cross borders lightly\n\nlike clouds.\n\nNothing carriers us,\n\nbut as we move on\n\nwe carry rain\n\nand an accent\n\nand a memory\n\nof another place.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nHow thrilling to appear in his eyes.\n\nShe can't understand what he's saying:\n\nshe's too busy chewing his voice.\n\nShe looks at the mouth she'll never kiss,\n\nat the shoulder she'll never cry on,\n\nat the hand she'll never hold,\n\nand at the ground where their shadows meet.\n\nAltogether, five free poetry readings were presented during Split this Rock, each at the National Geographic auditorium, in addition to two later night open mic sessions as Busboys and Poets. Each began with a recording of a poet who had passed away in the preceding year followed\nby a DC Youth Slam Team member reading from his or her own work. After\nthat three or four published poets, of different backgrounds and styles, would read – some deeply emotional, analytical, challenging, in Shelley's sense, heart and brain.\n\nToo often formal writing separates the search for self and for individual meaning, separates out incisive observations on the everyday, from any thought of the social context in which those observations are made – as though personal heartbreak or joy, as though intimate observation, can somehow have meaning when abstracted from the world of work, pain, hatred, war in which our individual lives take place. And, one can add, too often activists, engaged in struggles for peace and justice, neglect to take the time to reflect back on the intimate and the introspective; pretending that these are unconnected with a life of engagement. To the contrary, political action and cultural awareness ought to be critical and self-critical, touching on what is directly in front of our eyes as well as on what is known even when not seen.\n\nTrue empathy and solidarity cannot take place without self-knowledge, just as self-knowledge is emptied on content is conceived as taking place in isolation from the lives of others. The readings, as the workshops, made those two as one, the poetry of speech, alternately angry and loving, emotional and thoughtful, opened a window on the poetry of life. Another of the poets reading during the festival, Joy Harjo, expressed that sentiment:\n\nI don't know exactly where I'm going; I only know where I've been,\n\nI want to tell the man who sifted through the wreck to find us here\n\nIn the blues shack of disappeared history –\n\nI feel the weight of his heart against my cheek.\n\nHis hand is on my back pulling me to him in the dark, to a place\n\nNo soldiers can reach.\n\nI hear the whoop-cries of warriors calling fire for a stand\n\nAgainst the brutality of forgetfulness —\n\nEverybody has a heartache –\n\nWe will all find our way, no matter fire leaping through holes in\n\nJump time,\n\nNo matter earthquake, or the breaking of love spilling over the\n\ndreck of matter\n\nIn the ether, stacking one burden\n\nAgainst the other –\n\nWe have a heartache.\n\n**VI**\n\nIt is that recognition that returns us to Pauline Newman's story, for she found herself ground down by a life of poverty, by a world of anti-Semitism, by the mistreatment of women who were treated as below men not only by society at large, but also within the Jewish community, in the trade union and socialist movement – a status she, and others, challenged. Her first activism was, while still a teenager working in the garment trade, organizing a rent strike amongst the other slum dwellers. That fight gave her the courage to seek an education within the male-dominated workers' reading library she discovered in New York. Each step was a part and parcel of breaking through to a wider world, opening up doors that had been closed.\n\nIt is that struggle to open up doors, not just to a few, but to all, which connects her activism with the struggles of today. The rate of illiteracy is growing in the United States, a growth particularly high here in Metropolitan Washington DC – a fact that should be shameful, though apparently many of those dictating public policy are beyond shame. And so too, rates of inequality, of poverty amidst plenty, of hunger, of ill-paid work or of no work, are all growing in our nation's capital and beyond. It is little wonder that in such circumstances, violence grows. Realities such as these make freedom something ever-harder to find in life. After defining slavery, Shelley goes on to describe the freedom he means – it is a freedom he describes to which we still aspire, for which we still need to struggle:\n\nWhat art thou, Freedom? O! could slaves\n\nAnswer from their living graves\n\nThis demand – tyrants would flee\n\nLike a dream's imagery. ...\n\nFor the Laborer thou art bread\n\nAnd a comely table spread\n\nFrom his daily labour come\n\nIn a neat and happy home.\n\nThou art clothes, and fire, and food\n\nFor the trampled multitude ...\n\nThou art Justice –ne'er for gold\n\nMay they righteous laws be sold ...\n\nThou art Wisdom – Freeman never\n\nDream that God will damn forever\n\nAll who think those things untrue\n\nOf which Priests make such ado.\n\nThou art Peace – never by thee\n\nWould blood and treasure wasted be\n\nAs tyrants wasted them, when all\n\nLeagues to quench thy flame in Gaul.\n\nScience, Poetry and Thought\n\nAre thy lamps; they make the lot\n\nOf the dwellers in a cot\n\nSo serene, they curse it not.\n\nSpirit, Patience, Gentleness,\n\nAll that can adorn and bless\n\nArt thou – let deeds, not words, express\n\nThine exceeding loveliness\n\n**VII**\n\nSplit this Rock's name comes from a Langston Hughes poem – Hughes' poetry and prose, his political activism, all expressing an opposition to racism and injustice by calling upon the our country to live up to its proclaimed ideals. poetry and political activism. The anger of Hughes' poems is built on a recognition of a promise broken and of hope of renewal. Poetry – just as social justice activism – is premised on our ability to communicate, on people interacting, listening, learning, and thereby acting. No organizing is possible otherwise – in fact, the mutual support and solidarity inherent in the vision of socialist activism is premised on such an understanding.\n\nYet our continuing inability to realize our promise as a society is the reason why poems of old speak so forcefully to the present.

A decision on the merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable is coming up, sooner than we think, and the evidence is that the deciders, the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department antitrust division, have been captured for years by the [*lobbying efforts*](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/business/media/comcasts-real-repairman.html) of the big players.\n\nThis is big business news, and [*decent articles*](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/business/media/questions-for-comcast-as-it-looks-to-grow.html) about the stakes involved and the lobbying power being brought to bear on the regulators and their Congressional paymasters have been forthcoming<span id=\"_msoanchor_1\" class=\"anchor\"></span>*\\]*. A companion piece by Carolyn Byerly in this issue focuses on the FCC's vulnerability to the age of supercapital.\n\nThe grim details, including the unusual situation of a cable industry that is resigned to losing TV customers and hustling hard to control the Internet connections that will supplant TV, are best laid out in Susan Crawford's *Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.* (Yale University Press2013).\n\nCrawford, a communications law professor at Harvard and Yeshiva/Cardozo, has wisely been promoting her book<span id=\"_msoanchor_3\" class=\"anchor\"></span>with the likes of Bill Moyers and NPR, because (as she told Moyers) \"The solution is for people to care about this issue, ask hard questions at every debate.,..\" Because this continues to be a [*business-section story*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/netflix-lays-out-opposition-to-comcast-time-warner-cable-merger-in-shareholder-letter/2014/04/21/7552190a-c9a2-11e3-a75e-463587891b57_story.html), public awareness is of course far below the threshold needed to react to the genuine crisis here.\n\nCrisis? What crisis? Well, the lax regulatory scheme and the industry's highly skilled massaging of all the players concerned have brought poor quality Internet provision, well below the emerging world standard of fiber-optic delivery, at a price so much higher than the global average that large numbers of people in the US can't afford access. In *Captive Audience* Crawford summarizes:\n\n> \"...the result is expensive, second-rate, carefully curated wired > services for the rich, provided by Comcast and Time Warner; expensive, > third-rate, carefully curated wireless services (or no services at > all) for those who cannot afford a wire; close cooperation among the > incumbent providers of wired and wireless services, and no public > commitment to the advanced communications networks the rest of the > developed world is adopting.\"\n\n\"Curated,\" we should note, has a particularly ominous meaning in Crawford's analysis, referring to the lock on large amounts of media content that Comcast acquired in its last big merger coup, the scooping up of NBC-Universal in 2010 that is the central subject of her book. Control of content – especially live sports, which will be at the core of the live events that may keep TV and cable alive – gave Comcast two ways to block competitors, who would have to build infrastructure and create or purchase content anytime they wanted to take on the giant that already had in place. Conversely, Comcast/Time Warner Cable would have the wherewithal to crush smaller cable companies and preemptively force a merger or sale if this merger comes to pass.\n\nAnd massive control of content would allow the new cable megacorp to torment the customer with premium bundles of a variety of prices – all of them high, and getting higher. Comcast's lobbyists promise a lot of things – but they are careful not to promise that their prices won't go higher.\n\nIf the Comcast-Time Warner merger is approved, the two cable companies will dominate/control 19 out of the 20 major urban markets, 40 percent of all broadband customers and 30 percent of cable customers nationally. And they have cut a deal with Verizon and AT&T to leave the wireless to them. The phone companies have stopped upgrading their copper wire to fiber-optic and set their caps for wireless supremacy; the landline is on the way out.\n\nAn important factor is that in the geographic markets Comcast/Time Warner will control, they don't need to extend their infrastructure to include lower-income neighborhoods. Comcast, which started in Mississippi, does not have a record of serving poor customers – they wired the better-off parts of their franchise territory and made big money charging high prices for service. Volume was not part of their equation, not when the poor were concerned. Millions of people are not \"passed\" by cable and can't get hooked up if they want to. The FCC, which is charged with weighing the public good in such mergers, has the capacity to extract concessions such as more service to the low-income and rural people who increasingly need Internet access to get and keep jobs. But the FCC's recent record on considering public need is as dismal as Comcast's, in large part because they have been out-lawyered and their congressional overseers massaged with campaign dollars.\n\nCrawford's focus is on the potential for national revitalization that is inherent in the Internet, not so much on the declining fortunes of cable TV. Falling behind the rest of the world in reliable, reasonably priced access to a technological wave that was developed on the US taxpayer's dime infuriates her. She tells Moyers\n\n> Parents around the country know that their kids can't get an adequate > education without internet access. You can't apply for a job these > days without going online. You can't get access to government benefits > adequately, you can't start a business. This feels to 300 million > Americans like a utility, like something that's just essential for > life. And the issue of how it's controlled and how expensive it is and > how few Americans actually sign up for it is not really on the radar > screen.\n\nThe notion that the Internet is a utility lies at the heart of questions like \"net neutrality\" and concerns about the \"digital divide\" that grows between those with Internet access and those priced out or in the wrong neighborhood. It also, if applied vigorously by the FCC, would allow for much stricter regulation of Comcast, and reclassification of the cable/broadband infrastructure as a \"common carrier.\" If Comcast had been recognized as the \"common carrier\" it is (like the erstwhile phone companies) the purchase of NBC-Universal would have been disallowed by both FCC and Justice as an impermissible mix of control over infrastructure and content.\n\nCrawford, like many consumer advocates and communications NGOs, argues that the US is missing the boat and needs to re-engage in \"industrial policy\" that will put a priority on the widest possible public access to this latest and most versatile form of communication. Other nations are taking those steps and providing faster Internet at much lower costs. Crawford wrote in a Bloomberg View op-ed that \"It's time to recognize that industrial policy — true leadership, the kinds of initiatives that brought us the federal highway system and national electrification — is called for.\"\n\nIn a detailed example, she shows how many small cities are creating their own broadband networks to advantage their citizens and businesses. Every attempt, though, is assaulted with litigation by the associated cable and Internet providers (a trade group helmed by Michael Powell, Colin Powell's son and a former, quite conservative, chairman of the FCC under George W. Bush). Lafayette, Louisiana, for instance, had to scuffle for nearly a decade to beat the legions of lawyers from the corporations and create their broadband network. About 20 states have passed ALEC-inspired laws forbidding or impeding their municipalities from going their own way on this.\n\n> \"Instead of ensuring that everyone in America can compete in a global > economy, instead of narrowing the divide between rich and poor, > instead of supporting competitive free markets for American inventions > that use information, instead that is of ensuring that America will > lead the world in the U.S. in the information age, U.S. politicians > have chosen to keep Comcast and its fellow giants happy,\"Crawford > writes in *Captive Audience*.\n\nThe communications law professor Tim Wu pointed out in *The New Yorker* that cable providers can furnish broadband (of the slower sort they offer) over their coaxial cables for about $5 a month; the $40 or so they charge gives them a high margin indeed. At those margins, why would they feel an incentive to upgrade their sorry infrastructure for better or wider service? \"Without the intervention of the government there's no reason for these guys to charge us anything reasonable or to make sure that everybody has services,\" Crawford said on the Moyers show.\n\nCrawford's book is written for popular consumption and to agitate response to the relentless march of the telecoms. It is, however, scholarly in the distance it goes into the weeds. Often this is valuable; the jaw-dropping detail of Comcast's lobbying, with promises made and gifts given to critical constituencies like minority organizations and consumer groups, is well laid out here. The ins and outs of antitrust law and its evasion by magnates from John D. Rockefeller to Brian Roberts, Comcast's affable CEO, can get taffy-like, however.\n\nBut socialists will recognize the skill with which Comcast and other major capitalist enterprises weave a web of inevitability out of their increasing command of what is purported to be a competitive market; regulatory agencies, politicians of both capitalist parties and organized groups are all swept into the fabric of oligarchy. Crawford's book and some enterprising journalism make it clear that there are big stakes for the US in managing the outcome of the latest merger attempt, either turning it down or hedging it with serious conditions that will roll back the industry's consolidation and control of this vital utility.\n\nMega-players on the communications capitalism stage have faltered before. Tim Wu, in his undervalued book *The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires* outlines the history of major technological utilities from the telegraph through telephone, radio and TV. He shows how each behemoth overreached itself, raised public indignation and essentially forced the courts to rein them in. His treatment of the Internet holds out hope that net neutrality will be the cause that brings the courts, or public opinion, or government to act.\n\nIt would be nice to hope that the cable giants will overreach as well and the courts will step in. But they may, we feel, have overreached without consequence already, and the courts we have today may not be the courts we need to take a hand when we need it. The government has shown itself pretty well bought off. Public outrage may have to be the main impetus for change. Will it come soon enough?","order":6},{"title":"The UN Panel on Climate Change: Challenges for Progressives","date":"2014-05-01","issue":"May 2014","author":"Bill Boteler","body":"The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) notes that about half of cumulative carbon emissions between 1750 and 2010 took place in the past 40 years.\n\nSources of these emissions between 2000 and 2010 were energy supply 47%, industry 30%, transport 11%, buildings 3%. Those are the areas where policy change can potentially alter what now looks like a forbidding future.\n\nThe IPCC has produced 3 reports since 2013. The first of these dealt with observed and projected changes in the earth's climate. The second report, appearing in March of this year, dealt with how these changes might probably affect ecosystems and human interests. The third, which was just issued, proposes various scenarios for successfully mitigating or preventing climate change in excess of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, which is considered a level that would be associated with more serious damage to our planet. The latter two reports get our attention here.\n\nWe have to note the irony about the IPCC report's reception. The IPCC scientists use terms like \"high confidence\" and \"medium confidence\" to reflect lack of complete unanimity, giving opponents the opening to blast their conclusions as poorly founded. Their deeply democratic process masks the fact that [*nearly all the scientists agree on nearly all the conclusions. *](http://www.salon.com/2014/04/29/how_scientists_are_inadvertently_creating_climate_deniers/)\n\n***Risks***\n\nProjected risks from climate change mentioned in the report include threats to water supplies, extinction of species, threats to food security, health-related threats, and the impact of extreme weather events on human security and the economy.\n\nThe report was in high agreement that the proportion of the human population affected by water scarcity or by major river floods will increase in the 21st century and may lead to more intense competition for water.\n\nThere was high agreement that the loss or redistribution of marine species by the mid 21st century will affect the productivity of fisheries and other ecosystem services These changes will affect fisheries and people dependent on them.\n\nThere was high confidence that projected changes will affect crop yields with negative changes being more common than positive changes.\n\nMajor food crops like wheat and maize will be adversely affected so\n\nthere is high confidence that all aspects of food security will potentially be affected by climate change.\n\nDisease impacts will increase until mid-century, the main impacts on human health will be from a worsening of problems that already exist.\n\nPopulation displacement risk due to extreme weather and food insecurity rises significantly and is greater when people lack resources for planned migration and experience extreme weather events. People in both urban and rural areas of developing countries are particularly at risk.\n\nRisks to urban populations include heat stress, extreme precipitation, flooding, landslides, air pollution drought and water scarcity. Risks to rural populations include scarce water supplies, food security, agricultural incomes and shifts production areas.\n\nClimate change is projected to slow economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, reduce food security and worsen existing poverty while creating new poverty.\n\nThe damage to natural systems and probable extinction events for a significant portion of existing flora and fauna are a horrific prospect. But to get institutional and behavioral changes that could slow or mitigate climate change effects, socialists and other progressives have to persuade people at every level of society, and that means talking about the likely damage to their way of life and safety.\n\n\n\n***Recommendations***\n\nThe report proposes that mitigation efforts should seek to keep greenhouse gases at levels that allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and that enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner. Keeping global temperatures at below a 2 percent increase above pre-industrial levels is the goal.\n\nAny realistic mitigation policy requires large-scale changes in energy and land use. All these scenarios are characterized by rapid improvement in energy efficiency, tripling or quadrupling of the share of renewable energy sources, nuclear energy, CO2 capture and storage or bioenergy development. Land use changes include reforestation and reduced deforestation.\n\nSustainable growth patterns would include a reduction in consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 percentage points over the century relative to a projected annual growth of between 1.6% and 3% per year.\n\nThere was high agreement that Infrastructure developments that lock societies into GHG‐intensive emissions pathways may be difficult and costly to change.\n\nBut emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption such as energy use in households, longer-lasting products, changed diets and reduced food wastes.\n\nDecarbonizing (i.e. reducing the carbon intensity of) electricity generation is a key component of cost effective mitigation. In most scenarios, decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in the industry, buildings, and transport sectors. In a majority of these scenarios the share of renewable energy and nuclear increases form 30% to 80% by 2050.\n\nThe transport sector accounted for 27% of direct emissions in 2010 and there is medium agreement that is projected to approximately double by 2050, but technical and behavior changes plus new infrastructure and urban redevelopment could reduce transport emissions by 15-40% by 2050.\n\nIn 2010, the industry sector accounted for around 28% of final energy use,but the energy intensity of the industry sector could be directly reduced by about 25% compared to the current level through the widescale upgrading, replacement and deployment of best available technologies~~.~~\n\nAgriculture and forestry (called AFOLU) plays a central role for food security and sustainable development. Promoting reforestation and reducing deforestation along with better land management in agriculture and alternative methods in societies where wood is used for cooking and heating are critical to net carbon reduction.\n\nUrbanization is a global trend and is associated with increases in income, and higher urban incomes are correlated with higher consumption of energy and GHG emissions (medium evidence, high agreement). So the next two decades present a window of opportunity for mitigation in urban areas, as a large portion of the world's urban areas will be developed during this period.\n\nThere was wide agreement that the largest mitigation opportunities with respect to human settlements are in rapidly urbanizing areas where urban form and infrastructure are not locked in.\n\nFinally, and of most interest to socialists and other economic progressives, substantial reductions in emissions would require large changes in investment patterns.\n\nThere was high agreement in the value of regulatory and information approaches. The report notes that many national governments have included climate concerns in their legislative and regulatory criteria and that cap-and-trade systems, for instance, have been installed though their effect has been limited. Policies that reduce subsidies for high-carbon industries have been effective as well.\n\nThere was high agreement that technology policy complements other mitigation policies and that this could include a push by governments to publicly fund research and development.\n\nResearch on energy efficiency and production with renewables could go a long way toward easing the transition to what is already guaranteed to be a warmer planet. But even a magic bullet will only work if it outcompetes fossil fuels, unless a significant worldwide movement puts a price on them that reflects their true cost. Socialists and other progressives will have to make the case that lower consumption and a sustainable level of economic activity are necessary and can be adapted and adopted by industrial nations, and that a new lifestyle for a changed environment is thinkable, and necessary.","order":7},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—May 2014 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"May 2014","order":-1,"date":"2014-05-01","body":"Welcome to the May edition of the *Washington Socialist*, monthly email newsletter of the Metro DC Local of Democratic Socialists of America.

He wants it to go away. We don't need a new owner.\" He raised the specter of a future Super Bowl parade (remote as that may seem for the near future) being \"tarnished by protestors along Pennsylvania Ave.\"\n\nHouska, a member of the Couchiching First Nation and a founding board member of the organization [*Not Your Mascots*](http://www.notyourmascots.org/), added that Snyder faces a Supreme Court decision next year that could strip him of the exclusive right to the team's name and logo. If that happens, anyone could sell \"R-word\" apparel and other merchandise, which could result in a big financial loss for Snyder and the team.\n\nHouska, who grew up in International Falls, Minn., said she was surprised by the \"ubiquity of the logo\" when she moved to Washington to work as a tribal lobbyist. Seeing hordes of fans on Metro wearing the Indian-head symbol, the nickname and other stereotyped images of Native Americans opened her eyes to how little most white Americans understand this country's original nations.\n\n\"Eighty-seven percent of references to Native Americans in schoolbooks are pre-1900s,\" she said, leading school children to regarding Natives as \"savage characters. They don't understand that we're attorneys, doctors, curators at museums.\n\n\"Once we know better, we can do better,\" she added.\n\nWise said he became educated on the issue after he met determined Native American activists who showed him how the use of stereotypes by sports teams undermined the self-esteem of Native children. He used his platform at the *Post* to raise the issue, even while meeting resistance from editors and other writers.\n\nWhile much of the forum dwelt on the Washington football team, both Houska and Wise pointed to progress in other areas. Some two-thirds of U.S. high schools that once used Indian nicknames and logos, a total of about 5,000 schools, have changed their team names, as have many colleges, Wise said. Houska's organization also is keeping the heat on other professional teams that use Native logos and imagery.\n\n\"The lens has been focused on the Washington team because the name is a racial slur,\" she said. \"But other teams know it's an issue,\" she said, noting that baseball's Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians and football's Kansas City Chiefs insult Natives through their careless stereotyping.\n\nProgress has been made in the media as well, with *Washington City Paper* refusing to use the official team name, unilaterally renaming the team the \"Pigskins\" in its pages. The *Post*'s editorial page also refuses to use the name, although its sports and other pages have not followed suit. Also, Wise noted that former Washington running back John Riggins – perhaps the franchise's most beloved player and now a radio and TV commentator – never uses the name, but refers to the team as simply \"Washington.\"\n\nThe Oct. 27 forum, which was held at Temple Shalom in Chevy Chase, was organized by the temple and [*Rebrand Washington Football (RWF*](http://www.rebrandwf.org/)), a grassroots organization that is conducting a petition drive to change the Washington team's name. Rabbi Michael Feshbach of Temple Shalom introduced the event, noting that many of his fellow Jews see the name issue as part of the struggle that also condemns anti-Semitism, violence against African Americans and displays of the Confederate battle flag. He noted that as far back as 1992, a conference of rabbis condemned stereotypical team names, and two years ago he was co-signer of a letter to Snyder urging a name change – the reply to which \"must have gotten lost in the mail,\" he joked.\n\nA third chair on the stage next to Houska and Wise remained empty – a chair reserved for a representative of the Washington football team. The team did not respond to the invitation to participate.\n\nPeople interested in getting involved in the campaign to change the name of Washington's team can join RWF at its petition-gathering sessions.

That's at the heart of our socialist strategy and the appeal that we have to many non-radicals who are nevertheless recognizing the cold fact that the workplace is the most unfree zone in the land of the free.\n\nThe steps immediately in front of us to get to that place where workers are taking power and defining their own work are complex but we know they include one big component – aligning workers' skill packages with the work that's available.\n\nThis demand does not, of course, involve the victim-blaming strategy of the Right that asserts today's workers are failures because they haven't upgraded their skills to match the new jobs on offer (from the corporate sector). This realignment involves not only retraining – because it will have to be included – but also an aggressive program to change the nature of the jobs on offer, including a concerted infrastructure program and transitioning vigorously into a post-carbon energy economy.\n\nThere is no better place to witness the clash of corporate agendas with the needs of the future workplace than in the struggle to get Maryland's coal-fired electric power generating plants moved offline and replaced with renewable power sources. The classic elements – corporate sunk costs in old technology, union workers threatened with job loss and plant closings, a resolute environmental community raising serious health concerns about nitrous oxide (NOx) emissions as well as carbon, and a state government that even at its best is too entangled with corporate priorities – have been on display over the past few months.\n\nThe compounding, confounding new factor was the succession of Republican Larry Hogan's administration after the comparatively pro-environment Martin O'Malley administration. O'Malley's regulations on the coal plants, settled and inked in the last days of his tenure, were promptly withdrawn by Hogan days after he was inaugurated. [*The Wall Street favorite NRG Corp*](http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/print-edition/2015/09/25/nrg-energy-s-green-business-costs-are-too-hot-to.html)., owner of six of the most-polluting coal-fired units, never acceded to the O'Malley regulations and apparently got to the Hogan folks. Unlike Raven, which owns three similar plants in or supplying Maryland, NRG fought to avoid installing widely available technology that would bring the plants into compliance for the time being. As with coal throughout the US power-generating array, these plants will eventually have to close as clean-air and CO2 standards stiffen in future years.\n\nWhat became clear in two hearings this fall is that workers and their unions recognize that the state of Maryland, despite much lovely rhetoric from O'Malley and legislative leaders, has not done squat to ensure a smooth transition to renewable energy. Workers catch on that where companies and state governments see transitions as taking place slowly, over years, the transition for workers lasts only as long as their unemployment insurance lasts. There is nobody there for them. Executive orders from the Obama administration promising retraining and bridge programs to keep workers' families solvent are future dreams. ENG Corp. threatens plant closures right now unless the company is relieved from meeting the new standards.\n\nThe winners in this, of course, are ENG's stockholders – not electric ratepayers and emphatically not the IBEW workers in their plants. So much for the alleged benefits of separation of powers in Power – that is, Maryland's ill-fated decision to turn its power grid over to corporate management under the loving hand of the corporate-captured Public Service Commission, with power generation and power distribution divided among the corporate behemoths, invasive species in a system that is a natural monopoly for public ownership and management.\n\nThe consequences of this cascade of bad decisions were on view in early August when the citizen Air Quality Control Advisory Council had a hearing for recommendations on the new Hogan proposals – which he had promised would be as good as or better at cleaning up emissions than the O'Malley proposals. It was a flat lie.\n\nAs Seth Bush outlined in a subsequent Sierra Club blog, the scientists at the Maryland Department of the Environment (with a new boss appointed by Hogan) were suddenly happy to tout the virtues of a plan that gave NRG an escape hatch from upgrading their plants via a new way of calculating the ozone resulting from plant emissions of NOx. The gas is the almost certain cause of the devastating asthma plagues in the state's worst air quality zones (also, no accident, areas where poor and minority residents lived and where some of the plants are situated).\n\nAs the hearings began, a theatrical and unfortunate scenario developed. Sierra Club members and their allies walked in together, as planned, to show the strength of their numbers, and took seats together on one side of the hearing room. On the other side filed in nearly 100 blue-shirted members of the IBEW local that has organized most of the workers at NRG's plants. They had arrived on buses. NRG was playing, [*as the company had all along*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/green/blog/bs-md-hogan-pollution-rule-20150501-story.html), the \"job loss\" and \"plant closure\" card, and the optics of the situation allowed NRG to conceptually pit environmentalists against hard-pressed workers threatened by elite clean-air concerns. For every environmental testimony about asthma and climate change, and blue-shirted IBEW member related his or her long service with the company and concern that if the coal-fired plant closed they would have to move out of the state to find work that fit their experience.\n\nThe AQCAC, snowed by an interminable MDE slide show and left very little time to deliberate, [*gave its OK to the Hogan plan*](http://www.sierraclub.org/maryland/blog/2015/08/mde-backslides-air-quality-rules), setting in motion a sequence that could let the NRG bosses get away without any upgrades to their plants – not only halting state progress toward limiting climate-change factors but prolonging the respiratory diseases, including asthma, that affect the children of plant workers and their \"opponents\" in the environmental movement alike.\n\nSierra Club members acknowledged to themselves at a state jamboree in mid-October that they had done a poor job of showing the areas of solidarity between them and workers in the traditional energy industries, and it has been costly, allowing corporate agendas to separate natural allies. Larry Williams Jr., a former Teamsters organizer recently added to the Sierra Club roster as a labor liaison, noted that collaboration had to take place well in advance of such confrontational situations. Bridge groups like the Blue-Green Alliance, as well as the health and safety departments of individual unions, were suggested as pathways to a better permanent relationship.\n\nBut at a final MDE hearing Oct. 23, one \"environmentalist\" for NRG and a shop steward from IBEW Local 1900 may have outweighed the nearly thirty who testified in favor of the original O'Malley regulations. They again played the job loss and plant closure cards, and in the contrarian context of a Republican governor's administration, it is perhaps too optimistic to expect that common sense will prevail. UPDATE Nov. 6... a key legislative committee has put the Hogan amended regulations on hold as insufficient to meet clean air standards. [*http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/green/blog/bs-md-air-regulation-hold-20151103-story.html*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/green/blog/bs-md-air-regulation-hold-20151103-story.html)\n\nEnvironmentalists, including the strong coterie of us among socialist organizations like DSA, have to recognize the argument-stopping quality of the jobs debate among workers who might be affected by efforts to fight climate change. Union and non-union workers have become accustomed to broken promises of job transition programs and will require evidence of actual help available immediately, not after years of unemployment or Walmart jobs.\n\nThe struggle, as suggested earlier, involves creating good jobs for better-organized workers who can transition to the next economy without being the victims under the bridge. The Sierra Club's labor liaison Williams said they would (or should) take a \"high road\" on labor rights, pushing for card check as well as for clean air.\n\nThe imperative for an alliance between workers and environmental activists is made clear by such engineered confrontations as occurred at the AQCAC hearing between tree-huggers and gritty blue-collar workers, with all the stereotypical power of that narrative. The corporations walk away from those stagey events with their privileges intact and the lives of their stockholders and high-paid executives undisturbed.\n\nVisionary labor leaders like the late Tony Mazzochi of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union (OCAW) as early as the 1980s saw the need for a \"just transition\" plan for workers affected by the inevitable end of fossil fuel dependency.\n\nClimate-change activists are putting some hope into the administration's [*\"Power+\" program*](http://www.appalachiantransition.org/power-initiative-to-focus-existing-federal-money-on-transition-efforts-in-central-appalachia/), which provides strategic planning grants for communities impacted by restrictions on coal mining and coal-fired power generation, followed by implementation grants that can come more quickly if the planning process is already well under way. The cost of transition to workers could be cut – but not by much. Without congressional funding the program offers amounts in the low millions (Brecher, below, puts it at $55 million); little progress on a serious transition to renewable energy sources can take place under those circumstances at the rate that is required. The dominant energy corporations will continue to call the tune and play the plant-closing and job loss card in a way that members of both capitalist parties will have trouble resisting.\n\nIn an [*important new article*](http://www.labor4sustainability.org/articles/a-superfund-for-workers/) on the Labor Network for Sustainability site by Jeremy Brecher, the outline of a comprehensive climate-change job transition plan is laid out:\n\n\"The recent study *Green Growth* by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts and the Center for American Progress estimated the cost of a \"Superfund for workers\" based on a climate action plan that would reduce U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 40% over 20 years. The PERI-CAP plan would create 4.2 million new direct, indirect, and induced jobs.\"\n\nBecause such a program would be keyed to a specific carbon reduction plan it would cost 1.5 million existing jobs in the fossil fuel energy sectors, and a reasonable cost for a \"just transition\" for both workers and their communities would be more like $800 million a year for 10 years. These are the realistic costs of the denial, corporate duplicity and supine governance that has been the rule up to now. Brecher likens the scale of such a \"Superfund for Workers\" program to the post-WW2 G.I. Bill, the military's Base Relocation and Closing allowances for impacted communities and the tobacco settlement payments to states.\n\nWithout the energy and flexibility of a major infrastructure reconstruction program of the sort that Sen. Bernie Sanders is proposing, the struggle to ensure that workers will not be the victims of efforts to move to renewable energy sources will be a heavy lift. Efforts at both state and federal level will be needed. Socialists and environmentalists will have to re-fashion the narrative to include a reorganization of work across the board, both in jobs and skills, that is quite different from the capitalism we experience today.","order":2},{"title":"The View from \"Blockadia\"","date":"2015-10-31","issue":"November 2015","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"***Review of: \"This Changes Everything\": a film by Avi Lewis and Naomi Klein***\n\nThe film based on Naomi Klein's *This Changes Everything: Capitalism versus the Planet* is a tidy ninety-minute overview of the massive book's account. Viewers at the showing at Greenbelt's Old Greenbelt theater – on the evening of the film's premier worldwide – said the movie left them much more optimistic than did the book.\n\nThe film checked off all the points made in the book:\n\n-   energy exploitation, driven by profit-seeking corporations and abetted by willing governments at all levels that are hungry for growth, is also the engine of climate change\n\n-   in the frequent absence of official support, the embattled peoples of the \"sacrifice zones,\" usually the poorest and least politically powerful, have to defend their homes and way of life with street-protest tactics. Klein has referred to the mental geography of these worldwide sacrifice zones as \"Blockadia,\" a scattered movement that is coalescing and growing as more and more working- and middle-class communities and classes find themselves sacrifice zones as well.\n\n-   Implicitly, the planet and its ecosystems are a global \"sacrifice zone\" in the name of growth. And the climate crisis, Klein says in both book and film, has emerged to command our consciousness with supremely bad timing in an era when the ideology of the free market has smothered social-provision tendencies in many areas, including the US and Klein's native Canada.\n\nKlein states, but does not elaborate on, the notion that austerity is the desperate resort of a capitalism that is seeing its own mechanisms founder on their contradictions – a bit of a refinement from *This Changes Everything* (the book) but familiar territory in her earlier *The Shock Doctrine*.\n\nThe Alberta (Canada) tar sands extraction project, the world's largest industrial activity, is the lead-in horror story for the film, contrasting the efforts of native peoples who actually have treaty rights to the land against the corporate behemoth stripping the once-wilderness area to a moonscape the size of some US states.\n\nViewers at the Greenbelt showing expressed satisfaction that the Tory PM Stephen Harper, after four terms spent promoting this devastation in his political base, Alberta, had been defeated the day before the showing by a Liberal sweep in Parliament.\n\nIn fact, the film's effectiveness (and comparative optimism) rested largely on its canny use of interviews with and portraits of the fighting forces of Blockadia, particularly women leaders of native North American groups in Canada and the US as well as Greece (a thwarted gold mining operation) and India (coal-fired plants in low-caste neighborhoods). Klein narrates and is frequently on-camera but always in subdued, background status, giving the limelight to those fighting back in these frontline communities.\n\nThe detailed account of capitalist hegemony and its control of governments and economies that made *This Changes Everything* a significant analysis of the climate challenge is somewhat muted in the film – all the salient points are name-checked but the numbing and, yes, depressing details are largely underdeveloped. Still, the frustration of affected peoples as they try to follow standard bureaucratic procedures for relief only to be blocked at every turn illustrates the hegemonic status quo well and makes their turn to street heat and physical resistance both inevitable and thrilling.\n\nAs in the book, Klein does not present much in the way of conventional strategy for reversing capitalist growth trends and reclaiming public control of the economy, though she is clear that that is the sole path to both saving the planet and recovering real democracy. Brief vignettes – such as Germany's slow, city-by-city reclamation of power grids from corporate to popular control, fueled by public political action in favor of renewable energy sources – show promise as incremental approaches, complementing the outright, sometimes desperate resistance found in Blockadia.\n\nIn short but punchy segments Klein repeats her potshots at climate deniers at the Heartland Institute, and at Royal Society climate scientists in a conference on risky high-tech remedies for effects of climate change. Both illustrate well a contention that comes through more strongly in the movie than the book – that capitalism's rape of the environment is ideologically rooted in an Enlightenment credo that nature was a beast to be tamed and exploited by man.\n\n\"This Changes Everything,\" the movie, is not *This Changes Everything,* the book, and the pair stand as a good model of why these genres have different purposes and functions. The movie works well qua movie to make a compressed case about the relationship between recovering popular sovereignty from capitalism, and slowing or reversing climate change. If it leads viewers to read the book, that's good too.","order":3},{"title":"T[","date":"2015-10-31","issue":"November 2015","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"Over 100 people attended Metro DC DSA's \"We Need Bernie\" rally on Thursday, October 24 in support of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign for president. Held at Busboys and Poets 5<sup>th</sup> and K street location, the event provided an example on the depth of support for Sanders and for a genuinely progressive agenda rooted in civic activism. The rally also highlighted the relevance of democratic socialism to building a political alternative for our country.\n\nThe first speaker, Andy Shallal – owner of Busboys and Poets, peace activist and former DC mayoral candidate – raised the need to do more than just build support for Sanders, arguing that we ought to use his campaign to build a movement of direct action and public engagement that challenges the injustices everywhere visible in our society. Shallal also noted the need to address and overcome one of the critical weaknesses of Sanders's campaign – the fact that it still has not developed sufficient support in communities of color, a fact emphasized by the overwhelmingly white composition of the crowd (which stood in contrast to most of the progressive forums held at Busboys). He stressed that this should not serve as an excuse to withdraw from supporting Sanders, but rather should serve as a reminder to incorporate the message of Black Lives Matter in all work on behalf of his campaign, to address the issue of racism in its specificity – that (as he put it during the Q & A) it is understanding black and white as political categories. By beginning the program in this fashion, Shallal underlined the seriousness of the rally, this event being more than a cheering session for Sanders (though indeed it was that too) but also a discussion of what is to be done, how to continue the organizing.\n\nBarbara Ehrenreich, founding national co-chair (and current honorary chair) of DSA, followed with a talk that emphasized a theme that has long been at the heart of many of her books, including *Nickel and Dimed*: inequality. Ehrenreich talked about the one-sided class war waged by corporations against working people and the importance of Sanders highlighting the disparities which have seen wages stagnate while profits rise, a reality that translates into millions struggling to get by while those who already live in luxury want more for themselves and less for everyone else. This inequality, Ehrenreich noted, hurts all working people, but especially impacts on women, on blacks, on immigrants, on the already poor; Sanders's insistence on that reality having already shifted the debate within the Democratic Party to the left. She added, however, that Hillary Clinton disqualified herself from any pretense of being a progressive or a feminist by her support (a support never disavowed) of Bill Clinton's 1996 Welfare Reform Act, which was racist and misogynist, blaming poor women for their poverty. Nonetheless, Ehrenreich's message was consistent with that of Sanders's campaign, focusing not on attacking others but on the importance of his policy reform proposals: taxing corporations and the wealthy to pay for universal social insurance programs, educational benefits and infrastructure plans, all of which will help the vast majority of Americans. Certainly, she concluded, Sanders is not perfect – noting, for example, his inconsistent policy on the Middle East – but the question is not perfection but of recognizing how principled Sanders has been through the years in most arenas, and of using the opportunity his presidential run provides to further organizing on behalf of social justice for all.\n\nThis was a theme taken up by Larry Cohen, recently retired president of the Communications Workers of America, as he called upon the crowd to seize the moment Sanders campaign represents, a moment of hope that many in the room have long been working to create. Currently chair of Labor for Bernie – the national initiative to build support for Sanders within the trade union movement – Cohen reminded those at the rally that Sanders was talking directly to working-class people about the issues that affect them: massive student debt for their children, fear of running out of money when they retire, the danger of job loss, the difficulty of asserting union rights at work when employed. The resulting insecurity alongside the too many defeats unions have suffered in recent decades have led many in labor to become defensive, which only leads to more defeats. Sanders's campaign, however, provides an opportunity for workers to go on the offensive, which is the reason his message resonates so strongly with many of them – and the reason why union support for him is growing, especially on the local level. Moreover, Sanders is speaking to a wider working class social agenda – Cohen noted his consistent opposition to \"free\" trade pacts, his support for labor law reform and campaign finance reform, his opposition to the Iraq War and his statement that climate change is the greatest danger to US national security. Sanders's campaign, in all these aspects, is a campaign against corporations undermining US democracy, and in all respects represents a challenge to the system by bringing people back into the process. Therein lay what was perhaps Cohen's most important point, that Sanders is creating a decentralized movement that enables people to act to bring about change – action that is key not only to the possibility of a Sanders victory, but also key to any possibility of carrying out his agenda.\n\nRestoring American democracy was at the center of keynote speaker Jim Hightower's presentation. Former Texas State Agricultural Commissioner and publisher of the *Hightower Lowdown*, the progressive populist has long scored the corrosive impact of big businesses on US politics and economy and has long been a fierce advocate of the needs of American working families – and of the need for people to take collective action to regain power from our country's elite. He reminisced about buying a Bernie button when Sanders was running for local office as an independent socialist in Burlington, Vermont many years ago, and thinking then as now that buying a button (or attending a rally) is a good first step only if followed by other steps, by organizing. Hightower's support for Sanders in this presidential run stems from his support for Sanders's call for a political revolution to put our country back in the hands of the people rather than allow it to remain in the hands of the wealthy, of the unelected small minority, who have bought control of the political process.\n\nFollowing the speakers was a lively Q & A session on a host of issues relevant to our collective engagement, ranging from differences over foreign policy to concern over how a focus on the national election might impact local campaigns, from more discussion of Black Lives Matter to questions of how to sustain the work now being done. And the question of democratic socialism came too, with Cohen mentioning that Sanders will be making a major presentation defining his views, but noting that in short form it means building a system rooted in universal social justice and political participation. DSA Deputy Director (and local Metro DC DSA member) David Duhalde came to the front and added that DSA strongly supports Sanders's calls for labor and political rights, for national health insurance and an end to college debt, but that we see these as first steps to a socialism which will make the US more fully democratic and egalitarian.\n\nThe event was organized by a committee of Metro DC DSA members and is itself projected as a step in the process. More actions will be taken in the future, hopefully involving many of the 100 + who came, listened and took part in the local \"We Need Bernie\" rally.\n\n[*Veterans Day, Personal Loss, and Political Insight*](http://dsadc.org/veterans-day-personal-loss-and-political-insight/)\n\nSaturday, October 31st, 2015\n\n***The Washington* Socialist &lt;&gt; November 2015**\n\n*By Daniel Casey Adkins*\n\nVeterans Day and Memorial Day are reminders of family history and personal loss. My father died leading a Marine platoon in attack on Iwo Jima. In the attack, half of his men were either killed or wounded. When hit, he refused medical aid by the corpsman (medic) and ordered him to take care of the platoon's Marines first. He was shot again and died.\n\nMy father took responsibility for confronting totalitarianism and for the care of his Marines. My belief in democratic socialism is an extrapolation of my father's action against fascism and his care for those around him. If you can die for your platoon and country, why not live for humanity and our home the Earth?\n\nWhen my mother remarried I got a live father who was also a veteran. In my efforts to know my fathers, I became an amateur military historian, followed international news, and served a brief time in the Army. My experience has led me to consider questions and points of view not always considered.\n\nOne humbling insight is that for every WW2 American war orphan there are 40 to 60 Russian war orphans. That has to take a toll on the Russian mind and might partly explain Putin's domestic support. Russia's current recession is nothing compared to what Russians have faced before.\n\nUnderstanding US production and civil mobilization is key understanding our victory and knowing the US capacities. WW2 films or books show the individual valor but not the systems and national involvement that organized the victory. As individuals and socialists we need to be aware how our systems work, be they schools, factories, the social relations of work, and production. WW2 Fact: Did you know that the Allies produced 20 times the petroleum that the Axis did?\n\nWe have not seen the US united to solve a problem, but that happened in WW2. What would that unity look like to solve climate change? We have an increasingly growing climate movement, but it is being undercut by fossil-fuel billionaires.\n\nThe Pentagon builds one conventional Army, but uses it in a counter-insurgency mode. How does that mesh with our national goals other than making money for corporations?\n\nCan you stop an insurgency without nation building? If the US wants to limit Islamic extremism, are bullets the only way? Even the military does not believe bullets are the only way but the US and our allies have not started a serious discussion or tried to offer meaningful help to states in harm's way. The defense against extremism needs to be about more than spending money on weapons; it needs to be about training on many levels so extremism can be defeated on the many levels where it exists.\n\nOne topic the world faces is: How do you help a failing state? The world is not likely to have an answer without a strong United Nations. How might that happen and what would it look like?\n\nHow do we use time in seeing and solving problems?

Three local DSA members, including Dave Richardson, a member of the executive committee of DC Jobs with Justice, attended the event, which honored Josyln (Jos) Williams, the retiring president of the Metropolitan Washington Central Labor Council and one of the founders of DC-JwJ.\n\nAll Souls UU Church hosted the event, which parlayed good food and a dynamite band around awards to Williams and three other awardees.\n\nThe other awardees were:\n\n-   Courtney Stewart, head of the Re-Entry Network for Returning Citizens, a group whose \"mission is to connect previously incarcerated individuals to jobs, housing, training, mental health, substance abuse treatment, and recovery programs upon their return to the community.\"\n\n-   Reverend Kendrick Curry, pastor of Pennsylvania Avenue Baptist Church, a University of DC trustee and member of JwJ's Workers' Rights Board that most recently held hearings on a Just Hours initiative.\n\n-   Jean-Louis Peta Ikambana, Director of the American Friends Service Committee-DC Peace and Economic Justice Program who runs the D.C.

The speakers also recalled the origins of DC-JwJ in a struggle for the rights of parking lot attendants that Jos Williams strongly supported.\n\nWilliams came in for gentle ribbing about his deliberate speech and effective deployment of the accents of his native Jamaica. One roaster claimed Williams took immersion classes during his visits back to Jamaica to refresh his accent. Another of William's long-time associates recalled visiting Jos one time and hearing him express amazement that Zimbabwe's controversial president Robert Mugabe could manage to remain in office for 30 years, and that he might have the effrontery to do so. But Jos Williams, the speaker noted, has himself served more than 30 years as the president of the Labor Council. Barris, who gained her position at DC-JwJ following a screening by a hiring committee of which Williams was a prominent member, recalled how intimidating he had seemed at her initial interview. But the roasters, despite their claims, came up with few zingers and many affectionate memories of Williams, with more toasts than roasts.\n\nThe evening was kept on schedule by MCs Eugene Puryear and Tiffany Flowers of the Stop Police Terror Project DC and \\#BlackLivesMatter, with observations and interventions from Nikki Lewis, JwJ's executive director.\n\n*David Richardson and Andy Feeney contributed to this article.*"},{"title":"AFTER PARIS- THE RIGHT ROAD TO COMBATING TERRORISM","date":"2015-12-01","issue":"December 2015","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Last month's horrific terrorist attacks in Paris brought forth a swift barrage of responses, actual and proposed, from politicians in the West. France immediately took revenge on the Islamic State (known as ISIS), of which the perpetrators were presumed to be members, by bombing the Syrian city of Raqqa, the group's base of operations. Other European leaders urged the elimination of free movement within the European Union, which was one of the hallmarks of Europe's integration. Coming only months after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, it is understandable that the French in particular, and Europeans in general, were eager to do something, anything, in response.\n\nBut there seemed to be more rhetoric from American leaders than European, with U.S. politicos rushing to outdo each other on who could appear the most fearless in ensuring that a similar attack would not happen here. Republican candidates for president, not surprisingly, thumped their chests most vigorously, tying the attack to the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis, based on suspicions that some of the attackers might have attached themselves to the stream of migrants[*. Religious intolerance*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rabid-dogs-and-muslim-id-cards-anti-islam-rhetoric-grows-in-gop/2015/11/19/1cdf9f04-8ee5-11e5-baf4-bdf37355da0c_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-high_islampolitics-848pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory) raised its ugly head, as front-runner Donald Trump called for the shuttering of mosques and, with ominous overtones of Germany in the 1930s, creating a registry of American Muslims; while Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz, trying to break out of the middle of the pack, called for allowing only Christian refugees to enter the United States. Ben Carson likened some Muslims to \"rabid dogs.\" A stream of governors, almost all of them Republican, vowed that they would not let refugees into their states, notwithstanding that governors have no control over people moving into and out of states once they have entered the country. Lindsay Graham, the leading hawk among GOP candidates (if not a leader in any other sense), wants to see U.S. combat boots on the ground in the Middle East, the sooner the better.\n\nCalmer heads have proposed less offensive solutions, but these voices have unfortunately been largely drowned out in the ongoing hysteria. All of the Democratic candidates for president participating in the debate the day after the attacks emphasized that any U.S. response must be in collaboration with countries in the Middle East. Bernie Sanders, for one, in his [*Nov. 19 address at Georgetown University*](http://www.vox.com/2015/11/19/9762028/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism), said that \"the fight against ISIS is a struggle for the soul of Islam, and countering violent extremism and destroying ISIS must be done primarily by Muslim nations – with the strong support of their global partners.\"\n\nSanders' caution is borne of experience. If one examines objectively the recent history of U.S. involvement in the Middle East, a pattern emerges: The more the United States intervenes, the worse things get. The 1990-91 Gulf War, while resulting in driving Iraqi troops from Kuwait, inflamed and radicalized many people in the region over U.S. troops remaining in Saudi Arabia, Islam's \"holy land,\" after the fighting was over. This was one of the grievances cited by Osama bin Laden that motivated his organization al-Qaeda to carry out the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Then came the disastrous 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq over false accusations that Iraq was behind the 2001 attacks and that it was manufacturing \"weapons of mass destruction.\" The war tore Iraq apart and created the political vacuum that allowed ISIS to take root. And there is the long-standing resentment by Arab countries over unwavering U.S. support for Israel, no matter how much that country oppresses Palestinians under its occupation. For the United States, the goals of Mideast policy have been to protect Israel and keep the region's supply of oil flowing, not necessarily in that order. If that means stepping on the necks of most of the people of region, so be it.\n\nThe overreach of the West in the Middle East is a long-simmering source of resentment in Muslim lands and fuel for the growth of extremism in the region, a phenomenon that formed a backdrop of the *Cairo Trilogy* of Nobel Prize-winning Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz. This saga of a fictional Egyptian family, spanning the period between the two world wars, depicted the tensions in Egyptian society as Western values and mores encroached on the Muslim practices that had persisted for centuries. Some embraced the liberating effects of the new ways, while others, fearing a loss of control over their own society, joined Islamic organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood. \"Should we give up our religion in order to please foreigners?\" asks a character who has embraced strict Islam as a response to creeping Western influences. Politicians who opine on how their Middle East policies would end our headaches in the region would do well to read Mahfouz before forming their half-baked opinions.\n\nThis loss of control, this encroachment of Western ways that threaten to erase tradition, has contributed to the backlash and rise of Islamic radicalism as a defense mechanism. The United States is correctly perceived as the main engine of Westernization in the Middle East. Rhetoric such as that coming from Trump, Bush and Cruz only confirms Muslim fears that the United States intends to Christianize the Islamic lands, as does the [*proposal of Ohio Gov. John Kasich*](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/john-kasich-judeo-christian-agency-216056) – another GOP presidential hopeful – for a new federal agency to spread \"Judeo-Christian values.\" ISIS has gotten the message, and its [*claim of responsibility*](http://www.vox.com/2015/11/14/9734794/isis-claim-paris-statement) for the Paris attacks cited France as a \"crusader nation\" for its past air strikes against ISIS forces. But a more realistic fear is that the United States and its Western allies intend to incorporate the Mideast more firmly into the global capitalist web, converting a region more accustomed to small, family-owned business into yet another source of low-wage labor and cheap natural resources.\n\nTo be sure, there are many features of Western society that most of us would like to see spread more widely in the Middle East and other Muslim lands, including freedom of religious practice, greater democracy and – perhaps most of all – gender equality in a region where, in many places, women are virtually slaves of their husbands or fathers. Many Middle Easterners, however, see these values as inseparable from rapacious capitalism, Christianity, and looting of their wealth. When viewed this way, one can see the attraction of preserving the old ways by any means necessary.\n\nThose who see this as a battle between peaceful, tolerant Christianity and violent, intolerant Islam have a short view of history. We are only a few centuries removed from the Crusades, the Inquisition, the religious bloodletting of the Thirty Years War and the expulsion of Jews from England and Spain; and less than a century removed from pogroms and the Holocaust – the latter of which was made possible by centuries of Christian intolerance. The ideals of freedom of thought and freedom of worship in Europe came about only after centuries of struggle and sectarian violence. The predominantly Christian countries were the colonizers, their armies accompanied by missionaries who converted natives at gunpoint. Western colonization included domination over Muslim lands, which precipitated an earlier wave of Muslim immigration to Europe – France being one of the principal destinations. The marginalization and poverty experienced these European Muslim communities have experienced have made them a breeding ground for extremist organizations.\n\nWhy does it seem (\"seem\" is the operative word) that there are no Christian terrorists? The answer: Christianity has been joined at the hip to the world's most powerful armies. It is the beleaguered Muslims that feel the need to fight back. I am reminded of a story (possibly apocryphal) of Mohandas Gandhi being asked what he thought about Western civilization, to which he was said to respond, \"I think it would be a good idea.\"\n\nThe answer is, then, not the big boot of U.S. intervention in the region, but the exercise of soft power. Support the moderate Muslim nations that show Islam need not mean repression and dictatorship; there are too few of them but Turkey is the best example (although it is battling its own domestic Islamists). Offer friendship and assistance, not guns and bombs. And part of this assistance is not shunning the region's refugees, but rather doing our share to offer refuge. Lead by example, not by invasion. It is the longer, harder road, but the only path to the destination of true peace.","order":0},{"title":"Convention Impressions","date":"2015-12-01","issue":"December 2015","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"The best moment at this year's DSA national convention, for me, came on the last day. The auditorium where the plenary was meeting was chilly, and I ducked out for a few minutes to get an extra sweater. When I returned to the table seating most of the Metro DC delegation, four of our younger members were engaged in vigorous exchanges with Jose and Ingrid about local organizing possibilities for the 'We Need Bernie' campaign. I had nothing at all to contribute, partly because I was late but mostly because the younger members, Jose and Ingrid were doing all the political work. It was a great moment.\n\nLooking around the auditorium, I also noticed younger members from many other chapters in lively discussions about DSA's future. Baby Boomers my age and older still made up a majority in the room, but not an overwhelming one. And I reflected that whatever achievements and failures DSA has seen since I got involved six years ago, we've begun to recruit a new generation of democratic socialists to succeed those who either knew Michael Harrington personally, or could have. The thought gives me hope for socialism's future is this traditionally anti-socialist culture. Kudos to Jessie, Merrill, Sammy and Ken from Metro DC (and to Jonathan from our new Baltimore chapter} for the energy and intelligence with which they're picking up the torch for change.\n\nAnother fine moment came during Saturday night's customary fundraising event, which in past conventions has impressed me as a fairly grim affair in which DSA leadership tries to guilt-trip the delegates into giving more to DSA than we really want to. This year the sum donated exceeded the leadership's target, which was very impressive. Some delegates made extremely generous pledges totaling in the hundreds of dollars; and a few made generous sustainer pledges totaling even more. But what I liked best was that Joe Schwartz, DSA's long-time political guru, dropped his customary university professor's stance and did leftwing stand-up comedy at the fundraiser to make the giving more bearable. Joe can be an implacable opponent in internal DSA political debates, but on this night he was both relaxed and funny, and I think even some of his customary political adversaries enjoyed it. Solidarity Forever! And may one-liners make us strong!\n\nI also enjoyed the workshop on Socialist Feminism: Theory and Practice that Carolyn Byerly from our steering committee led with Peg Strobel from Chicago; it gave me a sense of what I think socialist feminists and others mean when they speak of creating a \"safe space\" for people who may be nervous about fitting into somebody else's agenda. I felt surprisingly safe listening to Carolyn and Peg discuss feminism, and I hope I've learned something about group process, as well as the history of the feminist movement. Also useful was a workshop on techniques for strengthening local chapters led by David Green of Detroit and Hope Adair from Atlanta.\n\nFinally, I found it politically and personally rewarding – as well as cheap – to share a 5-man bedroom with four of my DC and Baltimore comrades. We talked late into the night and I really enjoyed the experience, despite one comrade's amazing Richter-scale snore. Even with the snore, I would happily do it again.","order":1},{"title":"CONVENTION WORKSHOP ON FEMINISM YIELDS PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVEMENT, ISSUES OF PRACTICE","date":"2015-12-01","issue":"December 2015","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"A \"theory and practice\" workshop on feminism in our work and in our locals at DSA's 2015 convention illuminated bright spots and persisting gendered practices in both spheres.\n\nLed by Carolyn Byerly of the Metro DC local and Peg Strobel of the Chicago/Oak Park local, the session began with the historical development of feminist theory and practice on the left.\n\nStrobel, an historian, outlined the varied narrative history of the \"woman question\" on the left, with Engels giving it more attention than Marx and examining matrilineal societies such as the Iroquois Confederation. Early socialist focus on those who sold their labor to capitalists – nearly all male – couldn't encompass the unpaid labor of women at home. Later (turn of the 19<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> centuries) socialists diverted into the function and role of marriage, which Emma Goldman accurately identified as \"an economic arrangement, an insurance pact\" that routinely subordinated women. Ancillary debates about sexuality beyond the binary fused with theory that projected mature (future) socialism as a context for deregulated love, both in parallel development, as epitomized in the work of the Russian feminist Alexandra Kollontai.\n\nByerly, a feminist communication scholar, recounted the growth of feminism in and out of the stream of left political development. Women, she noted, were involved in early trade union support and left parties, including the Socialist Party, and were supporters in the suffrage struggle (but there were internal fights about how suffrage and class politics intersected, or didn't). In the world war and interwar periods feminism appeared more often as lifestyle debates in the industrial West but sexual equality was advanced as law in some Communist societies. In the theory resurgence of the 1960s the class question resumed, with race added – white bourgeois women seemed privileged to do all the speaking for women, leaning the discussion toward liberal feminism and away from the radical variety. Left organizations like DSA have helped integrate class and race questions back into the discussion but feminism is an unfinished and dynamic theory.\n\nIn a group activity, participants developed a view of how successfully feminist perspectives and practices were playing out in their locals. Problems of what some were experiencing in their locals included:\n\n-   Gendered assumptions about the division of labor — some still saw women doing chapter maintenance and even post-meeting cleanup with tacit male acceptance;\n\n-   Specific constraints (especially family) that limited women's time for activism; locals are not always sure or able to accommodate women;\n\n-   Internal discussions are still often dominated by men and women have to struggle for an equitable role in leadership and direction despite bylaw guidelines.\n\nBut some progress was seen by some in:\n\n-   A strong role for women in the fast-growing Austin local, many recruited from union activists;\n\n-   Female leadership in other locals such as DC and Detroit;\n\n-   Conscious, local-wide participation in important women's issue areas such as reproductive rights, violence against women and affordable housing;\n\n-   Success in recruiting women through nontraditional (for DSA) outreach – the Sanders campaign, book discussion groups.\n\n\n\n*Thanks to Carolyn Byerly for her excellent notes on the session.*","order":2},{"title":"GOOD READS FOR SOCIALISTS","date":"2015-12-01","issue":"December 2015","author":"","body":"As a frontline part of the Solidarity Economy, food co-ops are going into food deserts that the chain groceries are avoiding to preserve their Wall Street standing.

These are not all worker-run but some are unionized and have been around a while.\n\nUtility cooperatives are tasked with delivering electricity, water, or telecommunications to their members. Many of these cooperatives were created during the New Deal and are in Republican-dominated states. Profits are either reinvested or distributed to members based on the member's investment in the coop. Each member has an equal say as every other member. Most of these cooperatives are in rural America. Many cooperatives strive to provide the best service at the lowest cost, but rural infrastructure is more costly then the more compact urban areas. These cooperatives receive a preference from federal Power Administrations.\n\nIn additions to the Tennessee Valley Administration, there are four Department of Energy Power Administrations. These power administrations cover most of the U.S. except for the Northeast. Most of these were created in the 1930s and provide low-cost electricity for public agencies, including states, cities, towns, electric cooperatives, and Native American tribes. These administrations originally were based on hydroelectric power but now include nuclear and coal plants. Power left over after supplying public needs are sold on the open market. These administrations aid load balancing from intermittent renewable generation. They also play a role in flood control and regional environmental management.\n\nOne reason for these organizations was to eliminate rural poverty and develop the countryside. The coops and the power administrations brought electric lighting to much of America. Given the sad state of Appalachia, there is the need for an Appalachian power administration today that could be based on renewables.\n\nThe power administrations played a significant part in the World War II victory by providing the electricity for the production of aluminum for aircraft. They also served the Manhattan Project.\n\nUnder President Clinton federal unions partnered with their agencies. If a democratic socialist does become president in the near future, the possibilities of agency/union partnering need to be considered and used. Worker coops are great, but creating a more cooperative hierarchical structure need to be on our to-do list too. There are tools for getting more cooperation in hierarchical organizations. A 360-degree evaluation of staff and managers can provide critiques to remedy a kiss-up, kick-down authoritarian culture. The quality movement provides ways to improve processes and get staff involved in how organizations work. These and many other policies can humanize hierarchical organizations and make them more productive.\n\n[*Health, Medicine and Social Change: A Review of the film Revolutionary Medicine: the Story of the first Garifuna Hospital*](http://dsadc.org/health-medicine-and-social-change-a-review-of-the-film-revolutionary-medicine-the-story-of-the-first-garifuna-hospital/)\n\nTuesday, December 1st, 2015\n\n***The Washington Socialist* &lt;&gt; December 2015 **\n\n*By Kurt Stand*\n\nHealth care must speak to each individual's physiological needs – but so too it must address individuals' psychological needs, and must recognize the social, economic and cultural conditions within which people live and work. Those connections are made explicit in ***Revolutionary Medicine: the story of the first Garifuna Hospital,*** a 45-minute film that documents the creation of a free community-run hospital in Garifuna – one of the poorest communities in Honduras (itself, one of the poorest countries in Latin America) – a community without roads, electricity, or social services of any kind. Descended from survivors of a shipwrecked British slave vessel in the early 17<sup>th</sup> century, the Garifuna people have long battled racism, poverty and underdevelopment. Prior to the building of the hospital, the nearest doctor or medical facility was more than 12 hours distant, a reality that meant that illness was often simply a death sentence – a truth reflected in the grim detail of an average life span of 52. About 75 people attended the showing at the AFL-CIO headquarters in an event sponsored by the Federation, the Metro DC Labor Council and the National Nurses Union. The NNU has developed a solidarity relationship with medical practitioners in Honduras and sees in its work the kind of bottom-up health care that will be possible in the US only if and when we adopt a single-payer health system – a point made both by NNU Political Director Ken Zinn and by medical anthropologist and American University Associate Professor Adrienne Pine, who introduced the film. What that means in practice was described in greater detail after the screening by Dr. Luther Castillo – a Garifuna doctor who founded the hospital.\n\nProduced and directed by independent documentarian Beth Gaglia, based in Washington DC, and Canadian film maker Jesse Freeston, based in Montreal, the movie tells the story of the building of a hospital – run on solar power from necessity owing to the absence of electrical power – in Ciriboya, Colon on Honduras' Caribbean Coast. The hospital does not stand alone — it is part of a holistic health system built by members of the community it serves; thus all services, consultations, and medications are provided free of charge, a necessity if people who live in grinding poverty are otherwise to be served. The community has not only built the hospital, but defended it as well against threats by the right-wing government that has dominated the country since the 2009 US-backed coup that ousted Honduran' democratically–elected president Manuel Zelaya after he began to implement a modest program of social reform. Free health care for the poorest is a threat to a medical system that has taken privatization to the extreme as patients must now pay for everything – from doctors' surgical gloves to the needles used when getting a vaccination. And the grass-roots community organization inherent in the building and running of the hospital is itself a form of organization that stands in the way of threated displacement by a right-wing government that seeks to remove the Garifuna from their land and turn the area into a tourist playground for the well-heeled from abroad.\n\nWatching the film, listening to interviews with Castillo and the other men and women working at the hospital, one question kept recurring – just how did people from such isolated areas even get the chance to become doctors? The answer is given by Castillo in the documentary (and explained by him in greater depth during his talk at the AFL-CIO after the showing): Cuba's medical school – which provides training for poor students from the poorest countries in the world (and from impoverished areas in the US) – asking only that those so trained go back to serve the communities from whence they came. Castillo was such a student as are virtually all of Garifuna's doctors and nurses. It is in Cuba too that a sense of the interconnection between personal health and social health is made. Castillo explained the matter by talking about how almost all the women they treat complain of back pain. The individual diagnosis might be medication followed by rest – but poor women who work and raise children can't rest. And simply prescribing more medicine has only limited value, all the more so as an inadequate diet means that medication can easily lead to gastritis or other stomach problems. Instead there is a need to go to the source of the problem, the 40-60 pounds of firewood women carry every day for that is the only source of power they have for their homes. Thus, alongside medication, alongside, rest, alongside better food, what is needed is development that will serve, not exploit or displace, the community. Again and again, the film shows such connections being made.\n\nThe film includes a mass march led by 214 drums – a march that was also a dance – following a 27-hour journey by foot and bus to the national capital, Tegucigalpa, to protest social exclusion. The marchers then returned home (the same 27-hour trip in reverse), energized by the experience, energized by acting and not simply being victimized. Such demonstrations, just as the work of the hospital, do not happen easily or spontaneously, but it can happen when people see the connection of social change on the quality of their lives and future – social action, that is, returning back to individual needs and hopes. The connecting link is solidarity, for as Castillo said during that protest, \"We believe in the accelerating march toward a new country, with a new constitution that reflects the rainbow of different faces in this country, the indigenous, the blacks, the workers, the farmers, the unionists, the professionals, that they are all recognized.\"\n\nFor more information about the film or information as to how to order it go to: http://revolutionarymedicine.org/","order":4},{"title":"Living Our Strategy, Not Just Speaking It: Thoughts on the DSA 2015 Convention","date":"2015-12-01","issue":"December 2015","author":"M.

This rashness is often rooted in noble aims—we are empathetic to the suffering of people around us, we are indignant at the injustices of inequality, and we genuinely desire to implement progressive social change. We see a problem, so we rush in to try to solve it. Unfortunately, without larger goals in mind, this type of activism often fails to generate systematic change in the long-term. It may solve individual issues here and there and it may do a lot of good for many people, but the structural inequalities all too often remain.

The document affirms the good work that DSA chapters are doing all over the country to rectify inequality and present positive, socialist alternatives to our current capitalist system. But it also defines the long-term goals of the organization as a whole in such a way that it allows activists to focus their work on issues that will have the most effective and long-lasting gains both for the organization itself and for the democratic socialist aim of creating a more equitable society. The strategy document emphasizes long-term goals for the organization, such as reaching out to people of color, women and other marginalized communities, that will grow democratic socialism as a national movement while also allowing chapters to focus on local problems in their own communities. The document also contained a sense of urgency, particularly surrounding the dire need for climate justice in a globe that has been ravaged by capitalism, which will hopefully spur chapters to increase their local activism and raise the profile of democratic socialism. If our movement is to have any traction, we cannot simply react to problems as they arise, but we must also proactively seek out opportunities to build coalitions with other groups and advance our vision of a democratically controlled economic sector. The strategy document acts as a roadmap for DSA nationally, locally and even individually to take these proactive steps.\n\nWhat struck me most at the convention, other than the breadth of the strategy document itself, was the way in which it was adopted. Unlike many other organizations with which I have been involved, DSA implemented its strategy in a democratic manner that aligned with the organization's principles. Instead of the document being formulated by a national staff and board and then foisted upon the individual members, the document was a product of collaboration and planning at both the national and local levels. Individual members were given ample opportunity to weigh in on the strategy document and suggest amendments to it. Considerable time at the convention was dedicated to discussing the document so that every delegate present thoroughly understood the strategy and could vote for its passage with confidence. Instead of claiming to be for the grassroots while functioning under a top-down administration, the DSA convention operated as a microcosm of the informed, fair and democratic society that it hopes to bring about.\n\nThis attitude was present in the passage of the strategy document, but it also permeated the entire proceedings of the convention. At other conferences and national gatherings that I have attended, hosted by other organizations, I have often found the national staff, board and other organizational leaders to be distant from the ordinary members of the movement. Other conventions that I have attended have brought in lauded speakers and activists who all too often end up behaving like drama queens and divas, demanding special attention and deference, even as they give lofty speeches about democratic principles. I experienced none of this snobbery or superiority at the DSA convention. The national staff was helpful and always attentive, despite the tireless work that they were all doing to ensure that the plenaries and workshops ran smoothly. All of the DSA leaders whom I met were friendly and open, and they treated me as though I was just as important to the organization as they were. Rather than promoting themselves or stroking their own egos, people seemed genuinely excited to connect with other democratic socialists, trade tips on building local chapters, and share stories about how they had become involved in Left politics. The atmosphere of the convention was welcoming, and watching the commitment of everyone to living out their democratic values of fairness and equality in both their individual interactions with people and their larger activism was truly empowering.\n\nGiven this environment of solidarity, I am confident that the DSA strategy document will not just be words on paper but an implemented guide that is acted upon by local chapters and activists. A strategy is only useful if it leads to action, and DSA's strategy document will only be as useful as the organization's individual members make it. We cannot merely speak about our strategy. We must also live it. Fortunately, I expect that DSA's members are more than up to that challenge.\n\n[*The US Military's Crippling Obsession with High-Tech Death*](http://dsadc.org/the-us-militarys-crippling-obsession-with-high-tech-death/)\n\nTuesday, December 1st, 2015\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;* December 2015**\n\n*****Kill Chain: The Rise of the High-Tech Assassins*\n\nA book by Andrew Cockburn (Verso, 2015)\n\nReview by *David H. Richardson*\n\nIn 1999, then-presidential candidate George Bush said in a speech at The Citadel \"When direct threats to America are discovered, I know that the best defense can be a strong and swift offense—including the use of Special Operations Forces ... we must be prepared to strike across the world with pinpoint accuracy—with long-range aircraft and perhaps with unmanned systems.\" (p. 250) Thirteen years later, President Obama, in his defense vision, declared that \"as we reduce the overall defense budget, we will protect, and in some cases increase, our investments in special operations forces, in new technologies like ISR and unmanned systems ...\" (p. 250) Since 2001, the American taxpayer has shelled out trillions, not billions, in military adventures, only to see the terrorists expand from a few bases maintained in Afghanistan at the sufferance of the Taliban, to a territory the size of Utah with outposts in a half-dozen other countries. While suffering setbacks, their trajectory was and continues to be on the rise, while American influence in the Middle East has been and is on the decline.\n\n*Kill Chain: The Rise of the High-Tech Assassins* by Andrew Cockburn, an editor of *Harper's* magazine and a younger brother of the late Alexander Cockburn, is the story of this failure.<span id=\"_ftnref1\" class=\"anchor\"></span>*\\[1\\]* Given the dollar amounts expended, let alone the loss of life, the result can only be characterized as catastrophic. While a catastrophe of this magnitude can only be described as a team effort on the part of the US military, the US Air Force, with its drone operations, its core belief in strategic bombing, and its faith in computer automated systems, is at the top of the list. The US Army brass, in its determination to wage war against civilian populations, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan, also comes in for its share of criticism. By comparison the enlisted men and low-ranking officers who had to actually bear the brunt of the fighting come off relatively lightly, and are often seen as micro-managed by the generals.\n\nThe kill chain itself is the chain of command that authorizes lethal drone strikes and special operations. As this review is being written, the news is awash with reports of the death by drone strike of Mohammed Emwazi or \"Jihadi John,\" the British Muslim who executed hostages on video, and Wisam al Zubaidi, the head of the ISIS affiliate in Libya. Before we place too much credence in these reports, we should look at the results of some past drone strikes. On a cold night in February 2010, two small SUVs and a four-door pickup carrying 35 men, women, and children, four under age six, were traveling toward Kandahar on the way to Kabul. It was a slow trip with stops for engine trouble and a flat tire. On the seemingly deserted highway, unknown to the group, a Special Ops raiding party had landed nearby and a reconnaissance drone circled overhead. Backing up the drone was a ground crew including the pilot, intelligence analysts, and communications officers in Nevada and Florida. Instead of people, what they saw on their screens was blobs on the ground. When first picked up, the vehicles were headed toward the raiding party, but never came closer than 10 miles, and after an hour they turned away. Nonetheless, a helicopter gunship attack was called in which killed 23 people, including two boys three and four, and wounded eight men, one woman, and three children between five and 14. On the basis of pictures from the drone they had all been positively identified as military-age males.\n\n**In fact, the Air Force knew that this sort of thing was likely to happen when they put the drones into service. A military reform movement in the 1980s attempted to stem the tide of ever more expensive weapons of dubious utility, and in 1983 it succeeded in creating the Office of Operational Test and Evaluation, one of the least-popular agencies ever conceived. In 2001 new Director Thomas P. Christie took as his first project to test the Predator drone. He found that the Predator couldn't take off or land except in near-perfect weather: snow, rain, ice, frost, or fog, it didn't matter. Drones operate at 12,000 to 15,000 feet to avoid hand-held surface-to-air missiles. The team used a rating scale for visual accuracy to analyze data from 15,000 feet, from 1 for a large airplane to 9, the ability to recognize a human face. While \"\\[t\\]he drones were supposed to score 6, 'recognize supply dumps, identify vehicles' at a range of 6 miles, the day TV scored no better than 2.7. Overall, Predator could find less than a third of its targets.\" (p. 68) The images were never good enough to distinguish between a truck and a tank. People turn into blobs on the screen, with the result that the viewers engage in a kind of Rorschach test, and see whatever they want to see. The final report, sent to the secretary of defense, the heads of all the relevant congressional committees, and the top brass, said that \"The Predator UAV is not operationally effective. This conclusion is based on poor performance in target location accuracy, ineffective communications, and limits imposed by relatively benign weather.\" (p. 71) The report was ignored.\n\n**The book itself is a page turner: it reads like action fiction, sci fi, a detective novel, pick your favorite escape vehicle, and it draws you in in a similar way. It's a series of stories around a theme, the endless fascination with technology as a means of war fighting, and the fiascoes that have resulted therefrom.<span id=\"_ftnref2\" class=\"anchor\"></span>*\\[2\\]* We all know how the seemingly random killings have turned the people of the Middle East against us, and there's enough of that in the book. For me, however, the main story concerns the increasing impotence of the US military despite, or perhaps because of, its dramatic investment in technology. One early implementation of this profoundly mistaken direction was the $6 billion electric fence intended to keep \"the\" Ho Chi Minh Trail from delivering supplies to the Viet Cong in South Vietnam. It took the North only a week to circumvent it, in part because there was no actual trail but rather a network that could be utilized to confuse and frustrate the electronics.\n\n**Another early implementation was the Air Force strategy in World War II that the war could be won by strategic bombing alone. The idea was that a modern economy relies on inter-connectivity, and that the destruction of key links could bring a whole country to a halt. However, it turned out that ball bearings weren't the key to the functioning of the Reich, nor were hydroelectric dams, not were a whole list of other possible key links. The 1943 British firebombing of Hamburg, for example, had the effect of actually increasing production in that city. Before the bombing there had been a labor shortage in Hamburg. However, the bombs demolished the downtown, and people who had worked in the service sector, hotels, restaurants and the like, saw their places of employment destroyed, and went to work in the war plants on the outskirts. The result of the strategic bombing campaign was that we came close to implementing Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau's vision of turning Germany into a cow pasture, yet the German war machine chugged on until it was defeated on the ground.\n\n**ater, facing more recent enemies without a military industrial complex, the key links came to be seen as people rather than things, which didn't work any better. This strategy was tried out in the war on drugs, with the initial target being Pablo Escobar and the Medellin cocaine cartel. While numerous surveillance aircraft were employed in the hunt for Escobar, they were of no help and he was eventually located with the help of the rival Cali cartel. Alas, their assistance did them no good, and we destroyed the Cali cartel as well. If these moves had been successful in stemming the tide of cocaine, we should have seen prices rise in the United States. In fact, \"cocaine prices ... immediately went into a precipitous decline.\" (p. 101) The reason was that the cartels had created a duopoly, and once they were broken up they were replaced by a couple of dozen smaller but even more lethal operations which ***competed*** with each other, thereby driving the prices down. This led former Air Force pilot Rex Rivolo, then with Operations Evaluation, to suggest that \"\\[t\\]he best thing would have been to keep one cartel over which we had some control.\" (p. 102) More generally, shadowy organizations involved in crime or terrorism are decentralized, and don't depend on their top leaders for their success. Rather, under the top leaders are younger, more violent guys ready to step up when the top guy goes down, and hence assassinating the leaders is a fool's errand.\n\n**The first few months of the war in Afghanistan were a near-total success. After the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif, the leaders of the Taliban fled south to Pakistan and the lower level fighters were told to go home, with the result that the US military very quickly established control of the whole country. However, the Americans and the British insisted on targeting the now departed leaders, with the result that local warlords and even ordinary Afghans turned over their enemies as terrorists, thereby ingratiating themselves with the new rulers and turning a nice profit as well. After several iterations, the end result was the establishment of the \"signature strike,\" in which \"it would no longer be necessary to identify the target. Merely looking like a terrorist would be sufficient to trigger a strike.\" (p. 224) Group gatherings were especially suspect, so wedding parties, Afghan local councils called jirgas, and funeral processions did not occur as people attempted not to act like terrorists were thought to act.\n\nIncompetent as they may be against America's enemies, there is one battle the armed forces are good at: the budget wars in Washington. The branch that is actually able to fight a war all by itself is the Navy, together with its Naval Air Systems Command and Marine Corps. By comparison, the Air Force and the Army are hobbled by their mutual dependence and hence start at a disadvantage in the battle for the budget. To compensate, the Air Force developed the doctrine that strategic bombing could win a war all by itself, with a dramatic reduction in American casualties to boot. It didn't work in WWII, it isn't working against ISIS, and there is no evidence that it has worked anytime in between. It has, however, created the potential to incinerate the planet in a hypothetical nuclear exchange.\n\n**In a sense the drone is the ultimate high-tech weapon, (initially) inexpensive, lethal, putting no Americans in harms way, and (at least where there are no real air defense systems) virtually invulnerable. With its monitors widely available in generals' offices, it gives the illusion that they can conduct the battle themselves, never mind that they are over-riding and micromanaging the officers who have responsibility on the ground. Weaponized and with a license to kill, what could go wrong?\n\n**For all its faults, the Predator was relatively cheap at $5 million per copy. The 2005 Reaper drone, at $30 million plus $5 million per year maintenance, much more than older manned aircraft, was billed as an improvement. However, \"it carries essentially the same sensors as the Predator,\" (p. 178) i.e., people still appear as blobs with no ability to recognize gender, let alone whether they are armed or not. However, the prices were getting up to levels that could interest the major defense contractors, and Northrup Grumman came out with the Global Hawk, whose initial price tag ballooned from $10 million to $223 million each. Unwanted by either the Air Force or the Obama Administration, the high price turned out actually to be an advantage in the budget debates, since the work could be spread over more congressional districts. It replaced the U-2, which, as it turns out, took better photographs. (p. 181) One thing all these high-tech strategies share is the hubris of their proponents and their unwillingness to face facts as one after another of their failures are swept under the rug.\n\n**The whole high-tech system was tested at a war game called Millennial Challenge 2002.<span id=\"_ftnref3\" class=\"anchor\"></span>*\\[3\\]* Marine Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper commanded the Red (enemy) team as a rogue military commander in the Persian Gulf for some reason willing to take on the US Military. Full of scorn for the theories underlying the standard doctrine, Van Riper surmised that the implied rules were secondary, and he played to win. While the Challenge involved thousands of troops, ground vehicles, and aircraft scattered across the United States, much of the action was virtual, played as a computer game. In the first few hours, the Blue (US) team knocked out Van Riper's fiber optics, expecting him to be forced to use easily intercepted radio communications. Instead, he used motorcycle couriers and coded messages embedded in in the Muslim calls to prayer. As planned, a US carrier task force steamed up the Gulf. The Blue commander said \"I have a feeling that Red is going to strike.\" (p. 135) However, \"his staff was quick to assure him that their ONA \\[Operational Net Assessment\\] made it clear that this could not happen.\" (p. 135)\n\n**While previous Red commanders had used their missiles in dribs and drabs, Van Riper used them all at once in a salvo, sinking 16 virtual ships and taking 20,000 virtual servicemen and women to the bottom. \"Only a few days in, the war was over, and the twenty-first century U.S. military had been beaten hands down.\" (p. 136) The brass responded to this reverse as the good bureaucrats they were, and Van Riper was told that the ships had been refloated by magic and the game would continue. To his credit, he quit in disgust. \"Afterward he wrote a scathing report, documenting how the exercise had been rigged and by whom, but no outsider could read it because it was promptly classified.\" (p. 136)\n\n**Before I read *Kill Chain*, I knew that the military was the main source of fraud, waste, and abuse in the government, if only because it has the only budget that doesn't receive effective oversight, and also because I observed fairly low level GS-9's receiving expensive trips. The Millennial Challenge, among all the other things that went wrong about the new generation of high-tech weapons, left me with a much more grim assessment: the military as it has come to be structured may well not be capable of fulfilling its basic duty of providing for the common defense.\n\n*\\[1\\]* Of course assassination is not permitted under Executive Order 11905, issued by Gerald Ford and reaffirmed by Carter and Reagan. However, \"Administration officials later explained to the *Washington Post* some of the ways in which the ban might not really ban assassinations, suggesting '... the order could be revoked or simply ignored, arguing that covert action against terrorists could be defended as something other than 'political assassination.\"\" (p. 90)\n\n*\\[2\\]* See, e.g., Robin Williams in *Toys.*\n\n*\\[3\\]* War games are essential to the development of military strategy. For example, war games in the 1930s showed that, after a Japanese attack, immediate retaliation against Japan itself would fail, while the island hopping strategy actually adopted would win.","order":5},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—December 2015 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"December 2015","order":-1,"date":"2015-12-02","body":"**Welcome to the December issue of the *Washington Socialist*, the monthly email newsletter of the Metro DC local of Democratic Socialists of America**.\n\nOur nine-member delegation returned in mid-November from the biannual national DSA convention and our recollections and responses are part of this newsletter, with more to come.

Many of us would like to steal these ideas for the US. The almost two-hour film gets a look at one dimension of life per country which is then compared to the US experience. Ironically some of their ideas came from the US but are not executed as well.\n\nItaly was one country viewed and its attention to worker morale and vacations is remarkable. Italian workers have eight weeks of vacation time when all time-offs and holidays are counted. They seem to have equivalent productivity as the U.S. An Italian CEO talks in a way that would be considered socialist by some in the U.S. The difference in political culture slaps you in the face!\n\nFinland often scores as having the best education system in the world and has a national law banning private schools. That is something to think about given the American experience with private schools and inequality. Also they have only twenty minutes of homework in high school. What is not covered is that Nokia's leaders could not grasp the importance of the iPhone until it smashed them. Great education does not always ensure vision by leaders.\n\nOne German experience covered is how they relate to their dark history. Plaques are placed on sidewalks marking where Jews were taken from their homes to death camps. Local artists are able to place signs noting events of Nazi history. Moore suggests how Americans might use this technique to point out slave markets, Indian massacres, and other parts of our history not always covered in textbooks.\n\nA major critique of the film is that it would work better as a TV mini-series where you could get a deeper look at the countries' governance and culture.\n\n\"Where to Invade Next\" may be coming out in the next month. It should be on the film list of democratic socialists and maybe encourage us to hear more of other countries' achievements so that we can steal them for ourselves. There is starting to be more discussion in DSA about how democratic socialism is defined and used in foreign countries. This film is a small taste but to be truly helpful we will have to delve deeper into how these countries function.\n\n*A film by Michael Moore — 110 minutes*"},{"title":"A Call to Action: Cornel West's Black Prophetic Fire","date":"2014-11-10","issue":"November 2014","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"On October 14, Cornel West spoke to a capacity crowd at the 5<sup>th</sup> and K Street Busboys and Poets bringing a message of hope and determination in the struggle for justice, a struggle that has grown sharper in recent years. The occasion was publication of West's new book, *Black Prophetic Fire* – an exploration of the contemporary relevance of the legacies left by Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells, W.E.B. DuBois, Ella Baker, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X. A set of dialogues with Christa Buschendorf (a German scholar at the University of Frankfurt/Main specializing in African-American studies), the work emphasizes how these figures championed a different, alternative conception of US democracy by uniting demands for racial and economic justice.\n\nRejecting the caricatures and simplifications by which history remembers them, West reminds us of the prophetic tradition – the \"Black Fire\" referred to in the title – within the African American community, a tradition which strove for liberation from the shackles of racism by positing a vision of human liberation. Each leader he discusses, in his or her own unique way, connected the dots that link the pervasive social and personal alienation inherent in a system of racial privilege to the exploitation and violence that pervades everyday life. Thus, as they spoke out and organized against the horrors of slavery, lynching, and segregation, they sought not acceptance into an oppressive system, but rather social transformation that would make society worthy of inclusion. Whether we look at the largely forgotten Ida B. Wells, whose pioneering role documenting the scourge of lynching served as a precursor to Progressive Era muckraking, or recall DuBois, whose towering intellectual importance has been placed in a corner by anti-Communism, dominant historical narratives leave out the substance of the struggles for equality that have been at the core of political struggles throughout our history.\n\nSo too, as West emphasizes, the false narrative that sets Malcolm X and King in opposition to each other becomes a means to avoid the similarity of their critiques of the underlying structural failings of US society, becomes a mechanism to reduce social struggles to the personality of charismatic leaders. Lost in such retellings of the past is the extraordinary role of \"ordinary\" working people whose courage and vision is what made the civil rights movement possible. Ella Baker embraced and embodied that recognition, her leadership role in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s undervalued by society's sexism and misunderstood by those unable to see that genuine leadership means organizing people to seize the moment themselves. Her emphasis was always and ever on grassroots activism, on making real a vision of participatory democracy – a legacy of particular importance today when people have been made to feel disempowered.\n\nAnd in a juxtaposition of that legacy and today's reality lies West's critique – an uncompromising critique — of the Obama Administration and of those liberals and progressives, especially political and intellectual leaders in the black community, who justify the President's actions. The presentation laid particular stress on the betrayal of the historic anti-war role of black leadership by Obama's reliance on war – his use of drones, of assassinations, of bombings – as a legitimate tool of foreign policy. This is in contrast to DuBois who – when over 80 years old — was handcuffed and arrested because of his refusal to back down from peace activism, and it is in contrast to King – who broke with Lyndon Johnson, with the AFL-CIO, with \"respectable\" civil rights leaders — by denouncing the war in Vietnam, by denouncing US violence abroad in all its forms. West reminded us of the need to remember King for the radical he became, rejecting the \"santaclausifed\" version of his convictions by media and politicians alike. King did not only condemn the war, he challenged too the belief that the US has nothing to learn from the rest of the world — the chauvinistic pretension that has rationalized the imperial foreign policy of Clinton and Obama alike.\n\nArrogance over the supposed moral virtues of the US vis-à-vis the rest of the world of necessity must gloss over the cruelties and hypocrisies of our criminal justice system, a connection West makes again and again. Eric Holder's unwillingness to indict Bush Administration torturers presaged the Justice Department's subsequent refusal to prosecute the corporate criminals responsible for the 2008 financial collapse. That collapse had a particularly devastating impact on the black community; the class bias in prosecutorial policy as in economic policy has strengthened inequality between rich and working people, and intensified the gap between black and white. West used this analysis to reinforce his point that a direct confrontation with racism is essential to overcome all forms of social and economic injustice, that failure to do the one leads to failure to do the other. He made that point too by noting that the other side of the Obama Administration's unwillingness to prosecute law-breaking bankers has been its unwillingness to end the \"war on drugs,\" with its victimization of people of color, its unwillingness to end the discriminatory and inhumane practice of deportation of immigrants.\n\nThe picture painted might have been bleak. West acknowledged that he wrote *Black Prophetic Fire* out of concern that the tradition of black radicalism was being undermined by support for Obama's politics of accommodation. His presentation, however, was given in another spirit altogether, fueled by the hopefulness of renewal in the mass protests in Ferguson. Just returned from there, where he had been arrested in a civil disobedience protest, West saw in the town's black youth – and in the support they have received from across the country — a revival of mass movements rooted in and growing out of the experience of the marginalized and dispossessed, breathing new winds to fan the flames of discontent, bringing forth a new vision of what society could be.\n\nWest's talk struck a chord in that capacity crowd – a crowd that he challenged by urging them to reject the easy path of acceptance and instead give content to their individual lives by seeking the harder path of challenge and commitment. He called on all to act and thereby contribute to ending the cycle of war, racism and exploitation that has defined too much of our nation's history. Absent, however, was a sense of how to bring such change into being. That, of course, was not the purpose of West's talk or his book; he sees his role in presenting a public challenge by speaking truths that too many in positions of influence refuse to acknowledge. Nonetheless, the challenge of how to turn words into deeds is one that has to be accepted. Each of the persons discussed in *Black Prophetic Fire* strove always to maintain a balance between radicalism and engagement.\n\nThe need to condemn liberal accommodation with power while also focusing fire on right-wing forces that seek to dismantle liberal values is a challenge that faced the abolitionist movement, the democratic advance of the Reconstruction years, the highly contradictory Progressivism of the turn of the century before last, and the dynamics of both the New Deal and Civil Rights struggles. This is the challenge facing DSA – West serving as one of our Honorary Chairs – as it is the challenge facing the left as a whole in all its forms. The legacy of engagement that doesn't surrender a genuine radicalism, the legacy of a radicalism based on the hopes, dreams and actions of working people, of a radicalism that builds unity by directly challenging racism and all forms of oppression is the legacy of Douglass, Wells, DuBois, Baker, King and Malcolm that West brought to light. It is a legacy to use in building the movement for peace, justice, equality and freedom, in the building of a socialist movement today.\n\n[*Global Green New Deal\" Provides Focus for Oct. 11 General Meeting*](http://dsadc.org/global-green-new-deal-provides-focus-for-oct-11-general-meeting/)\n\nMonday, November 10th, 2014\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;* November 2014**\n\n*By Andy Feeney*\n\nA warning that time is rapidly running out on efforts to control global climate change, coupled with hope that a Global Green New Deal to accomplish the necessary energy transition could bring about better lives for almost everyone, were two of the main messages that Dr. David Schwartzman, a professor emeritus at Howard University, delivered to the Metro DC DSA general membership meeting held on Oct. 11.\n\nThe meeting drew 14 attendees, several of whom were new to DSA. It was mostly focused on Schwartzman's somewhat abbreviated presentation of [*an extensive PowerPoint*](http://www.redandgreen.org/Documents/David/Schwartzman_GND.pdf) he has created on the climate crisis and the need for \"eco-socialist revolution\" to counter it.\n\nIn his presentation, Schwartzman departed significantly from the positions that many radical environmentalists have taken on the need for an end to global economic growth and total growth in human energy consumption to bring climate change under control. He argued instead that for all of humanity to achieve a \"state of the art/science\" quality of life now enjoyed by people in the wealthiest capitalist countries as well as Cuba, whose average expected lifespan now approaches that of the capitalist West, total energy consumption worldwide must grow from 18 terawatts or TW – i.e., 18 quadrillion watts – annually, with is its current level, to some 25 TW in the future. This would average out to a minimum of about 3.5 kilowatts per person of energy consumption per year.\n\nHowever, Schwartzman argued, with adequate investments in wind power, in ever-more-efficient solar photovoltaic cells and in concentrated solar thermal power plants located in places like the Sahara Desert, \"a global-scale transition can be achieved in no more than 30 years, ending with zero anthropogenic carbon emissions\" – i.e. with zero emissions of carbon from human economic activities.\n\nTo achieve this goal, he said, the world would need to invest roughly 1-2 percent of our current annual energy consumption, about 85 percent of which currently comes from fossil fuels, in the development of wind and solar power sources each year. Once the necessary investments were made, however, annual energy consumption needs would drop, and timely investments in energy conservation and energy efficiency would help speed the transition.\n\nAs Schwartzman sees the shift from our current world economy – dependent on a \"Military Industrial Fossil Fuel Nuclear State Terror and Surveillance Complex\" or \"MIC\"— to a sustainable world order in which an extensive military apparatus is not required to protect western capitalism's access to fossil fuels, it would require that total energy consumption decreased in the United States and in some other highly carbon-dependent countries. At the same time, however, energy consumption – and possibly even fossil fuel consumption – would need to increase in many of the poorer nations of the world that now suffer from too little energy consumption and shorter average lifespans.\n\nIn addition to energy consumption rising in order to enable all societies to achieve state of the art living standards, additional energy consumption would be needed to clean up the pollution and other kinds of environmental damage caused by the MIC over the past several centuries, to repair infrastructure projects around the world and to establish Green Cities, Schwartzman said. Still more energy must be invested in the sequestering or removal of carbon from the atmosphere through the use of solar technologies and \"agroecology\" technologies such as permaculture.\n\nThe development of solar and wind energy technologies and a turn from industrial agricultural methods that are highly depended on fossil fuels to permaculture and other forms of agroecology that are environmentally sustainable will in themselves help to promote eco-socialist revolution by undermining the MIC and radically altering existing technologies, somewhat as Marx predicted long ago in discussing the revolutionary nature of capitalist technology, Schwartzman suggested.\n\nIn addition to breaking with some forms of radical environmental thinking, however, his vision for a Global Green New Deal also departs from what some eco-socialists have written on the subject of climate change. For example, in *Monthly Review* magazine and in his book *The Ecological Rift*, eco-socialist John Bellamy Foster has repeatedly argued against the idea that \"green capitalism\" can bring about a transition to a sustainable economy. In his PowerPoint presentation to DSA, Schwartzman indicated that green capitalism and market forces alone will not do the job, but added the prevention of catastrophic climate *change* or C3 \"must begin now!\" – a fact that will require some cooperation with green capitalist entrepreneurs, or at least no attempts to block them.\n\nThe development of an eco-socialist transition to a sustainable world economy will require \"multidimensional class struggle\" at every level of society, from the classroom to the planet, and will require and draw on actions against every form of oppression, whether based in class or on race, ethnicity, religion, differing degrees of ability or age, Schwartzman stated. As part of that multidimensional class struggle, eco-socialists need to make \"alliances, albeit temporary, with so-called green capital\" to undermine and isolate the MIC complex.\n\nHumanity has very little time remaining to launch a Global Green New Deal, the PowerPoint presentation suggested. Climate scientist James Hansen has stated that a rise of 2 degrees Centigrade above global pre-industrial average temperatures is the limit of what can occur without severe risks of triggering climate-related disasters, and most researchers agree that to achieve an average temperature rise of just 2 degrees C, the loading of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere must be brought down to no more than 350 ppm. The current level is more than 400 ppm. Studies cited in Schwartzman's presentation have concluded that heading off truly dangerous climate change will require drastic reductions in current levels of CO2 emissions within four or five years – a goal that the nations of the earth are nowhere near to reaching as of today.\n\nNevertheless, Schwartzman concluded, this warning \"must be coupled with hope.\" The hope lies in the fact that an effective program to curb CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in \"a much better life for all\" in the form of the Global Green New Deal, \"with the capacity to deliver clean air and clean water, organic food, meaningful employment and more free creative time for all on this planet.\"\n\nA lively discussion followed, which continued somewhat past the meeting's official closing time.

Democrats","date":"2014-11-10","issue":"November 2014","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"Marylanders awoke to a strange landscape on Nov. 5 – one with a quite unexpected Republican victor in the governor's race. Larry Hogan's one-note campaign on taxes appeared to have registered with many Maryland voters, especially white working-class Democrats from outside the Democratic strongholds of Baltimore City and Prince George's and Montgomery counties.\n\nBut those voters on the Eastern Shore and in Southern and Western Maryland may have been easier to nudge, taxes aside, because the Democratic candidate, Anthony Brown, would have been the state's first African American governor. Hogan's task was also eased [*because those Democratic strongholds had poor turnout*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/campaign-2014/bs-md-how-hogan-won-20141105-story.html) in the non-presidential year.\n\nThe *Baltimore Sun*'s Michael Dresser reported \"In Baltimore \\[City\\], about 35,000 fewer voters turned out than four years ago — and Brown won a smaller percentage of the city vote than Gov. Martin O'Malley did then. Some 50,000 fewer people voted in Montgomery this time, and 30,000 fewer in Brown's home county of Prince George's.\" That roughly 115,000-vote shortfall goes a long way toward explaining Hogan's 76,000-vote margin of victory.\n\nThe tax issue is fast becoming \\[in urban legend\\] the issue that sank Brown and elected Hogan – even in the *New Yorker,* which in a gazing-from-afar piece by Kelefah Sannah recycled some conventional wisdom, bought the GOP's anti-tax frame and concluded that Democrats have given voters \"the sense that Democratic politicians don't hate taxes as much as they do.\"\n\nDemocrats retained their overwhelming advantage in the General Assembly, in contrast to Brown's fortunes statewide. But in a year when one-third of all delegate seats were open due to retirements or attempts at different offices, Republicans scrapped for advantage statewide and added two seats in the Senate and seven in the House of Delegates. Some ongoing progressive campaigns for legislation may be emperiled.\n\nThe champion and sponsor of the Earned Sick Leave bill, John Olszewski, tried to move up from his delegate seat in increasingly Republican Baltimore County into an open Senate seat vacated by the retirement of Sen. Norman Stone. He lost to GOP candidate Johnny Salling, and his district became solidly GOP as all three delegate seats went Republican, including of course his former seat. At least one other Democratic delegate, Mary-Dulany James of Harford County, also tried to trade up to an open Senate seat from which a Republican had retired, but also lost; the Democrats dropped from 35 of 47 to 33 of 47 seats in the upper chamber. A veto-proof majority was, however, retained, giving the Democrats a considerable lever against the new executive's power to dictate the terms of the state budget.\n\nJolene Ivey, a Prince George's delegate who left her seat to run for lieutenant governor, was also a strong and influential advocate for the sick leave bill, which will be introduced for the third time in the 2015 session. Advocates of the bill will be searching for new champions. Ivey was the running mate of Doug Gansler, the former attorney general who unsuccessfully challenged Brown for the Democratic gubernatorial nod.\n\nStill, labor and social justice advocates are somewhat upbeat. One veteran top labor staffer recalled that a fighting spirit was kindled in House Speaker Mike Busch and Senate President Mike Miller by the ideological fervor of Bob Ehrlich, the last Republican governor. \"We got more bills passed \\[in Ehrlich's four years\\] than with Democrats... we couldn't write bills fast enough.\"\n\nLikewise, Chesapeake Climate Action Network director Mike Tidwell argued that the climate change movement in the state should greet the electoral setback by \"going on offense \\[and\\] double down\" on the effort, planning a campaign to statutorily increase the percentage of renewables in the state's energy mix from 20 percent to 40 percent in the next decade, as well as to keep fracking of natural gas out of Maryland. At a Sierra Club legislative briefing Saturday, Nov. 8, state activists agreed on those priorities among others, though cautious about how committee assignments might develop with so many new delegates.\n\nTransit and smart growth activists in the D.C. suburbs are concerned about the fate of the Purple Line light rail that would connect Montgomery and Prince George's. Hogan has suggested he would rather spend the money on roads. His running mate, former federal (G.W. Bush) and Maryland (Ehrlich) cabinet minion Boyd Rutherford[*, said in the lieutenant governors' candidates' one debate*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-lt-governor-debate-20141016-story.html) \"No Purple Line, not at this particular time .... I would not lose sleep if it was canceled completely, put it that way.\"\n\nThe Purple Line has David Alpert in \"Greater Greater Washington\"... \"If Hogan kills the \\[Purple Line\\] project, he'll be turning down likely federal dollars that won't go to other Maryland priorities, and he'll be disappointing many voters in a much more visceral way than under Ehrlich.\"\n\nHe goes on to quote another activist: \"David Moon, an organizer who once ran the Purple Line Now campaign and was just elected to the House of Delegates from the Silver Spring/Takoma Park area, said, 'You're not going to be able to \\[win Hogan over\\] from a regional DC-suburban perspective, or a liberal transit versus roads perspective,\" or the environment (he ran against a stormwater fee calling it a \"rain tax\").' But if businesses are willing to stand up for infrastructure that will generate economic growth, he said, that is more compelling.\n\nAlpert points out that Virginia's business community, though low-tax advocates, nevertheless support building new infrastructure, much of the most recent happening in a generally Republican political environment. Will Maryland's business community bring that message to Hogan? Some \"businesspeople remain focused on tax rates and only tax rates as the only factor behind economic competitiveness,\" Alpert wrote. \"But study after study has shown that millennials are not looking for the cheapest place to live; they want a desirable one (that's affordable, but usually it's scarce real estate, not taxes, that make it unaffordable).\n\n\"Tax rates matter, but so does infrastructure. The Purple Line would boost Montgomery County, the state of Maryland, and the region. The Red Line would do the same for Baltimore. It would be short-sighted and not fiscally prudent to cancel these projects.\" The *WaPo*'s first editorial exhortation to Hogan, delivered only three days after the election, sounded this note. But will Hogan hear that from business allies (other than the pathetically pro-corporate *WaPo*, that is)?\n\nThe new governor's very earliest personnel moves were ominous. Lt. Gov.-elect Rutherford joins a veteran of both Bob Ehrlich and Parris Glendening transition teams, [*Jim Brady*](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-02-28/business/bal-qa0228_1_james-t-brady-edf-group-constellation-energy), as Hogan's two-person transition team. Brady is not a reassuring figure either; he worked for the Democrat, Glendening, in the '90s as secretary of economic and business development but broke with the then-governor over his opposition to the wretched Inter-County Connector and became a Republican – a serious move in Maryland, where many Democrats are pro-business Republicans in spirit but stick with the dominant political culture. Brady is now a consultant and seat-warmer on corporate boards including the rapacious Constellation Energy, boding ill for environmental and alternative energy concerns during the transition and especially if he joins the administration.\n\nA Chesapeake Climate Action Network organizer told a crowd in Greenbelt the night after the election that the next governor \"doesn't believe in climate change or the science behind it.\" Problems for the renewable portfolio standard upgrade, for continued resistance to fracking in Maryland, bay cleanup and the offshore wind project are likely; at the very least, any partnerships with the private sector (for instance, the offshore wind project) will likely be much more to developers' advantage than (even) under O'Malley.\n\nMetro DC DSA steering committee member Kurt Stand in Cheverly reports \"Despite the many defeats registered in the mid-term elections in Maryland, some gains were made in Prince George's County. Alongside Senator Victor Ramirez,District 47a elected former Colmar Manor Mayor Diana Fennell and longtime union activist Jimmy Tarlau as delegates; the three agreeing to work as a team. In a letter to supporters, written under the heading 'A Bittersweet Election Day,' Tarlau explained that his initial focus will be on developing a progressive caucus to last the long-haul. He added, 'I know that it will be more difficult to get things accomplished with a Republican governor, but I did not think getting progressive legislation passed and signed into law would be easy with a Democratic governor either. It will take a movement pressuring legislators to get good things passed, and encouraging more union members and other activists to run for political office. There are no shortcuts.' \"\n\nAlternative parties were active in this Maryland election. A libertarian candidate for governor polled near double digits. In Montgomery's Takoma-Silver Spring legislative district, Green Party candidate Dan Robinson polled a very respectable 9-plus percent, but trailed newcomer-winner David Moon, running as a Democrat. Green candidate Tim Willard, in a Montgomery County Council at-large race crowded with candidates including progressive stalwart Marc Elrich, was less successful at 2 percent. Tom Hucker, a former leader of Progressive Maryland and two-term delegate, tried successfully for a council seat in Montgomery.\n\nPrince George's had only two competitive County Council races and remains business-friendly with the exceptions of Mary Lehman, an incumbent, and Danielle Glaros, who secured the seat of outgoing progressive Eric Olson, for who she was chief of staff. Deni Tavares, a protégé of Sen. Victor Ramirez, also won a council seat and arrives with progressive credentials but her future depends on her not being absorbed into the overall pro-development culture of the rest of the council.\n\nBoth of DC's suburban counties have African-American county executives who talk a progressive game but have had a hard time shaking free of the pro-development culture, as well. Rushern Baker was unopposed in Prince George's and Ike Leggett cruised easily past a Republican challenger in Montgomery. Montgomery tends to extract more concessions from their developers than does Prince George's, but a commitment to public works for public goods is – in keeping with the current age and culture – less common in either than is healthy for governance. The degree to which both jurisdictions fight for the Purple Line and other overtly public activities under a Republican governor will reveal much.","order":2},{"title":"IN MOSTLY DISMAL DC ELECTION RESULTS, SOME HOPE FOR PROGRESSIVES","date":"2014-11-10","issue":"November 2014","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Given the outcome of the Nov. 4 DC local election that mostly affirmed the status quo, one has to look beneath the surface to find a sliver of hope for more progressive politics in DC. Nevertheless there are positive signs in a mostly bleak landscape.\n\nSurely the results at the top of the ballot were nothing to cheer about, with Democrat Muriel Bowser cruising to victory by 19 percentage points over David Catania. Many thought Catania would at least make the race close, but in the end Bowser's identity as a Democrat and African American trumped that of the white, openly gay and Republican-turned-independent Catania. Carol Schwartz, another independent who was once Republican, didn't muster enough votes to even play spoiler. The race was full of style and mostly devoid of substance, with the sharp differences in personality between the top three candidates masking what was largely a void of distinction between their platforms. All three were largely business-friendly moderates with liberal stances on social issues. With so little on the line, Metro-DC DSA took a pass on endorsing anyone for mayor, and DC voters went with the safe choice.\n\nThe sound and fury of the mayoral race almost drowned out more interesting down-ballot contests. The most contentious was the race for at-large councilmember, with 15 candidates vying for two seats. It was foreordained that the Democrat, Anita Bonds, would win one of the seats, and she did with 24 percent of the overall vote despite her lackluster record and absence of nearly any significant endorsements (except from her fellow Democratic officeholders) or enthusiasm among voters for her. The real contest was for the second seat, one reserved for a non-Democrat. Metro-DC DSA endorsed and campaigned for two candidates running explicitly left-progressive platforms: Eugene Puryear of the Statehood Green Party and Graylan Hagler, running as an independent. Despite vigorous campaigns by both, Puryear finished sixth with 3.5 percent of the vote, and Hagler seventh with 3.0. Winning the second seat, formerly held by Catania, was Elissa Silverman, formerly a reporter for the *Washington Post* and *Washington City Paper*, with 12 percent.\n\nPuryear's and Hagler's finishes are disappointing, but DSA members can take heart that Silverman branded herself as a progressive, albeit one who appealed more to newer (and whiter) DC residents. While Puryear and Hagler emphasized issues of greater concern to long-time and lower-income DC residents, such as affordable housing, job creation and fairness for returning citizens, Silverman ran on a good-government platform that highlighted eliminating corporate contributions to local candidates and improving transportation. Silverman captured many of the voters who were partial to Tommy Wells, outgoing councilmember and unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for mayor, who embraced the \"livable, walkable\" vision of DC favored by younger, upwardly mobile migrants to the city. In addition, she started her campaign with more name recognition than most of the candidates, having run in last year's special election for Council that was won by Bonds.\n\nThe fact that candidates feel the need to advertise themselves as progressives – at one point, Catania even argued he and not Bowser was the real progressive in the race – bespeaks of a DC where progressive politics matter and voters on the left need to at least be appeased, if not actively catered to. A Bowser administration, and the new Council that will work with her, will be heavily influenced by developers and other wealthy interests with business before the city. But they will go to great lengths not to appear to be in the pockets of the wealthy, and it is this fact that gives DSA and other progressive organizations a voice, if not genuine leverage. Likewise, the four Democrats who won easy election to four Council seats to represent Wards 1, 3,5 and 6 all identify as liberal-to-progressive, though it will be the duty of real progressives to hold their feet the fire on the issues.\n\nWe also can take heart that two genuine progressive (and DSA-endorsed) candidates won easy re-election: Eleanor Holmes Norton as delegate to Congress and Phil Mendelson as chair of the DC Council. We can take somewhat less solace that Karl Racine, a partner in the corporate law firm Venable, will become the first elected DC attorney general. The DC political establishment lined up behind Racine to snuff out the candidacies of more feisty, independent-minded candidates such as labor-friendly Edward \"Smitty\" Smith, DC voting-rights advocate Lorie Masters and Paul Zukerberg, whose lawsuit forced the election to happen in the first place.\n\nThe overwhelming \"yes\" vote in the initiative to fully legalize marijuana is also a victory for social-justice advocates. Backers of the initiative framed it as a matter of racial and economic justice, given the fact that minority and low-income communities have borne the brunt of arrests and convictions for marijuana possession although its use is well-distributed among ethnicities and social classes.\n\nThere are other possibilities for liberals and progressives. With Silverman replacing Catania, the Council's center of gravity moves just a bit to the left, given her priority of reducing the influence of corporate cash in local elections. In addition, the proposed transfer of the Reeves Center to developers as part of a deal for a new soccer stadium could get heightened scrutiny, given Bowser's professed skepticism of the idea.\n\nThe next step is for DSA and other progressive organizations who played a role in the election to turn lemons into lemonade – to use the energy generated by the outspoken but unsuccessful Puryear and Hagler campaigns, and the clear desire among most DC voters for a government that represents the majority and not top 1 percent, to build a left political force that will capture not only hearts but enough votes for victory.\n\n[*Socialism's development in Africa traced at Salon*](http://dsadc.org/socialisms-development-in-africa-traced-at-salon/)\n\nMonday, November 10th, 2014\n\n\n\n***The Washington Socialist** &lt;&gt;* **November 2014**\n\n*By Woody Woodruff*\n\nIn the heady decades when African nations shook off the colonial yoke and established indigenous rule, radical ideas struggled to get traction in an environment of big-power Cold War competition – and of reflexive resistance to those ideas, including socialism and Marxism, that Africans associated with the colonial powers.\n\nFigures like Kwame Nkrumah and Julius Nyerere were frequently stymied in their attempts to bring a version of socialism to new nations still pummeled by extractive exploitation of resources, as DSA members heard from Nicole Gerber at the October Socialist Salon. Gerber, recently returned from Guinea, explained how deep local culture and lingering hatred of colonial influence complicated the natural flowering of radical ideas in societies newly able to seek their own paths.\n\nGerber outlined the varied pattern of nationalist models as one former colony after the other gained independence during the middle of the last century. Many icons of African liberation were radicals and/or socialists, and many of those had been educated in the West. But strong currents of African identity and mistrust of Western politics, theory and values complicated their attempts to fashion political structures that would work with the economic conditions of post-colonial nations.\n\nNationalist sensibilities were also pulled two ways, Gerber noted. What's often described as a divisive tribalism is said to have fractured national ties that were the residua of boundaries imposed by imperial powers. Gerber observed that tribal divides were often in fact economic class divides. In the opposite direction, many of the early leaders of the new nations subscribed to varying degrees to PanAfricanist ideals that asserted there would be no progress without continental unity in the face of external threats of imperialism and capitalist exploitation.\n\nGerber's discussion was complemented by documents she furnished on request to Salon participants. They displayed the spectrum of socialist and other ideals held by leaders of the independence era. Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, for instance, got his socialism studying at Edinburgh University but was the originator of \"*ujamaa*,\" a communitarian socialism he asserted was rooted in precolonial African social practice. \"...communal ownership of land is traditional in our country-it was the concept of freehold which had been foreign to them,\" he said in *Essays on Socialism* (1977). Kwame Nkrumah, who led colonial Gold Coast to become Ghana, was educated in the US. He similarly cited a precolonial golden age: \"We know that the traditional African society was founded on principles of egalitarianism. In its actual workings, however, it had various shortcomings. Its humanist impulse, nevertheless, is something that continues to urge us towards our all-African socialist reconstruction.\" Nkrumah, like Nyerere a PanAfricanist, asserted \"the economic development of the continent must be planned and pursued as a whole. A loose confederation designed only for economic co-operation would not provide the necessary unity of purpose.\"\n\nPatrice Lumumba was a longtime agitator for freedom of the Belgian Congo and presided briefly over national liberation, but in less than a year was ousted and then murdered by dissident forces associated with the mineral-rich secessionist region of Katanga, probably with the complicity of Western mining interests and of the US CIA. His enormous new nation, he warned, could be troubled by just such fragmenting: \"\"I ask you all to sink your tribal quarrels: they weaken us and may cause us to be despised abroad,\" he said at his inaugural.\n\nSekou Toure, who was the longtime strongman of Guinea, brought socialist ideas and perhaps ideals to the liberation struggle but was called a \"hardliner\" by many and \"hero and tyrant\" by one biographer. He was for years before assuming power a labor leader and his ability to keep labor quiescent appeared important to his longevity in power, far outlasting his allies Lumumba and Nkrumah. Both Nyerere and Nkrumah resorted to suppressing labor unions later in their tenures, and the strife that caused is credited by some with their eventual loss of power. Amilcar Cabral, a theoretician of Guinea-Bissau, was also steeped in labor activism and that conditioned his influential strategic writing, where Frantz Fanon, a psychiatrist, was more inclined to a Mao-like faith in peasant activism, in an Algeria where French colonists were there to stay and dominated the bourgeois and working-class culture.\n\nGerber's account and the discussion that followed traced some of the crosscurrents of African liberation movements' and leaders' struggle to adapt socialist principles to the realities of post-colonial Africa.\n\n\n\n*The Socialist Salon, generally held at 6:30 p.m. the third Thursday of the month at a local restaurant, is an opportunity for DSA members and others to explore and share radical ideas, themes, traditions and solutions in an informal setting.

They retained their three House representatives partly because gerrymandering made it difficult to lose even though the turnout was only 37 percent.\n\nSenator Mark Warner won his dramatic election. When he ran in 2008, Warner got 65 percent of the vote as opposed to the 49 percent he got this time. The senator's commitment to bipartisanship and mild support of more progressive issues may not have allowed him to mobilize his base as some of his staff urged. The political environment has changed since 2008.\n\nThe electorate is focused on their lack of economic gains, and when Democrats like Sen. Warner do not seem to answer these concerns they are losing votes big time. When 63 percent of respondents in a CNN poll believe that the economy is favoring the rich, a call to bipartisanship and compromise may seem like surrender. Over 60 percent of Americans believe the minimum wage needs to be raised but there is not a national Democratic push for this. The hope for the future is that the Democratic Party must begin to take on inequality or lose more voters.\n\nThe Independent Green Party (IG) made a great show by receiving over 30,000 votes. The Libertarian Party got 47,000 votes. The IG party was influenced by the German Green Party when some military members were based in Germany.

A slack Democratic effort at the top and a collapse of turnout in Dem strongholds yielded a Republican governor, with interesting implications in a state where the General Assembly remains nominally deep blue but, yep, ensorcelled by business interests too.

Frantz Fanon, the Afro-French psychiatrist and author of *Wretched of the Earth* (gleaned from the Algerian independence struggle), developed the insight that real liberation, and the practice that proceeds from it, has to be *taken*, seized violently or lovingly, by the subject, rather than having it conferred on her or him. The US voter, separated by several generations from the last broad-scale struggle for the vote, appears to suffer from the uncertainty about political and social constraints (or lack of them) that comes from not having actively *taken* the form of liberation available. The inability to see one's own complicity in, and bondage by, capitalism may come from the absence of this critical step. The threat posed by the new and more subtle strategies being employed in many states to contain and reduce the votes of poor and disadvantaged people many revive this sense, one hopes.\n\nMeanwhile, at our October membership meeting, David Schwartzman of our kindred organization Committees of Correspondence for Democratic Socialism laid out a radical vision of solutions to the looming *uber*-problem of climate change. Noting that many proposed paths to lowering carbon emissions largely tinker with the existing growth-driven global corporate-capitalist regime, Schwartzman argued instead that a proper solution must \"end the rule of capital on the planet.\" Andy Feeney provides a fuller account of Schwartzman's presentation and backstory.

The need to respond to membership interest or community need often puts causes and organizations in separate tracks of action, looking after their own without direct engagement with the issues of others. It is this narrowness that lies behind the success of neo-liberalism dating back to the Reagan era, and the ability of a corporate minority to define our nation's political agenda. It was the recognition of the need to break out of that box by building mutual support between various union and social justice organizing initiatives that led some AFL-CIO affiliates to found Jobs with Justice in 1987 as an independent network of locally-based labor-community coalitions – including in Washington DC.\n\nA living wage for all, wage theft for none, demands for immigrant rights and the right for all workers to organize – the breadth of accomplishments being celebrated at [*DC Jobs With Justice 12<sup>th</sup> Annual \"I'll Be There Awards\"*](http://http:/www.dcjwj.org/events/12th-annual-ill-be-there-awards/) celebration is a reflection of the interconnection of struggles with which the organization is engaged. The event will be held on Thursday, June 12, at AFL-CIO, 815 16<sup>th</sup> Street NW, between 6:00 – 8:00 pm honoring two individuals and two organizations that reflect the values and commitment at the heart of JWJ's work. The names and some of the arenas of engagement of each awardee tell the story of those values and commitments. Alya Solomon, formerly of the Metro DC Labor Council, played a critical role in the successful campaign to raise the minimum wage, and in the ongoing campaign to pass legislation granting all workers paid sick days. Her work embraced meeting the needs of private and public sector workers, defending union members facing unfair treatment, and initiatives to create more union jobs. Reverend Graylan Hagler, the Senior Minister at Plymouth Congregational United Church of Christ, who has served as UNITE HERE Local 25 chaplain, currently directs Faith Strategies, an interfaith group that brings together labor and community concerns – concerns manifested in efforts to ensure that Walmart treats workers and consumers fairly, to ensure patient safety and safe staffing at DC hospitals, reclaim quality public education for all students, and to end deportations.\n\nAlso being honored is *Sasha Bruce Youthwork,* an organization that has worked for decades amongst teens, including homeless youth, and expanded it to youth-adult worker-rights advocacy by joining with the Washington Interfaith Network, the DC Jobs Council, and DC JWJ in several campaigns, including that in defense of public transit and for a living wage. They have also been engaged in initiatives to end hiring discrimination against people with criminal histories; in particular supporting legislation to \"Ban the Box,\" – the box referring to the part of a job application which asks potential new hires about their criminal history, s an impediment to employment for individuals after they have served a prison sentence. Finally, there is *Trabajadores Unidos de Washington,* which developed out of an organizing project at various day laborer hiring sites around DC and has developed as an independent organization that has won wage theft victories against employers that failed to pay workers the pay they had earned, the granting of drivers licenses without regard to citizenship, and abolition of the anti-immigrant \"Secure Communities,\" which was designed to use local law enforcement to aid and abet deportations.\n\nListing the accomplishments of *Alya Solomon*, *Reverend Graylan Hagler, Sasha Bruce Youthwork* and *Trabajadores Unidos de Washington* speaks to the breadth of DC JWJ's concerns and the way it implements its program of mutual support. In addition to supporting diverse initiatives and campaigns, JWJ has been holding meetings to develop an anchor campaign – which will shortly be announced — that will bring together the concerns of as many of its constituencies as possible. This form of organizing that pulls unique concerns together rather than building coalitions based on the lowest common denominator (and thus ignoring the concern of many, particularly the most marginalized) has been an element in DSA's approach to building alternative politics throughout our history – which is why Metro DC DSA is one of the 60 member organizations of DC JWJ. This is all the more reason why members should attend the **\"I'll Be There Awards\"** on June 12 – as an act of solidarity and as a means of furthering our own engagement in working-class social justice struggles. Divide-and-conquer politics will only be overcome when all organizing unites particular needs with general interests; that is the way to unite equality with rights, justice with freedom.","order":0},{"title":"\"Dog Whistle Politics\": How Silence on Racial Justice Helps the Right","date":"2014-06-01","issue":"June 2014","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"**Review of *Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class* by Ian Haney Lopez. Oxford University Press, 2014, 230 pp.**\n\n\n\nBarack Obama's election to the presidency in 2008 gave hope to many liberal-to-progressive Americans that the post-racial era had truly arrived, or at least was within sight. Did the election of an African American president portend a new era where the nation could put the legacy of race behind it? Perhaps then it would be possible to build a united progressive movement where racial divisions no longer prevent class unity.\n\nAlas, as we now know, race and racism are very much still with us. In *Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class,* Ian Haney Lopez makes a compelling case that racial politics are only growing more pernicious, exploited by the right to advance an agenda favoring corporations and the wealthy. Liberals and the left, meanwhile, in avoiding the issue of race, offer no opposition to right-wing race-baiting. Obama himself has consistently avoided emphasizing his race or using his office to promote race-specific remedies – in large part, Lopez says, *because* of his race, to avoid being marginalized at a \"black\" president.\n\nLopez defines using a dog whistle as \"speaking in code to a target audience,\" using language that would resonate with the target group but that would lack salience to the larger public – much a literal dog whistle is audible only to dogs. Groups across the political spectrum use \"dog whistle\" language to communicate to their in-crowds (heaven knows socialists often speak in jargon unintelligible to the general public). In Haney's usage, \"dog whistle politics\" refers to \"coded talk centered on race\" that would be offensive if expressed in explicit racial terms. Hence the right uses rhetoric excoriating such targets as welfare cheats, predatory criminals and drug dealers that registers in the ears of their white audiences as referring to racial minorities, although no racial terms are used. When challenged, the \"whistlers\" stoutly deny any charges of racial bias and turn charges of racism back on their accusers.\n\nThe goal of dog whistle politics is not racial oppression itself, but rather to attack programs that benefit the wider middle and working classes and to promote the conservative agenda of lower taxes, reduced regulation, attacks on worker rights and the like. By connecting such liberal programs as health care, public education and income support in the public mind to \"undeserving minorities,\" the right can fan opposition to these programs among whites of modest means, even though many of these programs benefit them as well. Thus, racial solidarity trumps class interests to the detriment of most Americans.\n\nDog-whistle rhetoric enjoys a long history. After open discrimination on the basis of race began to break down after the Supreme Court's *Brown vs. Board of Education* decision banning school segregation, southern racists employed the coded term \"states' rights\" as their defense against federally mandated desegregation. Barry Goldwater used racially coded language in his 1964 presidential campaign, which was refined for Richard Nixon's \"Southern Strategy\" and developed further in Ronald Reagan's attacks on \"welfare queens\" and affirmative action.\n\nDog-whistle politics reached full fruition during George H.W. Bush's 1988 race against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the ads featuring Willie Horton, the Massachusetts convict on a weekend furlough who stabbed and bound a man and raped his fiancée. Bush's ads never employed specific racial terms, but the images of Horton, an African American, got the message across, helped Bush paint Dukakis as soft on crime and send the Democrat to defeat.\n\nWhile white voters' response to racial appeals often undercuts their economic interests, Lopez argues that their behavior is not necessarily irrational. The advancement of racial minorities' interests threatens their social and economic status, stoking fears that minorities will take their jobs or cause their property values to fall. Many lower-income whites feel that efforts to improve the lot of minorities, such as school and residential integration, have made them the guinea pigs for social experiments, while wealthy whites float above the fray in their private schools and pricy, exclusive neighborhoods.\n\nLopez cites studies showing that while many whites are susceptible to coded racial language, explicit race-based appeals turn them off. For instance, after the Willie Horton ads had badly wounded Dukakis, Jesse Jackson condemned them for their racial pandering. After Jackson spoke up, support for Bush declined, although not enough to cost him the victory. Likewise, Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott suffered a rapid fall after he publicly waxed nostalgic about Sen. Strom Thurmond's segregation-based 1948 presidential campaign.\n\nLopez makes a compelling argument that racial resentments were a major, if not the major, factor in the rapid rise of the reactionary, nearly all-white Tea Party movement after Obama's election. \"The fire that put so many Tea Partiers into the streets in 2009 and into the voting booths in 2010 was a fury at Obama himself . . .The contradictions others have noted in the Tea Party, so difficult to resolve without reference to race, become intelligible when looked at through the lens of dog whistle politics,\" he writes.\n\nThe solution for liberals, then, is to stop avoiding discussion of race. Rather, it is time to talk openly about how America's history of slavery and Jim Crow produced a society in which African Americans, Latinos and other minorities continue to be disadvantaged. Such a frank discussion, Lopez maintains, is a necessary precondition to uniting working-class and middle-class Americans around an economic program that will challenge the privileges of the wealthy.\n\nLopez's analysis echoes the thinking of Thomas Frank and his landmark 2004 book *What's the Matter with Kansas?,* which also focused on how the right bamboozles whites of modest means to get them to vote against their economic interests. Lopez, however, takes issue with Frank's de-emphasizing race as a factor in white support for conservative politics – Frank gave greater weight to social issues such as gay rights, religion and abortion. Lopez doesn't dismiss these, but argues that the primacy of race in American politics and society far outweigh the \"moral\" issues Frank cites. Especially given the rapid gains in LGBT rights since Frank's book appeared, Lopez has a point – race is the more persistent problem.\n\nWhile Lopez doesn't excuse Democrats who have used coded racial appeals – he indicts both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton on this score – he also shows how dog whistle politics is a central pillar of Republic strategy and is used as a cudgel against even moderate Democratic policies. Obama and other Democrats must fight back by directly addressing racial justice while articulating a positive vision of government, Lopez says.\n\nLopez's analysis is sound as far as it goes, but for socialists, he falters when he states that \"it is not great wealth itself, or corporations writ large, that are the problem.\" Rather, the culprits are \"self-interested billionaires and giant corporations that attempt to distort the democratic process to serve their own narrow interests.\" \"Distorting the democratic process\" is what corporations do on a daily basis. To follow Lopez's argument on a logical path that he himself does not take, one must conclude that race will continue to play a corrosive role in American politics until wealth is removed entirely from the democratic process. Liberal solutions will help, but radical ones will be needed to build a politics based on the fundamental interests of economics and class, rather than the socially concocted diversions of race and ethnicity.","order":1},{"title":"Analysis of Shallal Campaign Points Way to Progressive Electoral Politics in DC","date":"2014-06-01","issue":"June 2014","author":"Ingrid Goldstrom","body":"On April 28, a standing room only crowd of city-wide DC activists packed the Institute for Policy Studies to critically analyze progressive Andy Shallal's run for mayor of Washington DC. The highly energized group sought to create next steps for when, not if, Andy and other progressives seek elective offices. (You may remember that Andy was endorsed by the local DC Metro area DSA, which held a successful fundraiser on his behalf in March.). The meeting was chaired by E. Ethelbert Miller and presenters included Donna Brazile, Steve Cobble, Jonetta Rose Barras, and Joy Zarembka.\n\nOn the plus side, it was acknowledged that Andy brought an open discussion of race and inequality, gentrification, and education reform to the forefront of the campaign; in many instances, other candidates adopted his stance on issues and labeled themselves progressives.\n\nAndy's personal reflections included his thoughts about the wisdom of running within the Democratic Party. He felt that raising money for the campaign was the toughest hurdle to overcome and noted that progressives tend to give to causes and not political candidates.\n\nLessons learned were also addressed. A recurrent theme was that the city lacks an infrastructure to support progressive candidates, unlike those coalitions that successfully helped bring to power Chokwe Lumumba in Jackson, Mississippi, Bill deBlasio in New York City and Kshama Sawant in Seattle. There was even a mea culpa from one organization's head who admitted that while he and others supported Andy as individuals, he didn't press his organization to commit to Andy's campaign. (We need to ask ourselves if this was true of the DC local unions. DSA can feel good in this regard because it did literally put its money where its mouth is.)\n\nAnother theme was the need to bring the \"millennials\" into local politics. Many who came to DC were brought here by the Obama wave, yet few have transferred their interest in national policy to local issues. This largely transient population is less likely to even register to vote in DC.\n\nSo, where do we go from here? There is plenty to be done. A first step is for us to be at the table to develop a strategy to build the infrastructure of a (real) progressive coalition so that the bodies are in place for Andy's (or any other true progressive) next run. We need to make certain that any coalition is like the Rainbow Coalition, bringing together people of all ethnicities and social classes to recognize and fight for our common interests. For those of us more comfortable with taking concrete immediate actions, we can become involved in the movement to introduce rank order voting/run off voting to DC and/or join a movement to register and energize the youngest or newest city residents.\n\n[*Can the earth survive the Age of Man?*](http://dsadc.org/can-the-earth-survive-the-age-of-man/)\n\nSunday, June 1st, 2014\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;* June 2014**\n\n*By Bill Boteler*\n\nA review of *The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History* by Elizabeth Kolbert Henry Holt and Company, $28. 2014\n\nIn her new book, *The Sixth Extinction*, Elizabeth Kolbert sets out to explain why the planet seems to be in a spasm of mass extinctions of plants and animals and to introduce the relevant scientific concepts, illustrated by her globetrotting visits to locations where these are taking place.\n\nFor those new to the concept of mass extinctions, the book's title refers to the big five prehistoric mass extinction events as well as the current feared mass extinction. What these events all have in common includes a reversal of the ordinary rules of gradual change and adaption and a loss of a large percentage of species in a relatively short time. During such periods, the traits which allowed species to thrive are rendered useless by sudden environmental change.\n\nKolbert is an engaging science writer for *The New Yorker* and the short chapters are quick reading and should help introduce scientific concepts easily. She starts out with early naturalists trying to make sense of the fossilized remains of extinct animals within the context of the discovery of evolution. The uninitiated will discover how the idea of geological strata – a layer cake of rock going back in time – was discovered along with the existence of previous \"creations\".\n\nInitial theories of evolution favored the gradual change of living things adapting to their environment favoring survival of the fittest. The idea of catastrophic mass die-offs was resisted until evidence gradually began to mount and it is only in our lifetimes, for example, that the near-total annihilation of dinosaurs by a meteor strike was finally accepted with great resistance by the scientific community.\n\nWhat has emerged from these studies is a picture of extreme geological events taking place, making life on earth suddenly difficult for a large number of life forms – sometimes in a very short timespan. A lot of this is geological sleuthing. Whole groups of creatures suddenly vanish from the geological strata. What happened? Sometimes it was continents crashing together and altering global weather patterns, other times it may have been massive volcanic eruptions spewing gases into the atmosphere and killing off life in the oceans.\n\nOnce she introduces us to the idea of cataclysmic environmental change, Kolbert shows how it relates to our own epoch, which some geologists want to rename the Anthropocene (age of man). Humans are burning fossil fuel stored away in rocks over hundreds of billions of years and, in the process, changing the composition of the atmosphere back to what it was before prehistoric forests sucked the carbon out of the air. As we do this our climate returns to prehistoric conditions. Few currently living things are adapted to such a climate.\n\nBut as the book makes clear, there is more at work than climate change. Humans have unleashed a whole host of drastic changes that by themselves and, in interaction with each other, make it difficult for current plants and animals to adapt quickly enough to avoid going extinct.\n\nSome of these include: acidification of the oceans as CO^2^ mixes with seawater, conversion of large areas of the land surface to human uses, destruction of forests, and moving plants, animals and their diseases across oceans where they can wipe out the native species that encounter them.\n\nKolbert goes everywhere. She is hunting frogs with a flashlight in the jungle of Panama, diving on the Great Barrier Reef, observing experimental forest fragments in the Amazon, walking onbat carcasses in an abandoned mine in upstate New York or watching a rhino being inseminated at the Cincinnati Zoo. All the while she meets local scientists and conservationists at work. This makes for lively reading for people who may find a discussion of science to be off-putting.\n\nBut she lays out the relevant concepts clearly enough. We are an ingenious species that has managed to invade all corners of the planet in a period of just tens of thousands of years. On the way we gradually killed off most of the large animals that had not evolved to be wary of us. We created agriculture and modified a large part of the vegetation covering the earth's surface. We created the industrial revolution and began to alter the composition of the atmosphere and the acidity of the oceans. We moved organisms across oceans where they reduced the native species. In fact, we even killed off or out-competed our near relatives, the Neanderthals, but not before mating with them.\n\nShe suggests we are a restless, \"Faustian\" species out to change everything in our path without always realizing we are doing it. At the end of the book she tries to add an upbeat note that we are also very caring about other species and what we are doing and that we can still do things which may help the situation. I expect future books may have more upbeat stories about how people are trying to address the problem.\n\nAs for the human impact of these events, I was impressed by a couple of things. She discussed one experiment where scientists off the coast of Italy are studying sea life near ocean vents where natural CO^2^ is bubbling into the water. Where the level of acidity reaches what it may be in the world's oceans by 2100 AD, at that location she describes: \"...the underwater equivalent of a vacant lot\" (page 122). In other words, if we stay on our current path as far as climate change, we are looking at a wipeout of life in the ocean by the end of the century, or at least that is how I interpret it. The ocean is responsible for producing not just fish but a large part of the oxygen we breathe – about half. How will this much extinction affect our supply of oxygen?\n\nI was also struck by a description of what happened to the inhabitants of \"biosphere 2\", the experimental, closed ecosystem created decades ago in Arizona. Four bionauts entered that sealed environment for two years to live in a simulation of the planet's ecosystems. It had farmlands, a rainforest, and its own mini ocean with a coral reef. Toward the end of their stay, the inhabitants didn't have enough food or oxygen to breathe. Is this just a coincidence? What happened to biosphere 2 is not identical to what is happening to biosphere 1, but we are also experimenting with what happens when you put 7-9 billion human beings and their pollution-spewing industries into an enclosed bottle.\n\nAlso, members of DSA may be interested in the observation that one of the reasons for the success of our species, unlike other primates, is our capacity to cooperate. That, along with our ability to create and use symbols such as language rather than our use of tools, which are used by other species, is probably at the root of the Sixth Extinction.","order":2},{"title":"Fasanella captured the pain, joy of working-class America","date":"2014-06-03","issue":"June 2014","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"I met Ralph Fasanella in June 1988 at New York's Roseland Ballroom during a tribute to Michael Harrington, the founder and co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America. Harrington was suffering from a cancer that would claim his life a year later. But in the summer of 1988 he was attempting to fight the disease, and was still actively working to build DSA and the American left – possibly working harder than ever, knowing how little time he had left. Harrington's appreciative friends and supporters organized this tribute while Harrington was still with them, and hundreds of people turned out to hear a galaxy of stars of the left – including Barbara Ehrenreich, William Winpisinger, Edward Asner, Eleanor Holmes Norton – and others speak of what Harrington's life and work meant to them and to politics in the United States.\n\nFasanella was there as well, not as a speaker but at a table selling print versions of his paintings. I had admired Fasanella's work and went over to chat with him. About a minute into our conversation Fasanella, no doubt identifying me as someone with more free time than cash, said he had to step out for a few minutes, and would I watch his table for him? I readily agreed, and over the 15 minutes or so he was away I sold a couple of his prints. When he returned, he signed three prints and gave them to me as thank-you gifts. They now hang in my house as some of my most treasured possessions.\n\nBy then Fasanella had been \"discovered.\" A 1972 cover story in *New York* magazine came after three decades of churning out his large, detail-packed canvases of the joy and pain of American working-class life – especially through the lens of early 20<sup>th</sup>-century New York. His paintings were already known and appreciated in union halls and to connoisseurs of \"naïve\" art (a label Fasanella hated), but after the story and a full-scale one-man show he became something of a celebrity in the art world.\n\n\"Celebrity\" was a label the blunt, plain-spoken Fasanella would wear uneasily, for his painting was always rooted in the everyday life of the American worker, the men and women who toiled long hours in the factory, struggled to provide for their families, and – a critical part of his narrative – fought for their rights by organizing unions and taking to the streets. But I think Fasanella, who died in 1997, would be pleased at the exhibit of 27 of his works currently on display at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. \"[*Ralph Fasanella: Lest We Forget*](http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2014/fasanella/)\" arrives on the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the artist's birth and covers works from 1947, near the beginning of his artistic career, to the end of his life. The exhibit is only a slice of Fasanella's extensive body of work, but includes some of his best and most representative paintings.\n\nAccompanying the May 2 opening of the exhibit was a showing of the early 1990s documentary \"Fasanella\" at AFL-CIO headquarters, part of DC LaborFest. Appearing at the showing were Fasanella's son Marc and two grandchildren, as well as Glen Pearcy, the film's producer. A short clip from the film runs at the Smithsonian exhibit.\n\nFasanella never took an art lesson, and his paintings were dismissed by some critics for their lack of polish and their almost-but-not-quite realism. Perhaps most of all, Fasanella fell outside the conventions of late 20<sup>th</sup>-century art because his paintings were *about* something; they had a point of view and lacked the fashionable detachment of the high-art circles. Fasanella worked for years as a union organizer before taking up painting, and labor struggles and the effort to organize unions are the subjects of many of his paintings. The 1912 Lawrence, Mass. \"Bread and Roses\" textile workers' strike is featured in several of his paintings, including his monumental 1977 work \"Meeting at the Commons: Lawrence 1912\" with its dramatic scenario of a huge workers' demonstration under empty factory windows and troops marching to suppressing the uprising. A more somber work is \"Mill Worker: Night Shift\" with women visible in the factory windows, Hopperesque in their loneliness and isolation.\n\nFasanella drew from his own family life in his paintings, especially from his childhood in which his Italian immigrant parents struggled to support a growing family. His father Joe, an iceman, consumed by anger and bitterness over hard work that failed to lift him and his family out of poverty, abandoned the family when Ralph was a child. A series of surreal paintings from the 1950s depict Joe as a crucified Christ figure, with ice tongs serving as a crown of thorns. Fasanella's depictions of his family culminate in his 1972 \"Family Supper.\" An image of Fasanella's mother Ginevre dominates a scene reminiscent of Da Vinci's \"Last Supper,\" and the missing Joe is visible in his familiar crucifixion pose on a wall calendar. The motto \"Lest We Forget\" in inscribed in brickwork above the scene.\n\nFrom early in his development as a painter, many of Fasanella's works had an explicitly political edge. One of his earliest paintings, 1947's \"Pie in the Sky\" – the title drawn from the chorus of the old Joe Hill song \"The Preacher and the Slave\" – contrasts scenes of poverty and hardship with a gleaming stained-glass church that seeks to distract the masses with promises of heavenly riches. His political vision sharpened in the 1950s with complex, multilayered canvasses attacking McCarthyism and depicting Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, executed for alleged spying, as sacrifices to the era's hysteria. \"McCarthy Press\" centers around a pyramid of news headlines – not only political news but also sports and Hollywood gossip – as a crane lowers the Rosenbergs' coffin into the ground. \"The Rosenberg's Grey Day\" shows the couple stoically awaiting their fate, their children playing at their sides, while all around are images of incarcerated prisoners, a \"Save the Rosenbergs\" demonstration, a garden party, laborers hard at work in a factory. Even in the face of momentous events, life goes on, Fasanella tells us.\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing canvas in the exhibit is \"An American Tragedy,\" which tells numerous stories within its 40×90 inches. The central theme is the assassination of President Kennedy, who is depicted as yet another sacrifice to the greed and reactionary politics of the time. One has to look hard to spot Lee Harvey Oswald and his rifle, for in Fasanella's telling the assassin was only a tool of larger forces. The picture includes klansmen in full regalia, civil rights workers attacked by police, Martin Luther King Jr. leading a peaceful demonstration, Barry Goldwater heading a triumphal motorcade, and most prominently a man dressed in a mix of business and KKK attire, riding a black horse that tramples Kennedy's grave.\n\nFasanella's final painting, \"Farewell Comrade/End of the Cold War,\" was perhaps his most political statement, and the one in which he most clearly aired his socialist ideals. Here Lenin is being laid to rest in a crowded stadium, surrounded by the names of prominent American leftists and socialists (John Reed, Jack London), and news headlines such as \"Reagan Triples Deficit with Military.\" The message is clear: Communism's death took with it a share of the socialist ideals that it tried to embody, however imperfectly.\n\nYet Fasanella's paintings are not all workers' struggles and political anguish. Many of his works also depict the joy of community, of neighborhood, or workingmen and their families enjoying a respite from difficult lives. In particular, images of baseball run through his works, both organized games – as in \"Night Game: Practice Time\" — and the impromptu street games of children. But the sport can take on a darker cast, as mere games in the face of tragedy – as in 1979's \"Watergate,\" as a baseball game continues in the midst of images of American corruption and greed.\n\nIn the documentary, a student asks Fasanella which famous artist most inspired him. He cites Van Gogh, and his layering of paints and color patterns do bring that painter to mind. But perhaps the \"fine\" artist Fasanella more closely channeled was Marc Chagall, with whom he shared the allegorical themes, vivid colors and his deliberate use of figures that were out of scale to each other.\n\nBut in the end, Fasanella copied no one: not Van Gogh, nor Grandma Moses or Edward Hicks to whom he was often compared. He was *sui generis*, and when his paintings finally came to be appreciated, it was for their uniqueness, not their adherence to any school or formal style. Most of all, they are celebrated for forcefully conveying the ideals he lived and worked by, as summarized in his motto: \"Remember who you are. Remember where you came from. Don't forget the past. Change the world.\"\n\nThe Smithsonian exhibit runs through August 3. In addition to the exhibit, a good source on Fasanella's life and work is Patrick Wilson's 1973 book *Fasanella's City: The paintings of Ralph Fasanella with the story of his life and art (*Ballantine Books).","order":3},{"title":"Fighting Discrimination Using the Long View","date":"2014-06-01","issue":"June 2014","author":"Daniel Adkins","body":"Sometimes we meet biased people but do not always have a deep enough relationship to have a significant discussion – but we might try. Other times we interact with family, co-workers, or comrades and it would be foolish not to use our connections to question about certain beliefs. This is all good, but we still might remember that we all become dated\nby the times in which we grow up. This is apparent when we see old white\nmen using racist words. They got their world view in their youth and the reality of today's diversity must be an assault to their mind. A girlfriend who went to Howard University lent me some books to read back in the day. One was a biography of Colonel Robert Shaw, who was popularized in the film Glory. Colonel Shaw died fighting to save the Union and end slavery. I am not sure you can ask more of anyone. However, when he was on an expedition with his troops, he did act overly polite with the mistress of a slave plantation, which disgusted his troops. The troops then showed him the implements of discipline (torture) of the plantation. This section made me think that one can intellectually be opposed to something (be an abolitionist), but still not know its full shocking reality. That we can never really walk in someone else's shoes does not mean we cannot show service and solidarity.\n\nA quirk in how some Americans view the world is that some of us see that all important things happened after they were born and the other stuff is just history and not important. This might be called the \"point\" view of history or the just \"today\" approach as opposed to a \"vector\" approach which might see us moving through time and into a future. The point view, meaning mainly viewing your present, is popular for many, especially those who only judge groups on their current achievements. The \"point\" approach probably is wired into us going back to all our ancestors, because not paying attention to our immediate situational awareness would have led us to be someone else's lunch. The \"vector\" approach or \"viewing the movement of history\" would see the need for a larger knowledge base to include history and the sciences. The vector approach implies a situational awareness not of today or just the few decades we as individuals have been on Earth, but of the cosmos, human history, and at least a good guess of our future. Admittedly we cannot know all, but trying to have a grasp of the movement of history and change is necessary in today's society in order to understand societal and climate change.\n\nIf we use the longer-view approach, critiquing biases can be based on viewing human reality and history on a more factual basis. For those of us in the West, it should be humbling that China and India have had the highest percent of the world's GDPs and level of science for the longest time of the last two millennia, and that time is returning. Now, in 2014, China has the largest GDP of any country and is reclaiming its old position. A fuller knowledge of history aids our humility and should deflate our ethnic grandiosity.\n\nSome men disparage women's abilities. This may harken back to the days when physical force was a factor in production or war. However, it is long past the day that physical force has not been replaced by mechanical or computer operations. Also the process of sexual selection does not reflect highly on either sex when men walk into lampposts or women act dumb. Although women are not prominent in the physical sciences, times are changing and as the program COSMOS (see article) shows, women have made great contributions. In the last hundred years women have gone from a few college graduates to the majority. If a guy is not impressed by women's achievements, he should look at the trend of society and it should be humbling. Also there are recent studies that show that the more women in bank leadership in the U.K., the less financial losses the banks had in the last recession. It is true that men take more chances but that is not always wise.\n\nHistorical claims of racial superiority do not pass today's laugh test, such as claiming slaves were inferior but not allowing them to learn to read or write or be educated. It is true that we can see color easier than understanding that color is controlled by only 10 of 30-40,000 genes. That a Euro-American mother sent her child (Barack Obama) to an elite high school, aided him, and he became president suggest that with the proper education and help the U. S. could have many more highly qualified people and less poverty. That some of us get every educational advantage while other of us struggle getting a job or paying of debt does not mean the accomplished are there just because of their IQs. It does mean that society is not living up to its potential and that may bite us as the world develops and international competition grows.","order":4},{"title":"Good reads for JUNE – the Washington Socialist","date":"2014-06-03","issue":"June 2014","author":"","body":"Can't get enough Piketty?

But in the Summer 2014 edition of the group's journal *International Socialist Review (ISR),* associate editor Joel Geier appears to argue that democratic debate is in fact crucial to socialism.\n\nIn a long article on Grigory Zinoviev, a protégé of Lenin's who in 1920s helped to forge the Communist Third International into a unified and disciplined movement dedicated to the defending the Soviet Union at all costs, Geier contends that Zinoviev – with Stalin behind him – helped to kill the revolutionary character of Communism in the 1920s by banning all organized political factions within it. \"Before 1924, factions existed within all Communist parties,\" Geier writes, adding: \"The right to form factions was and is a basic democratic right in any socialist organization. Without it, the membership is denied the right to think, to dissent, and to come up with alternative policies ... (I)t cannot bring the living experience of the rank and file with their connection to the non-party working class and social movements into creating, developing, extending, and correcting party policy.\"\n\nAs Geier expresses it, \"If workers cannot control their own party, they cannot become fit to rule, to run society ... (and) without workers' democracy there is no revolutionary workers' party, no matter what it calls itself.\" Geier admits that Trotsky himself forgot this point in the early 1920s when he \"championed the banning of factions and a one-party state.\" Yet without demonizing Trotsky or other Bolsheviks for this mistake, Geier argues, \"neither should we uncritically accept, because of their authority, the views of our ancestors.\"\n\nJust what the article signifies in terms of actual ISO policies is hard to judge.

A coalition of various peace advocacy and social justice organizations, MUPJ's conference provides workshops and forums that allow activists to sharpen their skills, bring on-going issues into focus, and lay the basis for further initiatives to change our world for the better.\n\nThat commitment was well-expressed by Paul Chappell, a West Point graduate and Iraq War veteran who spoke of his personal transformation from someone who didn't question our military policies and overseas war, from someone who listened to and accepted Rush Limbaugh's view of the world, into a peace activist who questions what he is told, questions the morality and practicality of US overseas policies — and thus today is engaged in building a movement to \"wage peace\" not war. Kristi Casteel gave a moving tribute to her son, Joshua, another war veteran turned peace activist who died from a cancer likely caused by his exposure to uranium deposits and burn pits used by the US military in Iraq. In a video recording of one of his speeches, Joshua, who served as an interrogator at Abu Ghraib, states that there is no such thing as a private conscience; conscience must be public to be real. He made that point in reference to himself, noting that he initially believed that being a humane interrogator would be better for prisoners than facing a person filled with hate – but he ultimately concluded that this was an impossible contradiction, that an oppressive system can't be made better by the good intentions of a few people working within it. Rather, he came to believe that our wars, all war, had to be opposed and ended root and branch. Thus he joined Iraq Veterans Against the War, addressed audiences across the world, and wrote plays speaking to what he saw and learned, including *Returns* and *The Interrogation Room*.\n\nSocial activism for peace necessarily becomes activism for open democratic governance, as those who profit from militarism inevitably try to shield their actions from the public. That connection was made by J. Kirk Wiebe, who lost his job and suffered from government harassment because of his NSA (National Security Agency) whistle-blowing, and Kathleen McClellan, the National Security and Human Rights Counsel of the Government Accountability Project. Their discussion of government attempts to prevent truth-telling speaks to the broad threat to democratic civil liberties as witnessed by the prosecution of Chelsea Manning and the attempts to extradite Julian Assange and Edward Snowden.\n\nMUPJ's conference, however, was not about sitting and listening. Most of the time was taken by numerous small, participatory workshops that focused on issues ranging from building a movement to end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank to the building of peace initiatives amongst divided populations in Northern Ireland and Cyprus. Closer to home, a workshop discussed the campaign to build support in Maryland for an initiative to amend the Constitution and end the disgrace of the Supreme Court's *Citizens United* and *McCutcheon* decisions allowing unlimited private campaign spending that is turning \"public elections into private auctions.\" Other workshops addressed various aspects of our criminal-justice system which is itself a model of injustice, robbing countless youth – especially African Americans and Latinos — of their future, providing them little or no meaningful education while they are locked up, little help when they re-enter society. One session focused on the particularly cruel injustice of a Maryland law that automatically sends juveniles accused of felonies to adult jails.\n\nDeveloping skills to build trust between generations and skills to build a movement for peace that is as humane and open in its organizing as the vision which animates activism was another workshop theme, as were workshops to help older participants navigate retirement and aging while staying engaged and connected to youth. If there was a weakness in the gathering, it was that the average age of attendees was too high. Hope, however, was present with the acknowledgment of high school students who participate in anti-violence and pro-peace activities. Coming from the \"Gandhi Brigade\" at Montgomery-Blair High School in Silver Spring, from Bladensburg High School in Prince George's County, and the Key School in Annapolis, these young people provided inspiration as examples that future generations are taking up the challenge to create a better world.\n\nGiving recognition to teens engaged in peace work is part of a process that aims to help them find the path toward a lifetime commitment to peace and justice. That will only be possible if conference participants and other activists across the state find the means to build long-lasting bridges connecting peace activism to a vision of sustainable development that is inclusionary, participatory and environmentally sound. So there is a need to strengthen on all sides the connection of campaigns to end militarism with social justice campaigns such as those to raise the minimum wage, strengthen labor rights and legalize the status of immigrants. The concrete tasks that lay ahead were laid out in State Senator Jamie Raskin's address to the conference in which he spoke of a Maryland progressive agenda that is building support for the twin goals of peace and justice.","order":7},{"title":"Rain, Rain, Rain, Rain .... Is This What Climate Change Looks Like In the Greater Metro Washington Region?","date":"2014-06-01","issue":"June 2014","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"Heavier rains and more destructive floods are two kinds of weather events that atmospheric researchers commonly expect to result from continued greenhouse warming. According to the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists now have \"medium confidence\" that higher average global temperatures already have begun to generate more intense precipitation events like these across North America. A National Climate Assessment (NCA) report released by the Obama administration on May 6 further concludes that in the northeastern United States in particular, the frequency of extreme rainstorms and snowstorms has risen by more than 70 percent since the late 1950s; the NCA adds that further increases can be expected so long as climate change continues.\n\nIs it possible if not rather likely, therefore, that the heavy and sometimes destructive rains that the Metro Washington DC region has seen since late April may have be largely due to climate change, aka \"global warming\"?\n\nAnd pragmatically speaking, should local residents conclude that increasingly severe rainstorms may be becoming the \"new normal\" for our area, one that local governments should address through more proactive land-use policies and stepped-up investments in water-related infrastructure?\n\nClimate experts nearly always refrain from attributing specific weather events to long-term trends in climate, and no one seems to be publicly linking the earth's warming average temperatures to the remarkable wet spring our region has recently experienced. But whatever the cause (or causes), the Metro DC area and adjacent parts of Virginia and Maryland have been hit with extremely intense rains over the past few weeks. These singular events, dominating the news short-term, add up to a more ominous trend. Total precipitation for this year, so far, is more than 30 percent above normal.\n\nThe most dramatic downpour came on April 30, when the Metro region was visited by a massive but slow-moving storm system that had previously generated a spate of deadly tornadoes in the Midwest and South before deluging Pensacola, Florida with more than 20 inches of rain over a two-day period. When the storm struck the Metro D.C. area, it set new precipitation records in the rain gauges at Reagan, Dulles and Thurgood Marshall airports, and in some parts of the region it delivered more rain in a few days than normally falls in a month.\n\nIn Georgetown near the D.C. entrance to the C&O Canal, the heavy rains triggered the rupture of a major sewer interceptor, releasing some five million gallons of mixed storm water and untreated sewage onto the popular Capital Crescent Trail. From there the sewage flowed into the Potomac. The rains that began April 30 also triggered sewage overflows elsewhere; *The Dupont Current* newspaper quoted John Lisle of the D.C. Water agency to the effect that about \"215 million gallons of combined sewage\" overall flowed into the Potomac, Rock Creek and the Anacostia River during the storm.\n\nParts of Maryland received up to seven inches of rain in 24 hours from the downpour. In Fort Washington in Prince George's County, heavy rains that began April 30 were followed by the partial collapse of a 1,500-foot stretch of wooded hillside in the upscale Piscataway Hills neighborhood from May 2 through May 5. The topsoil along a hillside fronting on Piscataway Drive slipped about three feet downwards, damaging six houses and toppling several 200-foot trees, which carried power lines with them. The land slippage also caused breaks in local water and sewer lines which contributed to a big crack opening up in Piscataway Drive. Alarmed for the safety of local residents, Fort Washington officials ordered the evacuation of more than two dozen houses in the neighborhood.\n\nIn Baltimore during the same storm, rain flooded part of the Inner Harbor area, more than 1.6 million gallons of combined sewage and storm water were released into local waterways in the wider Baltimore County area, and a one-block stretch of 26th Street in the Charles City area collapsed along with a sidewalk and an adjacent retaining wall and fell onto the nearby tracks of the CSX Railroad.\n\nLesser damage occurred in Cockeysville and Bowie, and there were flooded roads in Charles and Harford counties. In Laurel, the discovery of leaks in the nearby Duckett Dam led local officials to open the dam's gates, forcing the evacuation of a nearby senior apartment complex and leading to the flooding of a car dealership and commuter parking lot.\n\nThen the rains abated and the region began to dry out, but a second major downpour occurred over the weekend of May 16. During this storm, there was flooding in downtown Annapolis and along the Alexandria waterfront, a motorist trapped on an inundated road in Loudon County had to climb on top of her car and wait for emergency responders to rescue her, and there were 10 drivers who needed rescuing in Fairfax County, where officials closed 45 roads for fear of flooding. Damage to local businesses and homeowners from the two rainstorms have been heavy in dollar terms.\n\nIntense rains were not the only factor contributing to the Metro region's recent weather woes, it should be noted. As the *Post* and other media have reported, the wooded Piscataway Hills neighborhood that suffered from the slope collapse in early May is sited on a layer of Marlboro clay, which is notoriously slippery when wet; residents also have experienced lesser land slips, the dangers of falling trees and small breaks in local water and sewer lines before. Arguably, it's questionable whether local land use regulations should have permitted upscale residential construction along the slope in the first place.\n\nLong before the rupture of the Georgetown interceptor sewer on April 30, similarly, the District of Columbia experienced a long line repeated of sewage overflows into local waterways from its antiquated system of combined storm and sanitary sewers. To cure the problem, the city recently launched a DC Clean Rivers Project which is supposed to capture excessive rain flows, partly through the construction of a giant underground tunnel to hold some of the flows and partly through other means. But funding for full implementation of the project has been lacking, and it is not scheduled for completion for years to come. In the meantime, as an environmental attorney with Earthjustice, Jennifer Chavez, told *The Dupont Current* in May, the D.C. Water agency and the city government have not kept up with the infrastructure spending the sewer system needs, \"and that's just showing up in so many ways ... This is just one of the latest examples.\"\n\nYet our region's heavy rains did aggravate whatever flaws already existed in Fort Washington's zoning regulations and the D.C. Government's storm water management, and the physics of climate change indicates the situation will worsen before it improves. Warm water evaporates more readily than cool water; warmer air can hold more moisture before becoming saturated than cooler air. Thus as global average temperatures rise along with the atmosphere's concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, causing rising ocean temperatures and a warmer atmosphere above the oceans, it follows that the atmosphere should carry more moisture.\n\nIn some arid areas distant from the oceans, the air's greater capacity to absorb water should aggravate desert-like conditions by sucking additional moisture from places where it is already scarce. In much of the American Southwest, for example, continued greenhouse warming is predicted to create extensive droughts. But given the Metro DC region's location in relation to Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, more water vapor in the air here should mean greater downpours of rain and heavier snowfalls when the triggering conditions are right.\n\nAt present, moreover, there is virtually no chance that the U.S. Government and other governments around the world will act to slow CO2 emissions and global climate change very soon. The fossil fuel industry's remarkable successes at extracting huge volumes of oil and natural gas from deep shale formations in recent years, and the rising levels of U.S. fossil fuel production this permits, now offer the best chance of a rapid revival of the economy, according to a recent cover story in Politico magazine.\n\nThe May/June 2014 issue of *Foreign Affairs*, similarly, with the cover title \"Big Fracking Deal: Shale and the Future of Energy,\" hails the recent revolution in U.S. oil and gas production from shale as one \"that will drive a fundamental change in global energy markets.\" In devoting a special section of their magazine to this industry, the editors of *Foreign Affairs* caution, \"our aim has not been to pick winners or losers; the market is making those decisions already, in real time.\"\n\nBut the magazine leads off its coverage of the shale energy boom not with any mention of the carbon dioxide emissions and added climate change it will inevitably cause, but with a guest article by Edward L. Morse, of Citi's global investment group, which envisions the U.S. soon becoming the worlds' largest oil producer, as well as the world's largest exporter of natural gas. This development \"on balance,\" Morse argues, will be \"a good thing for the world.\"\n\nA second article in the May/June edition of *Foreign Affairs*, by energy industry entrepreneur Robert A. Hefner III, states that while \"the shale revolution has its naysayers,\" the nation's political leaders \"need to recognize that today America has an unprecedented opportunity for long-term economic growth that can generate good middle-class jobs, help it leave the Great Recession behind for good, and grant it geopolitical advantages over its competitors for decades to come.\"\n\nThe Obama administration, through recent campaign-related statements on global climate change, in some ways appears to be countering this kind of optimistic energy rhetoric. Obama's release of the May 6 National Climate Assessment has triggered *Wall Street Journal* editorials attacking him on this issue. But as the *Washington Post*'s Dana Milbank noted on May 7, the White House on May 5, just before releasing the NCA, held a press briefing by counselor John Podesta, who celebrated the fact that thanks in part to the President's \"all of the above\" energy policies, the United States is now \"the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.\" When questioned about whether this development might aggravate global climate change, Milbank reports, Podesta replied that the Obama White House is now \"firing on all cylinders when it comes to producing more energy, cleaner energy and more energy efficiency, as well as combating climate change.\"\n\nChampions of greater American exports of oil and natural gas also have recently argued that booming U.S. energy exports, at least over time, should give the U.S. an ability to block Vladimir Putin's foreign ambitions by undercutting Russia's leading industry, the energy industry, through increased U.S. exports of liquified natural gas – thus freeing Western Europe and the Ukraine from dependence on Russian gas exports.\n\nWith U.S. politics and economics being what they are, a calculated ignorance about the likely results of enhanced fossil fuel production is likely to persist within the U.S. government for the foreseeable future. The same point applies to many other national governments – such as Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria and Iran, for example – with their own interests in fossil fuel production. For now, then, continuing high levels of greenhouse gas emissions and a continued warming of the global climate all seem inevitable. As the expected warming occurs, the Metro D.C. area will no doubt experience many more \"extreme\" rainfall events. Isn't it time for municipal and state governments in this region to start preparing for them?","order":8},{"title":"Tyson brings the universe up to date","date":"2014-06-03","issue":"June 2014","author":"Daniel Adkins","body":"Three new series have arrived that are important and useful popular history.

An Historical Overview","date":"2014-06-01","issue":"June 2014","author":"Andy Feeney ","body":"*(EDITOR'S NOTE: This history and analysis was presented at the Socialist Salon in April as part of a discussion anatomizing the sometimes-fractured socialist Left in the US. We are publishing the documents from that very fertile session for newer members and old to contextualize as much as possible today's varieties of resistance to US capitalism. See, for instance, \"A Guide to the US Socialist Left\"* [**in the May issue**](http://dsadc.org/welcome-to-the-may-day-edition-of-the-washington-socialist/)*. This document does not necessarily represent the official position of DSA or the Metro DC DSA chapter).*\n\nSocialists are historically divided into the democratic/electoral traditions (including democratic socialists) and Leninists (including Communists). There are logical reasons for this division, which along with other factors (e.g. egotism of individual socialists, police infiltration of leftist groups etc.) often causes conflicts within the US left. However, it takes an excursion into history to better understand why the division exists.\n\n**The Non-Anarchist Socialist Movement Before 1895, Both Marxist and Non-Marxist.** Before around 1896, all Marxist socialist parties were in agreement that capitalism is an inherently destructive system that is doomed in the long run due to the operation of certain economic and social laws. In this view, the future must consist either of \"socialism, or barbarism,\" and revolutionary socialists need to work for the first alternative.\n\nThere were other socialist tendencies in the 1880s, however, notably the Fabian socialists of England, that rejected Marxist theory on this score. The Fabians argued for a gradual, largely peaceful approach to transforming capitalism through political and economic reforms along with education.\n\n**Socialists vs. Anarchists on the Role of the State.** Both Marxist socialists and Fabian socialists differed from the anarchists of the late 19th century regarding the possibilities of working for change through the political state. Anarchists, especially those following Mikhail Bakunin, held that the state was inherently oppressive, just as much as capitalism itself, and that the revolutionary working class needs to avoid entanglement with the state and ultimately abolish it through revolution. Bakunin also pointed to authoritarian tendencies within Marx's personality as an added reason to distrust mainstream socialism.\n\nThe Fabians, along with certain \"Cathedral socialists\" in Germany, held hopes that the state might be used to reform or tame capitalism. Marx came to agree with the anarchists that ultimately, the state was an instrument of class oppression that must \"wither away\" or even be \"smashed\" by the workers; however, in the meantime he applauded trade unions working through the state for economic reforms. Following the rise of the Paris Commune in 1871 and its destruction, Marx further concluded along with Blanqui, an earlier French communist, that the workers would need to establish a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" following the revolution, if only to protect its victories from violent capitalist counter-revolution.\n\nIn actual practice, many Marxist socialist or \"social democratic\" parties in the 1890s practiced a reformist politics, arguing for the long-term bankruptcy of capitalism and its revolutionary overthrow when the time became ripe, but in the meanwhile pursuing practical reforms to benefit their working class supporters. In the short run, such Social Democratic parties fought for such things as universal suffrage, improved workplace conditions, shorter work weeks, and the creation of social welfare programs and old-age pensions.\n\n**Eduard Bernstein and the Socialist Fight Over \"Revisionism**.\" Between 1896 and 1900, Eduard Bernstein, a leading member of the world's then-leading socialist party, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), broke with Marxist orthodoxy regarding reforms vs. revolution. Bernstein's ideas helped trigger some divisions still evident in the socialist movement today.\n\nCapitalism was not developing as Marx had originally predicted, Bernstein wrote: it was not impoverishing the mass of workers as Marx had said it would, and it was not simplifying class conflicts by forcing the vast majority of the population into the industrial proletariat – the inevitable \"gravediggers of capitalism,\" in Marx's words. Instead, capitalism in the 1890s was creating new complexities in class relations, and allowing German workers to improve their conditions significantly without revolution. Bernstein, who had met with Fabian socialists during a stay in England, therefore rejected the traditional Marxist idea of working-class revolution and called for an \"evolutionary socialism\" in its place.\n\nWhatever the long-term goal of socialist politics might be was irrelevant to him; Bernstein declared; what he cared about was the process of getting there. Bernstein also suggested that moral idealism, not the supposedly iron laws of economics formulated by Marx, should provide a framework for socialist politics.\n\nBernstein's \"revisionism\" shocked most leaders of the German SPD, although it probably did not come as a shock to many pragmatic trade union leaders belonging to the party. It soon triggered an important response from V.I. Lenin, a rising star in the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (SDLP).\n\n**Lenin vs. Bernstein's Revisionism**: **Toward a \"Vanguardist\" Marxist Politics**. Partly to safeguard Marxism against the lure of \"revisionism,\" Lenin in a 1902 pamphlet called *What Is To Be Done* laid out a new model for socialist work in the Russian empire.\n\nRevolutionary Marxists needed to guard against mere \"economism,\" the mere organizing of the workers for short-term economic advantage, Lenin argued. The Russian party instead needed to respond to, and seek to inspire, a \"vanguard\" of more politically conscious workers who might win their less educated and more complacent fellow-workers away from the hypnotic allure of ruling–class ideas, or \"hegemony.\"\n\nTo this end, the Russian SDLP needed to recruit, not a mass following of individuals with varying levels of commitment and understanding, but a small core of hard-core professional revolutionaries, a vanguardist \"cadre\" that could transmit revolutionary ideas to the mass of Russian workers and prepare them for the overthrow of Czarism.\n\n**Critiques of Lenin's Vanguardism from Other Socialists**. Lenin's ideas were controversial even with some Russian socialists and with revolution-minded Marxists elsewhere. The revolutionary German socialist Rosa Luxemburg, for example, privately expressed fears that Lenin's model of political organization would lead to authoritarian dictatorship over the working class, not its emancipation; a youthful Leon Trotsky predicted it could lead to \"dictatorship over the proletariat.\"\n\nYet despite such disagreements, Lenin's party continued to belong to the Second International of Social Democratic parties established in 1889, and he considered himself an ally of Karl Kautsky, the leader of the German SPD. Between roughly 1889 and 1914, the different parties of the Second International agreed to work for peace among their various home countries and to resist any call by their national leaders to engage in an \"imperialist\" war against one another.\n\n**1914: The Second International Fails to Halt the Rush to War**. In 1914, however, many European socialist parties voted to support their own governments as these governments entered World War I. Eugene Debs and the members of the Socialist Party in the US as well as many anarcho-syndicalist members of the American IWW held out for peace, at great cost to themselves; the Russian SDLP also rejected the war, and socialist parties in Scandinavia and Italy did as well. But the great socialist parties of France and Germany and the mass of British workers eagerly supported the war; in Germany, Kautsky along with Luxemburg and a few others refused to approve of the government's call for a war budget, but the rest of the German party capitulated to war fever.\n\n**The Bolshevik Revolution and the Start of the Third International.** When the Russian Revolution of 1917 enabled Lenin and his Bolsheviks to take control of the Russian state, they scorned the Social Democratic parties of the Second International as sell-outs and compromisers with the capitalist war machine. In 1919 Lenin launched a Third International to replace the Second, urging socialist sympathizers with the Bolshevik Revolution everywhere to form national \"Communist\" parties and to submit to an iron discipline under the direction of revolutionary Moscow, which alone had succeeded in carrying out the original socialist goal of overthrowing capitalism and inaugurating a new kind of society.\n\nThe brutal Russian civil war that followed the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917 (or November 1917, depending on which calendar is used to mark the event) soon involved Lenin and his comrades in actions that deepened their differences with many social democrats in the West. So did extensive military interventions by many western capitalist governments – including, to a limited extent, that of the United States – on the side of the counter-revolutionary Whites in the civil war.\n\n**The Third International and the Theory of Capitalist Encirclement.** A pattern thus developed under Lenin, and was later greatly magnified under Stalin, of the new Soviet Union feeling encircled and menaced by a hostile capitalist world. Soviet leaders, citing the threat to their very existence posed by counter-revolutionaries at home and military attack from abroad, came to argue that it was justifiable and even urgently necessary for the world's leading revolutionary state to defend itself against attack by taking certain steps – even dictatorial and \"terroristic\" ones – that idealistic, less embattled social democrats in the West might feel were authoritarian and immoral. The Soviet leaders argued that not just the new Soviet Union's existence, but the hopes for socialist revolution worldwide, rested on the USSR being able to defend its form of socialism from overthrow or attack. And for decades, the non-Russian Communist parties of the Third International agreed.\n\nMany divisions now visible on the U.S. left can be traced to these historic events.\n\nThe American Socialist Party soon split over whether to support the Bolsheviks, with Eugene Debs and some other socialists rejecting Bolshevism as an undemocratic travesty of Marxism, while other Socialist Party members united with some former members of the anarcho-syndicalist IWW to form a new Communist Party. In fact, American socialists formed two new Communist Parties by the early 1920s, with John Reed attempting to launch a more \"American\" party that he hoped would rely less on the leadership of recent immigrants and might be more appealing to native-born WASP workers.\n\n**Conflicts Between Social Democratic Parties and Communists Prior to the Rise of Hitler.** Relationships between the old Socialist Party and the new Communist Party were bitter throughout the 1920s and into the 1930s. However, in the late 1930s the American Communist Party, mostly in response to Soviet foreign policy concerns, embarked on a \"popular front\" period in which its members tried to unite with socialists and even American liberals and other non-socialists for the purposes of defeating fascism.\n\n**The Communist Party Cooperates with Liberals in the Popular Front Period**. During the Popular Front period, when Stalin's foreign policy called for Communists everywhere to unite with other forces to defeat the threat of Nazi aggression, American Communists worked with other radicals and even with liberal Democrats on common goals, and the party's popularity grew as a result. The 1939-1941 Hitler-Stalin Pact greatly disrupted the work of the Popular Front, in part because Communists now had to repudiate anti-Fascist politics they had preached just a year before. However, with Hitler's 1941 invasion of the USSR and the heroic Russian stand against Nazi armies in the Battle of Stalingrad and elsewhere, Communist Party members briefly became \"good Americans,\" with many serving in the armed services, the federal bureaucracy, and even the OSS – the precursor of the CIA.\n\n**The Communist Party's General Cooperation with the Democratic Party Today**. The American Communist Party today arguably bears some signs of the Popular Front period still. During this period, individual Communists did important work in organizing the CIO federation of industrial labor unions; they also fought for civil rights for African Americans and rallied Americans to support the fight against Hitler. Some Communists made theoretical contributions to feminism as well.\n\nAfter World War II ended, Communist popularity soon ended, as the Cold War began and Harry Truman launched a \"loyalty oath\" campaign against Communists in the government. Truman's anti-Communist push was soon followed by the McCarthy era. But while the Popular Front was at its peak from 1935-1945, the Communist Party's membership grew and it benefited from its endorsement of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. Today, it is arguable that a much-reduced CPUSA is still practicing Popular Front, Democratic Party-centered politics, much to the displeasure of Trotskyist and Maoist parties to its left.\n\nWhile the American CP during the Cold War often supported the Democratic Party on domestic issues, however, it did not always do so on foreign policy. At least before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, the American CP customarily followed the general line that Lenin laid out for the Comintern in 1919 – of resolutely defending the Soviet Union against all external political, intellectual and military attacks. In the 1950s and 1960s, especially, this often led American Communists to split with liberal Democrats on key foreign policy questions.\n\n**Trotskyism's Origins as a Dissident \"Revolutionary\" Movement Among Communists.** The Trotskyist movement, both in the US and elsewhere, initially began as a reaction against Stalin's growing power and growing authoritarianism in the late 1920s.\n\n**Trotsky on Stalinist Autocracy**. Trotsky, who had joined Lenin in leading the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917 and who organized and led the Red Army in the fierce civil war afterwards, was in some ways partly responsible the authoritarian rules that helped Stalin to gain dictatorial control of the Soviet state in the 1920s. At one point in his career, in fact, Trotsky was seen by some Russian Communists as a potentially more authoritarian leader than Stalin. However, as Stalin's best-known political opponent after 1930, Trotsky came to stand in the eyes of many of his followers for a more responsive, less bureaucratic, and arguably more \"democratic\" approach to Communist revolution.\n\n**Trotsky and the Theory of \"Permanent Revolution\"** **and World Revolution.** Trotsky, who had helped to formulate a theory of \"permanent revolution\" to justify the Bolsheviks taking power in Russia, a backward and impoverished society by European standards, also differed strongly with Stalin over the question of whether Russian socialism could be self-sufficient. Classical Marxist doctrine said it would be impossible to build \"socialism in one country,\" and the Marxist theory of history proceeding by stages further held that in general, societies must first experience capitalism before they can gain the economic productivity and general prosperity necessary to make a decent form of \"socialism\" possible.\n\nFrom an orthodox Marxist perspective, then, \"socialist\" revolution in Russia was arguably impossible in 1917. But several years earlier, Trotsky had argued that Russian capitalism was the weak link in the chain of global capitalism, and that socialist revolution was likely to break out precisely where the chain was at its weakest, not in the well-established Western capitalist societies where Marx had originally expected revolution to begin. Thus in Trotsky's eyes, Russia as a weak link in the capitalist chain had a role to play in triggering a larger world revolution.\n\nRussian socialism might survive and create a good society despite the problem of Russian backwardness, Trotsky further argued, if the Bolshevik revolution ignited sympathetic revolutions in more advanced European countries. If socialist revolution triumphed in Europe, then an advanced socialist Europe could come to the rescue of backward Russia, saving it from the disaster that might otherwise occur from Marxists trying to \"skip\" over needed stages of development.\n\nThe problem for Trotsky was that leading capitalist states in Europe experienced no successful socialist revolutions in the 1920s, leaving the new Union of Soviet Socialist Republics stranded.\n\nStalin came to argue that, Marxist dogma notwithstanding, \"socialism in one country\" – at least temporarily – was both necessary and possible. Trotsky responded that the Bolshevik Revolution needed to expand to new societies to survive, and that Stalin was betraying the Revolution by not doing enough to make this possible.\n\n**Some Effects of Trotsky's Thinking on American Trotskyism Today.** In the United States, both the Trotskyist criticism of Stalinism as \"undemocratic\" and of the Soviet Union as a \"deformed workers' state\" AND the Trotskyist insistence on world revolution have played important roles in Trotskyist politics.\n\nFor example, criticism of Stalinist dictatorship, and perhaps other personal factors, led a number of leading Trotskyist intellectuals of the 1920s and 1930s to become anti-Communist cold warriors by the 1950s and 1960s. In fact, some prominent Trotskyists eventually became neo-conservatives.\n\nOther Trotskyist radicals over the years have created small breakaway sects that have remained committed to revolution and even a Leninist \"dictatorship of the proletariat, \" yet they still harshly criticize most existing Communist governments – e.g. in China, and to an extent Cuba – as undemocratic and \"bureaucratic\" and thus a betrayal of \"real\" Leninism. Such Trotskyist parties may disagree over whether existing \"socialist\" governments are \"bureaucratically deformed workers' states\" or \"state capitalist,\" but they generally agree that such governments oppress the working class.\n\nHowever, a concern for world revolution and a fierce opposition to capitalist imperialism – according to Lenin, \"the Highest Stage of Capitalism\" – have led other Trotskyist groups to support Communist governments in Cuba and even North Korea, as well as the Islamic government of Iran, as fighters against western imperialism. This is at least partly in line with Trotsky's ideas about imperialism and the imperatives of permanent revolution.\n\n**Maoism as a Reaction Against Both Capitalism and the Old Soviet Union's Acceptance of \"Peaceful Coexistence.\"** American Maoism is of more recent vintage than either the American Communist Party or the various Trotskyist groups. Like Trotskyism, Maoism in many ways reflects disillusionment with the Soviet Union as the leader of global revolution, and with the American CP as a \"revisionist\" and hence non-revolutionary form of Marxism.\n\nIn leading the Chinese Communist Party in the 1920s and 1930s, Mao Zedong broke with Marxist orthodoxy in several striking ways. He based his revolutionary movement on rebellious peasants in the countryside, not (for the most part) industrial workers in the cities. He also insisted that the \"Chinese road\" to revolution would not necessarily mimic the Russian road. His Chinese Red Army came to power not through a Bolshevik-style coup in the capital, but through prolonged guerrilla warfare in the countryside. And in the 1950s, Mao broke with Nikita Khrushchev's USSR partly over the question of \"peaceful coexistence\" with the capitalist West. While Khrushchev pointed to the risk of US-USSR conflicts triggering nuclear war, Mao responded that American imperialism was a \"paper tiger\" and that even nuclear weapons could not ultimately defeat a revolutionary people. This and certain differences in national interests led Maoist China by the late 1950s to break politically with the USSR, and soon inspired splits between revolutionary-minded Maoists in the West and more orthodox Communists.\n\n**American Maoism and the New Left of the 1960s.** American Maoist groups in many cases grew out of the New Left of the 1960s, as radical students came to reject American capitalism and an American \"imperialism\" that seemed all too evident in the war in Vietnam, where a peasant guerrilla army partly inspired by Maoist ideas was courageously defeating the huge and well-equipped U.S. military machine.\n\n**The RCP's Maoism and Support for the Goals of the Cultural Revolution**. Another aspect of Mao's China that appealed to some American Maoists, including Bob Avakian of the Revolutionary Communist Party, was its bloody although ultimately unsuccessful fight against bureaucracy and elitism within the Chinese Communist Party itself.\n\nBy the 1960s, it was clear to many critics of Marxism that in societies led by Communist parties, top-ranking Party members and members of the government bureaucracy tended to morph into a new governing class – putting the lie to socialist claims to forge a classless society. Mao is believed by many critics to have had some unsavory motives in launching his \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\" in the 1960s, and the Cultural Revolution arguably ended in disaster. But Mao's stated aim in launching it was to enlist peasants, ordinary workers and students in a fight against elitism and a \"capitalist road\" mentality within the Communist Party itself.\n\nIn the view of the RCP's Avakian, who wrote a book on the subject, China's subsequent turn to \"market-based\" development under Mao's successors suggests that Mao was not completely wrong about the existence of pro-capitalist and anti-egalitarian elitism within the Party leadership. Mao's effort to defeat it via the Cultural Revolution – in Avakian's view – was thus heroic, even if it ended in defeat. In the view of many critics, the American RCP under Avakian's leadership has degenerated into a cult, yet it is worth arguing that some American radicals attracted to that cult are in fact inspired by some of the more egalitarian ideals of traditional Marxist socialism, couple with Mao's explicit ruthlessness about achieving egalitarian goals \"through the barrel of a gun,\" if necessary.\n\n**\"Democratic Centralism\" vs. Pluralism on the American Left.** In some Leninist organizations, a certain amount of debate – at least in theory — is allowed in formulating political goals and political policies. However, \"democratic centralism\" dictates that once debate has produced a political decision, generally determined by a formal vote, all group members are obligated to support the decision in word and deed.\n\nCritics of democratic centralism feel that in many cases, this effectively gives rise to censorship, to political purges and to the unquestioned rule of a small circle of activists, or even of a single charismatic leader. Defenders of democratic centralism, however, are likely to argue that it makes small socialist organizations much more effective than, say, DSA tends to be, where the right to debate is virtually unlimited and where no one is politically obligated to carry out decisions that an individual member finds disagreeable.\n\nPartly for this reason, \"Leninist\" organizations with strongly disciplined cadres can sometimes be far more effective in organizing demonstrations or carrying out political campaigns than democratic socialists are. Contemporary examples are provided by the numerically small Workers World Party and its recent spinoff, the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), which have sometimes achieved remarkable successes in organizing mass demonstrations.\n\n**Leninists and U.S. Mass Movements.** Some Leninist groups in the US – notably the Communist Party in its Popular Front days, and both the CP and the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party during the antiwar protests of the 1960s – have at times been quite effective in promoting mass movements to achieve reformist or even \"radical\" ends. However, many smaller Maoist and Trotskyist parties, mostly consisting of radical intellectuals devoted to the theory that a strong vanguard party is needed to wage the class struggle and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, primarily work to build their own revolutionary organizations.\n\nThese smaller Leninist groups tend to reject \"reformist\" activism which, in their opinion, will only make capitalism more palatable. Also many Trotskyists and Maoists, and indeed some democratic socialists within the Socialist Party, see cooperation with mainstream political forces, such as the Democratic Party, as being inherently \"revisionist\" and anti-revolutionary.\n\n**DSA: A Pluralist Organization, Incorporating Idealists and Materialists; Religious and Atheist Socialists; and Reformists, Liberals and Would-Be Revolutionaries**. Within DSA and within the Socialist Party, there are some members who see the \"reform-revolution\" dichotomy as a false one, in part because we are not in a revolutionary moment and the American working class today is fragmented and unorganized, not yet a revolutionary \"subject\" fit for changing history.\n\nHowever, there undoubtedly are some DSA members who embrace the \"revisionism\" of Bernstein, see moral idealism rather than economic crisis and class struggle as the impetus for a better future, and wish to reform capitalism rather than abolishing it.\n\nThus the Leninist accusation that DSA and other democratic socialists have basically abandoned \"socialism\" itself – as Leninists define it – has at least some plausibility. Yet at the same time, a significant fraction of DSA members who responded to a recent survey identified themselves as \"revolutionary socialists,\" a testament to DSA's sometimes bewildering pluralism as an organization.\n\nIn some ways, DSA shares what we feel are the best parts of the Leninist tradition – the Communist belief in mass work and building the social base that could move us towards democratic socialism, and the Trotskyist belief in workplace democracy and a more democratic state structure than that traditionally promoted by Communists. We also, however, soundly reject vanguardist politics and democratic centralism.\n\n**The Spartacus League and the Anti-Authoritarian Legacy of Rosa Luxemburg.** No discussion of the US left would be complete without some mention of the Spartacus League, a small and extremely militant Trotskyist group that many leftists find obnoxious and generally disruptive of attempts to forge progressive unity on key political issues.\n\nThe Spartacus League can indeed be disruptive of coalition work on the left, but in their name, at least, the Sparts harken back to the legacy of Rosa Luxemburg, the great German revolutionary who argued against Bernstein, who opposed the German SDP supporting World War I, and who later supported the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 while criticizing Lenin and Trotsky for their lack of democracy.\n\nLuxemburg not long before her assassination became involved with a group of militant German workers calling itself the Spartacus League. In 1919 they attempted an ill-fated uprising against the new Social Democratic government in Germany, and were quickly defeated and jailed – or, like Luxemburg herself, killed for their revolutionary efforts. Whether the Spartacus League of the US today is any more helpful to the wider left, or any more effective, than the German Spartacists were in Luxemburg's day is debatable. However, their name evokes a leftwing opposition to bureaucracy and undemocratic rule that is somewhat honorable, regardless of its practicality.\n\n**Background Readings, for the Curious, to this Mini History of Socialism.**\n\n****\n\nI happen to own the used books below and consulted them in preparing this overview of socialist history.

And I am among many in DSA who think we have a role in highlighting a tenable path through this confusion, rebutting as we do so the arguments of opponents. Eagleton's book, in its formal structure, provides responses to ten of the most common objections to Marx and Marxism. It's a handy but challenging work-around for us socialists – who want to perfect and extend that \"elevator pitch\" – to look at the pattern created by those objections.\n\nEagleton's strategy is to head each chapter with one of today's critiques of Marx as presented by the opponents, then take it on. These critics, as he characterizes them, are sophisticates of what they see as \"the increasingly classless, socially mobile, postindustrial Western societies of the present.\" (1) By their account, whatever utility Marx's analysis might have had at the onset of real industrial capitalism, it now lacks when applied to that \"classless... postindustrial\" environment we inhabit now. That's the first objection, and Eagleton's response is threaded throughout his book.\n\nThe second, and perhaps most familiar, objection is that wherever socialism has been put into practice it has been authoritarian, corrupt and a cause of misery to the working women and men it was supposed to rescue and empower. An explanatory coda to that objection is the oppositional meme that abolition of markets means a shortage of material goods, apparently the biggest contributor to misery. Certainly, the trailing clouds of mythology surrounding the Soviet Union feature views of empty shelves in the state department store GUM. Still, Eagleton points out, the cornucopia of material goods available to Westerners has if anything sharpened the misery of those who can't afford to participate. Instead, \"For Marx,\" Eagleton says in a later chapter, \"communism means an end to scarcity.\" (91)\n\nObjection three is to what is seen as the teleological determinism of Marx's \"iron laws of history\" – the inevitable succession of feudalism, capitalism and socialism, crisis to crisis. As such it is \"offensive to freedom and dignity\" and resembles predestination's elimination of free will. Eagleton's response is deft: Marx's unique contribution was to link class struggle to the successive modes of production, each changing the other. With that reciprocal formulation he is able to embrace many other critical insights of thinkers who came before him and engage them in the analysis, making it fluid rather than wholly deterministic. In Marx's words historical materialism is \"a guiding principle of investigation\" rather than \"a ready-made pattern.\" (51)\n\nEagleton acknowledges, though, that Marx's analysis of capitalist society in his time failed to envision \"the many ways (much more sophisticated in our own day than in Marx's) in which even a capitalism in crisis can continue to secure the consent of its citizens.\" (48) This concession is a crucial one, and may be the biggest challenge we face. It is, we can guess, why the book is titled *Why Marx Was Right*, past tense. The task of today's radicals, we should understand here, is to make those \"many ways\" transparent to the victims of that consent machine and to show that they are not random psychological bomblets but the coherent strategy of modern capitalism. In that respect, Marx's insights are anything but dated. Most of all, we must demonstrate to a wider public that this mosaic of capitalist constraints is not unbeatable, but can be contested by informed democratic resistance inside and outside the electoral sphere.\n\nObjection four, again a familiar one, is that human nature is too opportunistic, greedy and acquisitive to be compatible with a \"utopian,\" cooperative society. Eagleton's counterargument is a well-balanced version of the standard left riposte: getting there from here requires very non-utopian steps that march through reformist strategies, dodging (he quotes Lenin) the \"infantile disorder\" of being too pure for the slow pace of reform. When talking about tomorrow, \"a future which broke radically from the present would have us straining at the limits of our language.\" And he quotes Raymond Williams: \"...a culture, essentially, is unplannable.\" (74) Still, Marx \"treats the future... as a feasible extrapolation from the present,\" Eagleton observes. (102) There's a useful strand of critique that Eagleton doesn't directly follow up, here – the degree to which human nature per se gets confused with the behavior of humans in capitalist society. The economic basis of that society is designed to exacerbate, not ease, the acquisitive qualities in human behavior, by piling up fears – fear of job loss, fear of marginalization, even fear that the presentation of self is inadequate. If, as we see below, the coercive factor of scarcity (or threat of scarcity) is reduced or eliminated, \"human nature\" may be more adaptive than many can imagine now.\n\nObjection five: Marxism reduces everything to the economic, without allowance for \"the true complexity of human affairs.\" Objection six is Marxism's materialism, which \"drains humanity of all that is most precious about it.\" Eagleton's deft response to both these objections is worth dwelling on because we socialists don't always have a ready comeback here. Eagleton tackles the base-superstructure conundrum inventively by first pointing out the degree to which *capitalist* thought and behavior are themselves dominated by economics. He then argues that where capitalism values production for its own sake, socialism values it as human self-realization, and that production devoted to wage labor is an alienated version of that self-realization. \"Marx's work is all about human enjoyment\" (126) whereas we know that in the land of the free, our most unfree existence is in the workplace. In his beautifully compressed conclusion, Eagleton asserts that if Marx \"paid such unflagging attention to the economy, it was in order to diminish its power over humanity.\" (239)\n\nObjection seven, slightly harkening back to objection one, is Marxism's \"tedious obsession with class\" when, as Eagleton's anonymous Objector says, \"class matters less and less... there is more and more social mobility...\" Here, at least for the wretched first decades of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, Eagleton's Objector is a true straw person out of touch with the present. Eagleton argues that US notions of class, as the Objector frames it, equate class with style or attitude, not \"a form of alienation\" as Marx conceived it. (167) And of all the manifest differences between the economic society of Marx's day and ours of today, \"none of this has altered the fundamental nature of capitalist property relations.\" (171) If anything, the blurring of some class lines today has brought \"an increasing proletarianisation of professionals.\" (173-74) As the working class, broadly conceived, has swollen under the rule of an administrative-CEO class with the willing support of inherited capital, more than ever \"Capitalism cannot survive without a working class, while the working class can flourish a lot more freely without capitalism.\" (177)\n\nObjection eight is the inherent violence in Marxism's perspective on revolution and a claim that \"Marxists are not especially troubled by the mayhem their politics would unleash on the population.\" Eagleton points out the violence that revolution frequently sidesteps, paraphrasing Walter Benjamin that \"revolution is not a runaway train, it is the application of the emergency brake. It is capitalism that is out of control, driven as it is by the anarchy of market forces, and socialism which attempts to reassert some collective mastery over this rampaging beast.\" (187) Struggle beyond the limits of reform is a last resort, too – \"Reform is vital, but sooner or later you will hit a point where the system refuses to give way...\"\n\nObjection nine extends the argument of objection two: from a broad indictment of socialism's past as consistently authoritarian and oppressive of workers, the objection theorizes that outcome as inevitable. \"Marxism believes in an all-powerful state... socialist revolutionaries will rule by means of a despotic power...\" is the Objector's case. Eagleton argues that Marx was an enemy of the state as constituted in his day: \"The state as an administrative body would live on \\[under socialism\\]. It is the state as an instrument of violence that Marx hopes to see the back of.\" (197) In our day as in Marx's \"politics is in hock to economics.... \\[the state's\\] machinery already has a built-in bias to the status quo. Its anemic, woefully impoverished version of democracy suits the anti-democratic interests that currently hold sway.\"(203) Blanqui's feared phrase \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" that Marx adopts and posits as a successor regime means nothing more authoritarian than popular democracy. (204-205) Eagleton concede, though, that \"What Marx overlooks about power is.... there is an element within it which luxuriates in dominion for its own sake...\" – an assertion that Eagleton supports from Shakespeare, good critic that he is, but that may explain why so-called Marxist regimes have turned the model awry. (209)\n\nObjection ten finds Marxism an outmoded, overbroad early liberation movement that has now been supplanted by feminism, antiracism, anti-colonialism, anti-globalism and antiwar movements as well as other more articulated progressive movements like environmentalism that have no connection to socialism. Eagleton spends a good deal of space in this chapter on Marx's ambiguous relation to colonialism, which he sometimes saw as a variant of capitalist exploitation accelerating development of a working class in remote areas. But he argues that Marx's overall thrust was against nationalism, a mapmaking strategy that divides the global working class, though Marxism's modern exponents have also provided a mixed message on this issue. (222-223) Most modern liberation movements, Eagleton points out, recognize the role of the capitalist economy in maintaining the status quo and damping personal, social and identity emancipation. As for the critical relationship between socialism and environmental concerns, above all climate change, Eagleton quotes Engels' *Dialectics of Nature*:\n\n> ... we by no means rule over nature like a conqueror over a foreign > people, like someone standing outside nature – but we, with flesh, > blood and brain, belong to nature, and exist in its midst, and all our > mastery of it consists in the fact that we have the advantage over all > other beings of being able to know and correctly apply its laws.\" > (228)\n\nThe notion of socialism as a brake on runaway capitalism recurs as Eagleton observes: \"It is capitalism that sees production as potentially infinite, and socialism that sets it in the context of moral and aesthetic values.\" (235)\n\nTaken as a whole, the objections against which Eagleton sets himself comprise the familiar mix of misinformation and memetic certainty with which today's socialist left has to contend. Marxism, the critique says, is of its time only; whatever analytic value it had vanished with nineteenth-century industrial capitalism and doesn't apply to today's fluid, mobile capitalist society. Marxism's premise, that society will be governed by all workers, inevitably leads – always has led – to an oligarchy of a few and a corrupt and entrenched governing class lording it over a deprived and impoverished working class. The liberation Marx forecast through revolution has been accomplished with less strife by identity-based group action within democratic capitalism. That same democratic capitalism restrains (as socialism would not) the aggressive and selfish qualities embedded in human nature and affords individuals a chance to excel while bettering society through economic growth.\n\nThese are potent oppositional memes. Writing in 2010, however, Eagleton is able to counter with a certain amount of \"Nyah, nyah – how you like your capitalism now, buddy?\" And he does it superbly. But he takes the opportunity, as we should, to confirm Marx's notion that capitalism will never be immune from crisis because of its nature – it \"is incapable of inventing a future which does not ritually reproduce its present.\" (10) The \"creative destruction\" that most pro-capitalists acclaim creates mass misery today and created mass deaths in the past on a scale that surpasses Stalin and Mao, Eagleton asserts.\n\nEagleton's ten major critiques of Marx (and his successors, including ourselves) weave that difficult web of conventional wisdom that our elevator speeches often seem to bounce off. Those misreadings of Marx, accidental or deliberate, that find him rigid, antihumanist and uncaring about suffering and violence get a good roughing-up in this short book.\n\nEagleton provides, as we often do, some examples of \"actually existing socialism\" in northern Europe to belie the supposedly inevitable path to authoritarianism. In fact, we can note, the increasing authoritarian overlay of the US national security state on our happy little republic of material goods and covert inequality resembles Stalin's permanent-emergency \"war communism\" far more than it does either today's Sweden or the aspirational slave superpower of John C. Calhoun.\n\nEagleton's point-by-point argument against the major critiques of Marx's economic radicalism and radical humanism contain solid arguments we socialists can deploy against the conventional wisdom of capitalism's inevitability and consensual oligarchy. As Andy Feeney pointed out, he is also an Anglo-Irish professor of literature and can damn well turn a phrase. We don't want to overlook the effects of the poetry of radical emancipation when we make our elevator pitch.\n\nEagleton's arguments, or the ones we can formulate from this and other books, are no real substitute for exemplary socialism, even on a local or regional scale. Until we can take a hand in creating more survivable Mondragons, we'll need the poetry along with the materialist conception of history. One task for socialists, facing the latest and most complex crisis of capitalism as it literally eats the earth out from under its victims, is to enrich the argument that only democratic socialism can nonviolently unwind capitalism's convoluted doom trip and give us a soft landing in the next iteration of human society.","order":11},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—June 2014 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"June 2014","order":-1,"date":"2014-06-03","body":"Welcome to the June 2014 issue of the ***Washington Socialist***, the email newsletter of Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nOur postponed election to the local's steering committee was accomplished at the May meeting, and we welcome new SC members Ingrid Goldstrom and Kurt Stand.

And in the recently concluded battle over federal spending for 2015, it was an elephant fighting a donkey while, barely visible to the combatants, democracy in the District of Columbia got trampled – again.\n\nThe latest outrage against home rule was a rider in the spending bill, inserted at the behest of Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) to block Initiative 71, approved by 70 percent of DC voters last November, which would legalize marijuana in the District. While the debate in Congress featured salvos on banking, immigration and other national issues, few on the Hill had anything to say about congressional micromanaging of a local matter, even after DC activists staged a sit-in at the office of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. There were exceptions, such as Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who called the rider \"an offense to Americans of all states and Americans in the District of Columbia and all those who believe in our cherished ideals.\" And Eleanor Holmes Norton, DC's non-voting delegate in House, protested the bill vigorously. But few votes were swayed over the DC provision, and the bill passed.\n\n\"Here we go again!\" lamented Anise Jenkins, president and executive of director of the Stand Up! for Democracy in DC Coalition, which conducts educational activities in support of DC statehood. \"This is the second time Rep. Andy Harris has tried to stop DC voters from deciding our own laws on marijuana. It is strange how he 'forgets' he is being paid to represent the people who live in his district – Maryland's Eastern Shore — not to interfere with the rights of the people of the District of Columbia! Is it time to remind him?\"\n\nBy now, residents of the District are getting used to Congress interfering in local affairs, though no happier about it. After DC voters approved a measure in 1998 to allow marijuana for medical purposes, Congress blocked its implementation for 10 years. Past riders have included a ban on local funding for needle exchange programs designed to prevent the spread of HIV, which was lifted in 2007 but not until after more than [*15,000 DC residents, or 3 percent of the population, had contracted HIV – a rate as high as some West African nations*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/14/AR2009031402176.html?sid=ST2009031402211). In 2011 President Obama acceded to a demand from Republicans to prohibit the District from funding abortions for poor women, which sparked protests that resulted in numerous DC residents, including Mayor Vincent Gray, being arrested.\n\nWhy are certain members of Congress, almost always conservative Republicans, so eager to micromanage DC affairs? First, because they can. They have no such authority over their own states or any states, but the Constitution gives Congress legislative authority over the federal district. This makes the DC budget part of the annual federal appropriations morass, even though the majority of funds at issue are raised through local taxes. Secondly, the DC laws that have come into their sights are generally measures favored by progressives. The marijuana initiative, for example, gained most traction locally as a measure for racial justice, since African Americans bear the brunt of enforcement of the drug laws although whites are about as likely to be marijuana users, according to the [*DC Cannabis Campaign.*](http://dcmj.org/) Therefore, conservative opposition to marijuana legalization in the District not only allows politicians to posture as being tough on drugs, it also allows them to engage in a subtle form of \"dog-whistle politics,\" signaling to their mostly white constituencies that they're happy to keep sending black youths to prison for minor drug infractions – all without overtly mentioning race.\n\nThe 2011 protest portended a less pliant District government, tired of four decades of watered-down \"home rule\" in which elected officials have been forced to govern with Congress looking over their shoulders. In 2012, voters approved a DC Council-sponsored referendum in favor of freeing the local budget from the federal appropriations process, although the Gray administration, spurred by DC Attorney General Irving Nathan's legal objections, has been fighting the measure in court.\n\nThen, in the wake of Congress' interference in the marijuana initiative, the posture of DC officials increasingly turned to one of defiance. Both DC Council Chair Phil Mendelson and Delegate Norton said the District would move forward with legalization in the face of congressional opposition. Norton, for her part, said the language in the appropriations bill barring the District from using any funding to \"enact\" a reduction of drug laws is moot – the city had already \"enacted\" the laws by voting for them in November. Meanwhile, Mendelson said he would send marijuana legalization to Congress for the standard 30-day review and force members to either let it pass or proactively shoot it down, which could have the effect of further galvanizing the movement for DC statehood.\n\n\"Ignoring the will of DC votersis an obvious intrusion on Home Rule. Unfortunately, the Constitution gives Congress that powerand onceagain they are usingit in a cynical and undemocratic way,\" said U.S. Sen. Michael D. Brown (D-DC). \"The strategy to submit Initiative 71 to Congress should be pursued as an act of defiance but, in my opinion, it will not work. 'Exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever***'***is absolute***.*** The only real remedy for our situation in the District of Columbiais statehood. Only by becoming a state will we ever achieve 'real' home rule and become equal citizens of this democracy with the right to self-determination. Year after year we get attacked through the budget process. It's time to say enough is enough and stand up for DC statehood.\" (While senators and representatives from DC do not have votes in Congress, they act as elected lobbyists for DC statehood in their respective chambers.)\n\nSo the battle over legalized marijuana continues as only the latest front in the ongoing battle to free DC from congressional control. Given the continued penchant for congressional meddling, it's becoming clear that only DC statehood offers the full local autonomy that will cease congressional micromanagement once and for all. A statehood bill introduced by Norton in the last session of Congress gained numerous sponsors in both houses and a hearing in the Senate, but neither chamber voted on it. In the face of a more hostile Congress in the next session, DC activists and elected officials will be looking for a way to move the statehood struggle forward in 2015.\n\n*For a historical perspective on resistance to congressional control of the District of Columbia and the growth of the DC statehood movement, see* [**my article in New Politics Magazine. **](http://newpol.org/content/district-columbia-oldest-colony-51st-state)","order":0},{"title":"DISASTER CAPITALISM AND THE DISASTER OF CAPITALISM","date":"2015-01-01","issue":"January 2015","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"**A Review of Naomi Klein, *This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Planet* (2014) and *The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism* (2007)**\n\n****It's been a longtime, empirically grounded truth that when disaster strikes, those with deep resources – the haves – weather it better than the have-nots.

But it keys perfectly with her 2007 book *The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism.* That work outlined a designed sequence toward domination in the market-fundamentalist gospel of the University of Chicago's Milton Friedman and his disciples. Their quite amoral project involved imposing economic shock treatment as part of right-wing government takeovers in Chile, Argentina, Indonesia, post-Soviet Russia, US-occupied Iraq and Afghanistan – and post-Katrina New Orleans and the post-9/11 US.\n\nAs a complete ecology of domination, though, this was coupled with shock applied to dissident individuals and groups via \"disappearance,\" torture and psychological coercion. Klein saw a continuity between the malleability of peoples' behavior when they were deliberately destabilized in a psychological setting and the malleability of societies in times of crisis and instability.\n\nThe renegade Canadian psychotherapist Ewen Cameron's 1950s experiments on destabilization of subjects, including the excessive use of then-new electroshock techniques, drew the interest of CIA interrogation specialists. It led to [*the collaboration of psychotherapists*](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/health/architects-of-cia-interrogation-drew-on-psychology-to-induce-helplessness.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=b-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=1) in Guantanamo's horrors and the techniques used in Chile and Argentina by brutal juntas, some later trained at the US military's infamous School of the Americas. (*SD* 35-7)\n\nThe complement to these techniques was provided by Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys, always on the hunt for catastrophes that offered an opening to introduce market fundamentalism in as pure a form as they could. Klein has a caution for all here, though: \"The ideologies that long for that impossible clean slate, which can be reached only through some kind of cataclysm, are the dangerous ones.\" (*SD* 19)\n\nKlein distinguishes, in *Shock Doctrine*, between market fundamentalism and markets per se. Under many circumstances, \"A free market in consumer product can coexist with free public health care, with public schools, with a large segment of the economy – like a national oil company – held in state hands. It's equally possible to require corporations to pay decent wages, to respect the right of workers to form unions, and for governments to tax and redistribute wealth so that the sharp inequalities that mark the corporate state are reduced. Markets need not be fundamentalist.\" (*SD* 20)\n\nBut in the hands of the Chicago Boys, fundamentalism was the only gospel. The three-point shock doctrine was a political coup, shock therapy for a nonfundamentalist economy, and direct torture or psychological behavior modification a la Ewen Cameron. By Klein's reading, these were natural allies and their different individual devotees spoke the same language. \"The shock of the coup prepared the ground for economic shock therapy; the shock of the torture chamber terrorized anyone thinking of standing in the way of the economic shock. Out of this live laboratory emerged the first Chicago School state, and the first victory \\[Chile\\] in its global counterrevolution.\" (*SD* 71)\n\nFriedman and the Chicago Boys saw as their specific enemy \"developmentalism,\" a trend and national strategy particularly popular in the Southern Cone (South America) in the 1950s and '60s. Developmentalists engaged in state planning for industrial and extractive development, and nationalization was frequently on the table for the essential industries and enterprises: varying degrees of state socialism. So market fundamentalism became \"counterrevolutionary\" and was weaponized by US covert forces and corporate powers. \"In this new era, no one besides a handful of men in uniform needed to agree with them.\" (*SD* 78)\n\nThis three-pronged doctrine was spread by its success, the tacit or active support of US administrations, and the incentive offered to militaries throughout the Southern Cone to take care of their explicit enemies in a pattern made more famous in this century by terrorist paramilitaries. \"By the mid-seventies, disappearances had become the primary tool of the Chicago School juntas throughout the Southern Cone,\" with thirty thousand abductions in Argentina over the course of its military rule. As the Chicago/Shock doctrine became routinized for use in troublesome nations, Friedman formulated it succinctly: \"Only a crisis – actual or perceived – produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.\" The ideas that are \"lying around\" foremost in the public mind must be kept \"alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.\" Crises, Klein surmises, \"are... democracy free zones – gaps in politics as usual when the need for consent and consensus do not seem to apply.\" She believes Freidman and his cohorts took a lesson from Keynes, whose ideas were salient and ready when the Depression brought the crisis that made their implementation not only possible but inevitable. (*SD* 140-41)\n\nThe Chicago takeover of the IMF and World Bank in the era of the \"Washington Consensus\" – 1989-ca. 2000 – furthered the nonmilitary quality of disaster capitalism. The two mega-institutions were ready to provide capital under neoliberal conditions – low public services, high exports, tight budgets – as nation after nation fell into financial crisis at the hands of the rapid global mobility of capital.\n\nThe corruption of Deng Xiao-Ping's capitalist road and the Yeltsin-Putin regimes in post-1989 Russia, the African National Congress's betrayal of its own charter in the economic rules of the road imposed as the price of power and self-government all showed the shock doctrine in increasingly refined forms. But the formula remained: torture or similar one-on-one terrorism, a return to market fundamentalism and a rejection of democratic economic planning and suppression of popular support for a people-first economy.\n\nIn 1993 economist John Williamson, coiner of the term \"The Washington Consensus,\" told an international economics conference that \"it could conceivably make sense to think of deliberately provoking a crisis so as to remove the political logjam to reform.\" Deliberate crisis creation, Klein says wonderingly, was now \"being openly discussed.\" (*SD* 256)\n\n\n\nBut reform was not the only object; increasingly, the virtue of crisis – for Wall Street – was the increased access of US global capital to national markets that had been closed. When the Asian Tigers fell into recession in 1997, US industries and financiers snapped up huge family enterprises – *chaebols* – in South Korea. In the span of 20 months \"there were 186 major mergers and acquisitions\" in the SE Asian nations whose economies had come under siege, and the *Wall Street Journal* headlined \"Wall Street Scavenging in Asia-Pacific.\" Shock capitalism was fundamentalizing the globe's economy. (*SD* 273, 276)\n\nThe 9/11 attacks brought the shock doctrine recipe home to the US, and Hurricane Katrina provides a close-up model of the \"clean slate\" concept for refashioning usual democratic attitudes. The privatization of homeland security and then, in the Rumsfeld era, of the military put more and more power in the hands of corporations and financialist interests. Though she relates a fair number of instances of corporate-government collusion and outright corrupt practices, Klein argues that \"stories about corruption and revolving doors leave a false impression. They imply that there is still a clear line between the state and the \\[disaster capitalism\\] complex, when in fact that line disappeared long ago.\" (*SD* 315) The imposition of a Chicago-flavored constitution on Iraq's puppet Bush government exemplified this principle, once 9/11 had provided the disturbance that allowed homeland security to take center stage in the market-fundamentalist project. In Iraq \"all the careful efforts during the nineties to present 'free trade' as something other than an imperial project were abandoned.\" (*SD* 343), bringing what the *Economist* called the \"wish-list that foreign investors and donor agencies dream of for developing markets.\" (*SD* 345)\n\nAfter any natural disaster, authoritarianism at least temporarily becomes the go-to regime model for recovery. So disaster capitalism worked wonderfully well (for the capitalist elite) when natural disaster came to call. After the devastating tsunami of 2004, beachfront areas of Sri Lanka were slickly appropriated from traditional fishing communities and turned into tourist magnets. And Hurricane Katrina's obliteration of much of New Orleans offered (with the complaisant aid of the Bush administration) huge opportunities for taking autonomy away from longstanding black communities and even indulging one of Milton Friedman's pet projects, converting public schools to private.\n\nThe symmetry of Klein's argument in *Shock Doctrine* can make the reader suspicious – surely some other factors had a role in these nefarious takeovers of national economies? But the frequent surface crises often exhibit the economic underpinning that gained steadily through the Reagan-Thatcher era, went bipartisan in the US through the Clinton years and then went whole-hog Cheneyite and never looked back after 9/11. Klein's steady and credible reporting on this hidden pattern is persuasive. And the pattern instilled a slightly different and quite pernicious cultural strain of cronyism and opportunism in the US and the global financial world that took its cues from the US: \"Once you accept that profit and greed as practiced on a mass scale create the greatest possible benefits for any society, pretty much any act of personal enrichment can be justified as a contribution to the great creative cauldron of capitalism, generating wealth and spurring economic growth – even if it's only for yourself and your colleagues,\" Klein says. (*SD* 235) That steady shift in attitudes and practices, amounting to a hegemonic tightening of the corporate grip on US political life, led to the crisis that changes everything.\n\nThe ultimate, irreversible shock is represented by anthropogenic climate change in *This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Planet.* Again, as poor people and workers are back on their heels due to drought, food insecurity, and constant disruption of their living situation (especially the six hundred million living on vulnerable coastline), it's the corporate, moneyed few who can gain even more substantive hegemony. Klein sees that as a severe, transnational threat, with the global corporations already assembling their private armies to enforce the two-tiered society of the climate future (as already envisioned by Hollywood): elites in their bubble-like enclaves, and the helots struggling in a hellish new environment. (*TCE* 9) Klein's two books considered here, published seven years apart, nevertheless dovetail powerfully.\n\nThe lingering hegemonic power of market fundamentalism , Chicago-style, has created the worst-case scenario for dealing with the crisis of climate change. The growth-mad ideology of global capitalism, which accelerates the destruction of the climate, is also the political context in which that destruction must be contested. \"Climate change ... landed on the public agenda at the peak of free-market, end-of-history triumphalism, which was very bad timing indeed.\" And \"Market fundamentalism has... systematically sabotaged our collective response to climate change.\" Later, more bluntly: \"our economic system and our planetary system are now at war.\" (*TCE* 19, 21). Against that must come, she insists, \"a vision in which we collectively use the crisis to leap somewhere that seems, frankly, better than where we are now.\" (*TCE* 7).\n\nThe unexpectedly rapid growth of emissions, shortening the timeline for remedies, stems largely from economic growth in the emerging BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) nations in recent decades and illustrates \"the spectacular success multinational corporations have had in globalizing the high-consumption-based economic model pioneered in wealthy Western countries.\" (*TCE* 412)\n\nAt the Climate March in late 2014, DSA members and other left formations marched in the section of that massive turnout labeled \"We Know Who's Responsible.\" Despite the cacophony of climate denial from the Right, the responsible parties know damn well they are responsible, Klein demonstrates. One of her best reporting techniques in both books is to immerse herself in the forums and ceremonies of the confident and powerful. Covering a meeting of the climate-denying Heartland Foundation, she surmises \"these hard-core ideologues understand the real significance of climate change better than most of the 'warmists' in the political center, the ones who are still insisting that the response can be painless and gradual. ... when it comes to the scope and depth of change required to avert catastrophe, they are right on the money.\" (*TCE* 43)\n\n\"When climate change deniers claim that global warming is a plot to redistribute wealth, it is not (only) because they are paranoid. It is because they are paying attention,\" Klein says. Caustically, she adds, \"their dominance-based worldview provides them with the intellectual tools to write off huge swaths of humanity, and indeed to rationalize profiting from the meltdown.\" (T*CE* 48) And in respect to the wider resistance to climate change (including among workers, some unionized) she quotes Upton Sinclair: \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.\" (*TCE* 46) Other than the standard sniping at construction unions desperate for the meagre job fallout from the Keystone XL Pipeline project, Klein has regrettably little to say about workers, organized or not, as agents of change in the climate battle. Many unions, especially in the Southern Cone, were singled out in *Shock Doctrine* as victimized and destroyed by the triple whammy of full-bore Chicago Boys shock treatment; in *This Changes Everything* the focus shifts to other frontline communities.\n\nKlein has not only displayed the usual suspects in climate aggravation – deep sea oil spills, extraction regimes from fracking to minerals and tar sands exploitation – but she has reported on site from some of them. A Canadian, she gives special attention to the Alberta tar sands monstrosity and the First Nations peoples whose lands it is despoiling. The pan-tribal organization Idle No More is fighting energy exploitation throughout the country and providing a model for what Klein hopes will be the seedbed of a worldwide push-back against Big Energy. \"Resistance to high-risk extreme extraction is building a global, grassroots and broad-based network the likes of which the environmental movement has rarely seen.\" She calls it (as do others) \"Blockadia,\" a \"roving transnational conflict,\" and confers nationhood on it. (*TCE* 294-5)\n\nKlein seems to calculate that desperation overcomes inertia among frontline communities – in part because their grievance is tied to their ancestral land – and that will cause the \"mass jailbreak from the house that their \\[corporate-capitalist\\] ideology built\" (*TCE* 63)\n\nBut for the middle class that is the core (or potential core) of climate activism,\n\n\"What if part of the reason we have failed to act is not because we are too selfish to care about an abstract or seemingly far-off problem –but because we are utterly overwhelmed by how much we do care.\" (*TCE* 461)\n\nHere she touches on, but does not explore, the well-developed theory of \"threat communication\" and its degrees. When a looming threat is detailed in news or propaganda, it won't elicit action unless it falls into a perceived comfort zone: This is something I could do something about. If the threat is too low or too far away, no response will be triggered. If the threat appears overwhelming, exceeds perceived opportunities for activist agency, the message recipient likely will shut down and change the subject mentally. This is a critical problem for environmentalists of the left, who must couple the increasingly unpleasant science of climate change with the very difficult politics of remedying it.\n\nWhere Klein could envision well-regulated, democratic market society as a reasonable alternative to the Chicago gospel in *Shock Doctrine*, she is gloomier in *This Changes Everything* about the prospects of a democratic-electoral base for change because the hour is so late and so many opportunities have been lost. High-friction change in lifestyles and jobs, she asserts early in the book, will include a big role for authority, expert or not:\n\n\"There are legitimate fears too of what some call 'green fascism' – an environmental crisis so severe that it becomes the pretext for authoritarian forces to seize control in the name of restoring some kind of climate order.\" (*TCE* 54)\n\nBut to balance that she concludes\n\n...in the hot and stormy future we have already made inevitable through our past emissions, an unshakeable belief in the equal rights of all people and a capacity for deep compassion will be the only things standing between civilization and barbarism. (*TCE* 462)\n\n\"...there is still time to avert catastrophic warming,\" Klein asserts, \"but not within the rules of capitalism as it is currently constructed,\" an \"economic system that fetishizes GDP growth above everything else.\" (*TCE* 88) The current growth imperative and the level of waste and overconsumption that it demands, she says, give us an exaggerated notion of the actual lifestyle changes that managing climate change demands in its turn.\n\nDoes she have specific solutions, though? Klein's gloomy scenario requires resources for the reversal, and she proposes taxes on financial transactions, on the fossil fuel companies (\"before they are significantly less profitable\"), via a carbon tax and ending subsidies, and significant cutbacks in military spending in all nations. She synthesizes some polls deftly to show that public opinion would embrace taxes that run counter to \"our culture of lopsided sacrifice\" in which corporations skate the consequences of their own greed. And she neatly equates fossil fuel companies to tobacco companies, eventually to shift in the public eye from pillars of commerce to providers of poison, so that finally there can be \"a serious discussion about whether those \\[fossil fuel\\] profits are so illegitimate that they deserve to be appropriated and reinvested in solutions to the climate crisis.\" (*TCE* 355)\n\nEconomic clout can undermine law, though, of course. The failures of the promises made at abolition are examples. \"The fact that our most heroic social justice movements won on the legal front but suffered big losses on the economic front is precisely why our world is as fundamentally unequal and unfair as it remains.\" (*TCE* 455-458)\n\nBut Klein's imperative for lower growth in a framework of class equity is vulnerable to Elizabeth Kolbert's critique (*New York Review of Books*, Dec. 4, 2014, 14-16): Klein \"floats the 'managed degrowth' concept ... but... how this plays out she leaves unexplored\" and \"she vaguely tells us that we have to consume less, but not how much less, or what we'll have to give up.\" Kolbert herself acknowledges that if those burdened with first-world problems are actually informed what sacrifices are necessary, they turn to another subject.\n\nPlanning – industrial policy, \"picking winners\" – can make great strides against climate catastrophe, as Klein points out in the case of Germany. The planning required for combating climate change, Klein points out, is radically different from the centralized planning and mega-projects beloved of Eastern European governments during the Cold War or the World Bank and IMF of the \"Washington Consensus\" heyday. Instead, decentralization of energy production to the level of the residential rooftop solar installation gets most traction against emissions. The point here, a socialist reader might observe, is not to devolve the responsibility to the individual; the society manages for equity and the individual receives the programmatic benefits.\n\nFor a writer who is sometimes optimistic about our ability to slow and compensate for climate change, Klein shows a remarkable affinity with the skeptics of expert authority and climate science, scoffing at an international conference brainstorming how to \"hack the planet\" with technological solutions to \"suck the carbon out of the atmosphere.\" Certainly some of those engaged in these pursuits are moonshine peddlers, but the techno-optimists may be pointing toward solutions that would undermine Klein's reliance on stringent \"de-growth\" as a solution. Readers of Annalee Newitz's clever and well-reported book [**Scatter, Adapt and Remember: How Humans Will Survive a Mass Extinction (Anchor, 2013)**](http://www.npr.org/2013/06/07/189520183/how-to-survive-a-mass-extinction) get a more measured view of how current and future technology might make a difference.\n\nLester Brown has, likewise, converged both technology and political change for many years in programmatic books like [**Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization.**](http://www.earth-policy.org/index.php?/books/pb4) (WorldWatch 2009). In sequence, his model envisions 1.Stabilizing Population; 2. Eradicating Poverty; 3. Restoring the Earth's Natural Support\n\nSystems; 4. Stabilizing Climate. So the political comes first, not later or as an afterthought.\n\nKlein argues that the imperatives of fighting climate change and preserving a planet that can support humans will bring about the political changes that are necessary – a difficult argument to make, though not unlike Lester Brown's. The race between some form of socialism or the barbarism of a world of climate refugees and snugged-up elites all points to what Klein asserts is a threshold human event, but also is characteristic of the too-inspirational and less-analytical moments that mar her otherwise well-reported argument:\n\n...the climate moment offers an overarching narrative in which everything from the fight for good jobs to justice for migrants to reparations for historical wrongs like slavery and colonialism can all become part of the grand project of building a nontoxic, shockproof economy before it's too late. (*TCE* 154)\n\nLater, she adds:\n\nSo climate change does not need some shiny new movement... . Climate change can be the force – the grand push – that will bring together all of these still living movements. (*TCE* 459)\n\nAnd it will not be easy: the boat will be under renovation as the storm reaches its peak. \"There may have been a time when engaging in resistance against a life-threatening system and building alternatives to that system could be meaningfully separated, but today we have to do both simultaneously...\" (*TCE 405)*\n\nAs socialists, we have to be skeptical about what seems here to be magical thinking. Klein acknowledges the mass of well-financed disinformation surrounding the climate change question. But she seems to discount the social inertia that capitalism imposes through fear and the all-too-human resistance to news of future danger beyond the now – the real disabling of the individual and collective will to agency that is built into capitalist social practice. Those factors – which we socialists credit ourselves with understanding, and educating and agitating against – are the real danger to a resolute attack on climate change. Workers and their unions must be critical allies, and take on the fight because their old enemies the bosses are also the ones devaluing any pay or benefits raise they win at the bargaining table by wrecking the planet on which they make their living. Klein is clear that alternative energy requires new kinds of job skills but does not dwell on how those will be imparted – or demanded.\n\nNaomi Klein has made a valuable contribution in these two books to detailing the role of capitalism – especially the market fundamentalism that is so hard to expunge – in promoting authoritarian regimes and inequality, as well as in generating the carbon poison that has already propelled us irreversibly into the era of anthropogenic climate change. She convincingly demonstrates that a growth-fueled economy is incompatible, and inimical, to a sustainable world. She has made it clear that the corporate powers of Big Energy and the free-market snake oil specialists will fight back – hard – and that existing governments are joined to them at the hip, with separation a monumental task. The fundamentalists have the advantage, and their theories have been (as Friedman put it) \"lying around\" ready to go to work whenever catastrophe occurred. The correctives for both a planetary civilization of inequality and a planetary disaster are, as she says, equally conjoined in concept, but the practical chore of keeping them in harness going forward will require a more intricate struggle than she has portrayed.","order":1},{"title":"Film: The Imitation Game","date":"2015-01-01","issue":"January 2015","author":"Daniel C. Adkins","body":"The film *The Imitation Game* chronicles key parts of Alan Turing's life associated with the birth of digital computing, and the breaking of Enigma, a cryptologic method used by the Nazis to transmit strategic intelligence codes in World War II. It also deals with institutionalized prejudice against gays, nerds, and women during this period in British history and how bypassing those prejudices helped win the war.\n\nThe subject matter is the brilliant life and work of Alan Turing and the English code breakers of Bletchley Park. The film has a true emotional core of those difficult times, although it did not adhere exactly to historical realities. It was well acted, and supported by relevant historical footage and CGI animation. One of the core storylines was how people think and how different mental modes can be used to create useful and needed ideas that benefit us all. This storyline was reinforced throughout the film. One historical point that was hinted at was Alan Turing's brain decline due to his choice of chemical castration over imprisonment, after he was exposed as homosexual and convicted under obscenity laws. He was shown not being able to do a simple crossword puzzle. His brain's decline might have been a major contributing factor in his suicide a year later at age 41, as he was not able to continue his work, which was a major driving force in his life.\n\nThe film claims that breaking the German code shortened the war by at least two years. This could be debated since in the beginning of the war **Ultra**, the code word for the intelligence source, was not decisive because the allies did not have the forces to stop the Germans anyway. It can be argued that the reason Hitler lost was that he vastly underestimated the productive capacity of the U.S., Russia, and Britain. This underestimating probably had more to do with his racist ideology interfering with Germans' predictive skills.\n\nThe story of how **Ultra** was used is fascinating, but was only used as a backdrop. The film showed the code breaker group making the agonizing decision to not tell an allied convoy' commanders they were about to be attacked, because it would not help the war effort if the Germans knew that the Enigma Code had been broken. Yet **Ultra** intercepts were used to reroute convoys. What did happen in WWII was that the British city of Coventry was not warned when **Ultra** intercepted the plan to bomb it. It was deemed that the Germans would realize their codes were broken. The history purist may be slightly disappointed because the historical reality is so fascinating, but the medium of film is not able to tell an extensive tale, but can convey an emotional reality.\n\nA trailer for the film can be found at: [*http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/weinstein/theimitationgame/*](http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/weinstein/theimitationgame/)","order":2},{"title":"A Russian Hockey Film: The Red Army","date":"2015-01-01","issue":"January 2015","author":"Daniel C. Adkins","body":"The documentary *Red Army* is about the Russian hockey teams from the '70S or '80s to the present. It is appropriately called *Red Army* because all team members were officers in the real Red Army during Soviet times. The sole duties of these officers were to train and play hockey for eleven months of the year. The training was grueling, but also imaginative. The film follows team captain Slava Fetisov from team member, team captain, national hero, to political enemy.\n\nThe label \"Red Army\" has many meanings to Americans. It might mean the Russian revolutionaries as shown in the film *Doctor Zhivago*. For those familiar with World War II, the Red Army was the army that primarily defeated Hitler, while suffering millions killed and captured. Over 24 million Russian troops were killed or captured by the Germans. Others will remember the Red Army as occupying Eastern Europe and putting down rebellions.\n\nThe concept of sacrifice is a major part of Russian military history that carries over to its sport culture. What comes out in the film is that sport training was so intense that it marginalized the players' personal lives. The idea that winning was so important that the use of the most authoritarian means was justified also echoes the Red Army history.\n\nAn intriguing aspect to Soviet/Russian Hockey was that the playing style is very creative and cooperative. The main idea was to control the puck by continually passing the puck. The North Americans, instead, play a very individualistic and brutal form where individuals are valued for taking shots and scoring. The North American players were generally larger then the Russians and played a rougher game. The Soviets tried to win Olympic medals across the board, which meant that Russian hockey players were not the first pick among national athletes, or as large as many opponents. The Russian teams played a fluid game emphasized teamwork and passing partly compensating for the size difference. The Russians had to think differently to win. To this end, chess champions sometimes coached Russian players. This might have been influenced by collective ideology or that Russia has always had a significant intellectual history and culture. One example is that a Russian mathematician first identified the math behind U.S. stealth technology. The film has a surprise ending in that the team captain becomes a rebel and then evolves.\n\n*The IMDB website says RED ARMY will be in theaters in late January 2015*\n\n[*GOOD READS*](http://dsadc.org/good-reads-2/)\n\nThursday, January 1st, 2015","order":3},{"title":"GOOD READS FOR SOCIALISTS JANUARY 2015","date":"2015-01-13","issue":"January 2015","author":"","body":"A tough critique of capitalist assimilation of many environmental movements as represented by the \"Big Green\" national environmental movements.

I am lying here on a stone-hard mattress in a dark cell, around me the usual quiet of a cemetery; one imagines oneself in the grave. From the window, the reflection of the lantern – which burns all night in front of the prison – is drawn on the ceiling. From time to time, one hears, quite muffled, the distant rattling of a passing train or, from nearby under the window, a sentinel clearing his throat; he is slowly taking a few steps in his heavy boots in order to move his stiff legs. The sand rustles so hopelessly beneath his steps that the whole desolation and inescapability of existence rises from it into the damp, dark night.\n\n\"There I lie, quite alone, wrapped in those manifold black scarves of darkness, boredom, confinement, and winter – and at the same time, my heart burns with an incomprehensible, unknown inner happiness, as if I were walking over a blooming field in radiant sunshine. And I smile at life in the darkness as I were aware of some magical secret which might confute the lies, the baseness and the sadness and transform them into sheer brightness and felicity.\" (Letter written by Rosa Luxemburg to Sonja Liebknecht in mid-December 1917)\n\n\n\nIn prison the coming of Christmas, of the holiday season, is often a time of tension for it is a time when distance from family, from loved ones, is felt most keenly. On the other hand, the New Year is greeted more warmly; if nothing else each year done marks one less to do and often there is a momentary feeling of hope in an environment where such is otherwise in short supply. Something similar is frequently experienced in the world far beyond prison walls — the tension of shopping, of travel, of budgeting, of work, of managing expectations, boil up in the weeks prior to Christmas. Then comes the celebration, the fellowship and cheer followed quickly by New Year's Day with its resolutions, plans and hopes. Reality soon sets in, but the fleeting glimpse of getting from \"here\" to an individually glimpsed \"there,\" is real too. Though we don't each feel that way every turn of the page, it is common enough, and has been going back through the ages. Virtually every culture, every religion has some sort of celebration marking the change of year, marking winter solstice, which combines the fear of fallow crops and anticipation of rebirth and new growth.\n\nThat balance is a way to look at developments within our society in our own present. Certainly much has taken place that is cause for anger, if not despair. The police killings of African Americans in Ferguson, Cleveland, Staten Island, are signs of the violence that is too present in our society, violence which is too often countenanced with the impunity given to those who kill in an \"official\" capacity. The tragic assassination-style shooting of two police officers in New York on December 21 doesn't invalidate the truth of the injustice of racism and inequality; rather, it only underscores the need for systemic changes that ensure the promise of equality and \"justice for all.\"\n\nSo too, the revelations about rape at the University of Virginia – revelations that speak the truth notwithstanding the weakness of the *Rolling Stone* article that initially reported on it – because it speaks of a violence ingrained in everyday life and so accepted by too many as \"normal,\" even by youth such as those in Steubenville, Pennsylvania for whom rape was something that could be boasted about on social media. Violence of a sort that is normalized because it reproduces divisions of privilege and oppression that divide and redivide our society – and is then replicated in the violence our society engages abroad through what has become a state of permanent war. The seemingly unending parade of suicides by those who do the fighting provides a glimpse of the impact of our wars on those who fight them; no glimpse is allowed of the impact on the countries we invade where such costs are immeasurably worse.\n\nOf course, the Senate report on torture does provide such a view to those willing to open their eyes; although reports without action means that those culpable, those who give the orders, don't face consequences. Once again, the impunity of privilege raises its ugly head. All this in an \"improving\" economy which hasn't slowed inequality, has failed to stem the growth of poverty, and which has done little or nothing to overcome the insecurity felt by the vast majority of the 99%. Labor union strength continues to wane relative to corporate executives who accept no limits on power and profit. Conditions that speak to the need for progressive change, for radical change, yet conditions which instead saw reaction triumph in November's national elections, elections which offered little prospect for needed substantive changes in Washington DC, suburban Maryland or Northern Virginia.\n\nYet hope finds firm ground to stand upon in the coming year. The massive national climate change march a few months ago signaled the depth of awareness of the dangers environmental destruction poses that no amount of corporate money can hide; the ban on fracking in New York state is a reflection of the success that can be attained when people continue to agitate, educate, organize (as the IWW once preached and practiced). The massive outpouring of protests against police violence and racial injustice in the wake of the above mentioned killings contains the promise and possibility of more substantive change, just as the strikes and protests at fast food outlets, at Walmarts, at restaurants show that working-class action continues even with labor under attack – while minimum wage and sick leave gains across the country as well as locally are signs that victories can be won. And not just local victories. Obama's announcement of immigration reforms is a step forward for millions, notwithstanding all the remaining limitations on the rights of the undocumented. And the normalization of relations with Cuba, the release of the last three of the Cuba 5 from prison is an enormous victory in the name of peace, as well as being a simple step of human decency. Behind the President's actions lay the work of individuals, the strength of movements, that refused to give up and which will continue to push for a world of greater justice. Cause indeed to welcome the New Year.\n\nSo too for us in Metro DC DSA. We remain smaller and narrower than we should be, just as does our entire national organization and all organizations with socialist goals. Yet it is also true that those limitations were not barriers to increased activity last year, activity that gives us the potential to grow in numbers, in diversity and in rootedness, activity that itself exemplifies agitation, education and organization. Building our socialist presence locally is mirrored by DSA nationally. On-line meetings to analyze the relevance of Antonio Gramsci's writings to current challenges facing socialist organizations provided one forum to air opinions amongst active members. So too did similar strategy meetings that allowed members from across the country to engage in a process to refine and further develop DSA's perspective. Such discussions are signs of growth, a growth that is not taking place in a vacuum. Rather, it is part of an upsurge that may strengthen the presence of a socialist movement more broadly within the US. The DSA National Convention planned for 2015 will be a time to take stock and move forward by moving against the grain.\n\nBy looking for the next place to take a step is how we can both see, and see beyond, the disheartening and dispiriting news reports which greet us most days. However much power is still held tightly by corporate power while political initiative remains in most instances with reaction, opposition and alternatives grow beneath the surface and come up for light when nurtured and fed with the values of the world that could be. Thus, it is right to welcome in the New Year no matter the harshness of winter, no matter the harshness of our own or others current circumstances because it is out of the tragedies of the present that we can forge a better future – so long as we remember all sides of the world in which we live.\n\n\"Pessimism is cowardice. The man who cannot frankly acknowledge the 'Jim-Crow' car as a fact and yet live and hope is simply afraid either of himself or of the world. There is not in the world a more disgraceful denial of human brotherhood than the 'Jim-Crow' car of the southern United States; but, too, just as true, there is nothing more beautiful in the universe than sunset and moonlight on Montego Bay in far Jamaica. And both things are true and both belong to this our world, and neither can be denied.\" (W.E.B. DuBois***, Darkwater***, 1920).\n\n\n\nAspirations and fears, be they in 1917 and 1920, be they in 2014 or occur in 2015, are parts of the whole within which we live and create. Let us work in the days and years to come to give greater reality to the happiness and beauty that Luxemburg and DuBois and so many others saw and sought and so give content to a collective wish for a Happy New Year, to a world of peace and good will.","order":5},{"title":"Socialism and Rape","date":"2015-01-01","issue":"January 2015","author":"Carolyn M.

Women can really understand and identify with this analysis.\n\nPat Galligan (in *Feminism and Socialism*, 1972)\n\nRape was seen as a way to remind women that men were the dominant gender. Rape was viewed as a form of oppression that was used by men to keep women in their place in society. In this sense, society felt that women, not men, were responsible for their rape. The socialist feminist wanted to change the perspective that rape was not a crime against women.\n\nLaura Kramer (in *The Sociology of Gender*, 2011)\n\nRape keeps insinuating itself into our reality, this time by way of a *Rolling Stone* article ([*http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/a-rape-on-campus-20141119*](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/a-rape-on-campus-20141119)) and the aftermath it has caused at University of Virginia.\n\nOnce the November article appeared, UVA President Teresa Sullivan moved swiftly into action and addressed the fraternity culture blamed for the alleged gang-rape of the woman \"Jackie\" central to the magazine article. She suspended fraternities for the remainder of the school year and called on local police to investigate rape allegations, including the one involving Jackie ([*http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/22/us/university-of-virginia-sexual-assault-allegations/*](http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/22/us/university-of-virginia-sexual-assault-allegations/)).\n\nBut all was not well in the newsroom. As allegations of inconsistencies in Jackie's story surfaced, the *Rolling Stone* editors wisely turned the investigation of its journalistic process over to Columbia Journalism School, requesting a report of where their reporting and editing failed ([*http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/12/22/rolling-stone-farms-out-review-of-u-va-rape-story-to-columbia-journalism-school/*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2014/12/22/rolling-stone-farms-out-review-of-u-va-rape-story-to-columbia-journalism-school/)). The president of the UVA's Interfraternity Council has said that fraternities should continue their efforts to reform their system and to work with the university to stop sexual violence on campus ([*www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/u-va-remains-resolved-to-address-sexual-violence-as-rolling-stone-account-unravels/2014/12/06/66c0c780-7d64-11e4-84d4-7c896b90abdc\\_story.html*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/u-va-remains-resolved-to-address-sexual-violence-as-rolling-stone-account-unravels/2014/12/06/66c0c780-7d64-11e4-84d4-7c896b90abdc_story.html)).\n\nThe UVA story will go on a while and then die down at some point as all high-profile rape cases do, but the incidence and fact of rape will not, and its evolution as a central political issue of modern times compels us consider how socialists have weighed in on it over time.\n\nRape and its sister problem battering have been the anchor issues of feminism for half a century. Women began to rise up angrily against these widespread, largely unrecognized and certainly unpunished crimes in the early 1970s. New York Radical Feminists held a widely publicized public \"speak out\" on rape in 1971, and soon women across the country were staging similar events. The anti-rape movement built quickly, with women protesting police treatment of rape victims and the failure of prosecutors to prosecute accused rapists. Rape crisis centers formed, composed of volunteers who listened to women's stories and accompanied victims to police stations to report. Members of rape crisis groups had expanded their work by the late 1970s to include preventative educational programs in schools and trainings for police and prosecutors on how to work with victims. In large cities first, and then smaller communities, feminists instigated the formation of \"special victim units\" within police departments, and the placement of \"legal advocates\" in prosecutors' offices. State level networks grew across the country and by 1979, the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault formed and began holding annual conferences. Women would never again be silent about their assaults, and they had stopped letting men get away with it.\n\nOne structural problem facing women of that period was antiquated rape laws, which defined rape in ways inconsistent with women's assault experiences and thereby made it more difficult for prosecutors to build a case. Neither were women likely to report their assaults, fearing that no one would believe them and that they would be stigmatized, both\nby the criminal justice system and among those close to them. The legal\nsituation motivated the liberal feminist group National Organization for Women's legal team to organize a state-by-state rape-law reform campaign in 1974. NOW leaders used sophisticated media information and educated reporters to broaden public discourse, something that paid off with increased (and better informed) reporting. News stories began to incorporate new feminist terminology – sexual assault, violence against women, acquaintance rape, sexual harassment, etc. – and to carry a feminist analysis often in the voices of rape movement leaders and rape survivors. Statutes were indeed revised in one state after another.\n\nThe most far-reaching feminist analysis of the problem came from socialist feminists who situated violence against women at the intersection of patriarchy and capitalism. Sociologist Laura Kramer states that \"underpatriarchy, women were viewed simply as theproperty of men and not as individuals in society.\" Therefore, socialist feminists reasoned, when it came to the issue of rape, men felt that women were simply subordinates who had no rights of their own. For men, rape did not exist. While socialist feminists viewed rape as a form of oppression that was used by men to keep women in their place in society, they struggled at first to find its more specific connections to capitalism.\n\nMost male Marxists and socialists had been silent on whether and how class and sexual oppression coincided. Those few sources that did – e.g., Engels' *Origins if the Family, Private Property and the State*, Trotsky's statements about women in *Problems of Life,* *The Revolution Betrayed*, and eventually *Women and the Family* – were all focused on women's subordination within the family unit. None addressed sexual violence. Socialist feminists of the 1970s thought in bigger terms than their male comrades about women in society and questioned the ways that sexual violence (and women's fear of it) extended into other institutions, like the workplace, education and political life.\n\nSocialist feminists saw women as exploited not only at home (through labor and nurturance associated with the reproduction of the species), but as lower-waged, less powerful laborers in the workplace, and as absent from legislative bodies where public policies were adopted. Rape and other forms of sexual violence figured into the dynamics underlying these forms of subordination, and, because of that. And, according to Marxist political theorist Nancy Hartsock, \"we are dealing with a gendered power of relations based in what our culture has defined as sexuality . . . which must be understood to express the experience of the ruling gender.\" In language reminiscent of Marx and Engels in *The German Ideology*, Hartsock argued that the\n\nideas of the ruling class express the dominant material relations for other classes, so too we can expect that because of masculine cultural hegemony, these sexual dynamics typify some women . . and correspond to men's rather than women's experience.\n\nHartsock's theory of feminist historical materialism remains one of the clearest expressions of how capitalism and patriarchy work together to suppress women's power. The masculine cultural hegemony that Hartsock referred to was enacted not only through men's outright coercion (sexual assault and implied threats) but women's efforts to conform to masculine expectations to better assure their safety and well- being.\n\nSocialist feminists helped to bring to light to the social problems associated with rape, factoring in race and sexual orientation. In their analysis of the problem, men and women were divided in society, with white men being seen as the most dominant. All feminists – socialist as well as those from other philosophical positions – fought to have rape recognized as a crime, as a way to alleviate the major differences between men and women.\n\nThe more complex articulations of rape by socialist feminists remain with us today, but are little spoken about in public discourse, particularly in rape stories carried in the mainstream corporate media. Indeed, feminist voices of any stripe are less heard from today than in the earlier days of the movement, even as one rape scandal after another has emerged to consume the public imagination. This would be a perfect segue into a feminist political economic analysis of today's conglomerated news industry, but that is a topic for another commentary.\n\nA better place to end would be to make several observations. The first is that the anti-rape movement, which began in the early 1970s, has been an international movement, largely led by radical and socialist feminists who have seen the inseparable connections between gender and class oppression. The second is that this movement has produced measurable results in most countries in the form a new language and analysis of rape, in the reform and/or adoption of new laws, and in changes in gender relations. In the last of these, it is important to recognize women's important male allies, many of whom truly get it and feel compelled to speak up and work to stop sexual violence, and to create more egalitarian relations with women, both those whom they love and those they interact with in other capacities. This dialectical process has been slow but productive, and continues to demand the leadership of socialists who understand that women remain the majority of the victims of men's violence as well as the poorest members of capitalist societies.\n\n\n\n**Sources:**\n\nThe author drew from a number of sources, including *Feminism and Socialism* (Pathfinder Press, 1972); Nancy C.

These techniques include better batteries, and the use of ice, which can store energy when the demand is low at night. The stored energy would then be available during peak demand during the day. Batteries provide energy directly during the day's peak demand. Ice-Energy has created a unit, the Ice Bear, that uses electricity to freeze water at night, for individual large buildings and installations. During the day's peak heat, the Ice Bear is connected to air conditioning units via a coolant link for space cooling. When the ice has melted, the air conditioning unit operates normally.\n\n[*These techniques are currently being used by Southern California Edison*](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/22/business/energy-environment/california-picks-energy-storage-over-some-new-power-plant-bids.html), which has an excess of nighttime wind energy from windmills. If a utility bases its pricing on the time of day the energy is used, then the cost of these techniques can be compared to peak energy costs. An older way of meeting peak demand would be to use a jet turbine using oil or gas. A full-scale implementation of these, and other storage techniques, could decrease the need for a number of power plants that burn fossil fuels for energy.\n\nLocally, offshore wind energy in Maryland had been stalled by a [*Department of Defense (DoD) objection*](http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/navy-objects-to-maryland-offshore-wind-p-55592/) that offshore windmills would block needed radar scans. The defense worry was that the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, which tests aircraft, would not be able to observe those planes off Maryland Atlantic shore [*when wind turbines are in operation.*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-great-bay-wind-20141201-story.html) This objection may be negated when DoD tests two radar-detecting blimps around the Washington, DC area. The blimps are called aerostats because they are tethered and do not move freely. The first one can scan out to 500 kilometers. The second one has more precise radar and may make observation from the Patuxent facility unnecessary.

Overall, the local's members and supporters participated in more than 50 events that had been announced beforehand on our Meetup.com site. Individual members and supporters took part in several others that were not advertised on Meetup. These included a year-long series of conference calls exploring future strategies for DSA at the national level, a national conference of the Young Democratic Socialists (YDS) in August, and a three-part webinar led by veteran activist Steve Max on how and whether U.S. capitalism can escape from a slowly unfolding crisis in profit levels, slowing growth rates, growing \"financialization\" and rising inequality that dates back to the 1970s.\n\nWhen all the numbers are added up, Metro DC local members and supporters participated to some degree in at least 57 different DSA-related events during the year, or more than one per week.\n\nIn addition, the *Washington Socialist,* through various contributors published 11 editions of the local newsletter*,* which among them contained 98 different articles addressing a variety of subjects. On Metro DC DSA's Facebook page, which by year's end boasted 255 supporters, contributors posted hundreds of different items during the year, a surprisingly large fraction of these – but hardly all – being contributed by a single individual, the indefatigable religious socialist Michael Binder.\n\n**Introducing Our Socialist Book Group**\n\nA newly organized activity of Metro DC DSA this year is our Socialist Book Group, which began operations in the fall with the reading and discussion of Mary Gabriel's *Love and Capital,* a biography of Karl Marx and Jennie von Westphalen and their family, as well as a social history of the tumultuous times in which Marx lived and wrote and in which his daughters sought to carry on his work. A discussion of a second Book Group selection, Nick Salvatore's award-winning social biography of Eugene V. Debs, is scheduled to occur this coming Feb. 1.\n\n**Major Organizing Activities and Salon Themes of the Year**\n\nSummarizing the themes of dozens of different local-sponsored Meetup events and hundreds of newsletter articles and Facebook entries is a difficult task, but there were several major themes worth mentioning.\n\n*Labor and Electoral Politics*. One big focus of the local in 2014 was on local electoral politics and Metro DC DSA's involvement in it, a topic requiring somewhat extensive treatment further below. Another key focus was labor solidarity work, much of it through our membership in the Washington local of Jobs with Justice (JwJ) but some of it involving other actions.\n\n*Racial Justice and Black Radicalism*. Black socialist and radical thought was a frequent though not constant theme for the local in 2014, and a focus of several important events. At the end of the year, local DSAers turned out in large numbers for the Dec. 13 national march against police violence in Washington. A few DSA activists also took part in locally based organizing against the police targeting of black men in the weeks following the grand jury ruling in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nSignificant numbers of local DSA supporters also attended our August Socialist Salon on the Afro-Caribbean and libertarian socialism of C.L.R. James, a one-time associate of Trotsky who played a part in the Black Power movement of the 1960s and in earlier Pan-Africanist organizing that fostered anti-colonial revolutions in Africa following World War II. In a follow-up Salon, we also looked at the sometimes conflicted relationship between African nationalist leaders and Marxist socialists in the wake of successful anti-colonial struggles in various parts of Africa.\n\n*Climate Change*. Activism around climate change was a lesser focus of our local in 2014, but at least four Washington-area activists with DSA ties traveled to New York City on Sept. 21 to participate with DSA members from other areas in the huge national climate march that day. In October, we followed up on the climate march at our membership meeting with a PowerPoint presentation led by Statehood Green Party activist and Howard University professor emeritus David Schwartzman on the economic and environmental potential of a \"global green new deal.\" To some extent, climate change politics was an unexpected feature of Steve Max's national DSA webinar on the crisis in U.S. capitalism, for Max concluded that one way out of the crisis could potentially involve \"creative destruction\" (or in Marxist terms, a \"revolution in the instruments in production\") featuring the rapid development of green energy technologies in this society.\n\n*Feminism, Socialist History, and Media and Internet Activism*. In other general meetings and Socialist Salons, our local also examined the hidden socialist history of International Women's Day, studied the sometimes tangled history of the anarchist and socialist left since 1850, and focused on the threats to Internet openness posed by media mergers and proposed Federal Communications Commission regulations.\n\n*Movie Nights*. In an echo of that last discussion, a number of DSA members and supporters attended a special showing of the documentary film *The Internet's Own Boy,* outlining the inspired activism and sometimes tormented life of Internet rebel Aaron Schwartz, at the Lamont Street Collective in the Mt. Pleasant neighborhood of D.C.\n\nAnother special movie event that more than a dozen DSA members attended was a special West End Theater showing of *Citizen Koch,* a documentary on the role of big money and the Koch-funded group Citizens for Prosperity in derailing efforts by labor activists to recall Wisconsin's rightwing, anti-labor governor Tom Walker.\n\n*Legal Defense Work for Cindy McMillan of OWS Fame*. The legal defense of DSA activist Cindy McMillan, arrested during the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York a few years ago and convicted of assaulting a policeman who had grabbed her from behind at a demonstration, was the focus of a well-attended special event that local DSA members held in July.\n\n*Reproductive Rights*. Earlier in the year, a small team of DSA member supported reproductive rights for Washington-area women by participating in a bowl-a-thon and billiards tournament that the DC Abortion Fund (DCAF) put on as a fundraiser. Unfortunately, the DSA team this year did not do very well in the DCAF tournament finals, but we are hoping that with more practice, the recruitment of new talent, and a good deal of luck, we may do better in 2015.\n\n**Labor Activism in Greater Detail**. In support of labor solidarity and labor rights, local DSAers took part in a number of national and local events during the year aimed at bolstering the fortunes of organized and unorganized labor. The challenges that the U.S. working class faces given national and international economic trends was the focus in two Socialist Salons and several articles in the *Washington Socialist*, and throughout the year DSA representatives took part in several activities to promote H.R. 1000, a national \"jobs for all\" bill sponsored by Rep. John Conyers of Michigan. In addition to showing such theoretical solidarity with labor, local DSA members participated in scheduled meetings of the Washington-area Jobs with Justice throughout the year, and we contributed financial backing as well as attendees to JwJ's \"I'll Be There\" awards dinner in the summer as well as its Masquerade Ball at the end of the year.\n\nLate in the year, five local DSA members attended a [*\"Troublemaker's School\"*](http://dsadc.org/troublemakers-school-schools-activists-in-tackling-trouble-facing-progressives/) hosted by *Labor Notes* magazine and the AFL-CIO. At the local level, our local also had a representative present at rallies before the District Building in favor of two bills backed by the Employment Justice Project (EJP) and other local solidarity groups. One of these bills strengthens the legal protections available to low-income workers, especially recent immigrants, who are victimized by \"wage theft\" on the part of their employers. The other bill sought to improve the chances of people who have been released from prison being hired after serving out their sentences, by preventing potential employers from rejecting them without further question once they check \"yes\" in a box on an employment form asking if they have legal records. In late summer, the DC city council passed both the anti-wage theft bill and the ban-the-box bill promoted by EJP.\n\n*The YDS National Conference*. In addition to the activities above, several younger local members and supporters attended the national Young Democratic Socialists conference held in western Pennsylvania in August.\n\n*Social Outreach* – Putting the \"Social\" in Socialism. Then there were the purely social events that the local sponsored to attract potential members and give local socialists and interested outsiders a chance to meet in a progressive atmosphere without having to attend to any particular piece of political business. In 2014, such social events included monthly Socialist Happy Hours held the fourth Wednesday of each month in the District and newly organized Socialist Happy Hours for Northern Virginia, which were held later in the year in Arlington on the second Thursdays of each month. The local also held a very well-attended Labor Day picnic at the Lamont Street Collective on Sept. 1.\n\n*More on Our Local Electoral Work*. As mentioned above, electoral political work took up a large fraction of the local's time and attention in 2014. Early in the year, members voted for Metro DSA to support the candidacy of progressive restaurateur Andy Shallal, the proprietor of the Busboys & Poets restaurants, to run for mayor in the Democratic primaries. Later in the year, we opted to support the Rev. Graylan Hagler, a veteran social activist and one of the organizers of the Respect DC coalition to demand concessions from Wal-Mart in its siting of new stores here, in his run for an at-large seat on the District Council. We also supported open socialist Eugene Puryear, running on the Statehood Green ticket, in his bid for an at-large council seat. In addition, we endorsed Statehood Green candidate Joyce Robinson Paul for U.S. \"shadow\" representative, and two incumbent Democrats – Council Chairman Phil Mendelson and Delegate to Congress Eleanor Holmes Norton – for re-election.\n\nIn support of Shallal's primary fight, our local was only able to hold a fund-raising \"meet and greet\" event for the candidate. In supporting Hagler and Puryear, however, the local not only held \"meet and greet\" fundraisers for the candidates, but individual DSA members also canvassed for both candidates, both before the election and as poll workers on election day. Unfortunately, none of DSA's endorsed candidates except for Mendelson and Norton won this year, but our endorsements won the notice of both the *City Paper* and the *Washington Post,* and in the process of canvassing we came into contact with other local progressives who could become useful allies in the future.\n\n*Evaluating the Year's Activity, and Thinking About the Future*. Not every DSA event and activity our local engaged in this year was successful or well-attended, but some of us think we took major steps this year in giving Metro DC DSA a more activist focus. We also appear to have attracted a small but growing number of younger socialists, including women, to what, just a few years ago, was an organization whose meetings were almost entirely monopolized by older white men.\n\nTo make further progress in the future, members of the Steering Committee and a number of more committed activists met in November for a day-long strategy session on what the local hopes to do in 2015. Among our key decisions at the strategy session were to alter the format of our membership meetings somewhat to make them more attractive to would-be supporters, to focus our activism this year on a single campaign, a \"Fight for 15\" that will work for the adoption of a $15 an hour minimum wage in all three of our membership regions – DC itself, Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland. We also resolved to focus Salons and monthly membership meetings largely (although not exclusively) on labor solidarity work, feminism and the pursuit of racial justice.

The lagging recovery, only mildly helped along by the pusillanimous one-time stimulus program, has left a widespread sour mood among those who did not benefit from the corporate and Wall Street resurgence. Good politics seldom emerge from the electorate under those circumstances, but... may offer new openings for education. We can hope the new year will offer those opportunities. And — you may have heard this before — nobody said this would be easy...\n\nMetro DC DSA's January looks like this: Our **Jan. 10 membership meeting** will hear from Debby Szeredy of the Postal Workers, who will outline the privatization threat(s) they are fighting. The meeting is at 1 at the MLK main library, 901 G St. NW in room A9 downstairs. Szeredy, the APWU's executive vice-president, will speak first and questions follow. The membership business meeting is 2-2:30. The monthly **Socialist Salon** is the following Thursday, **Jan. 15** at 6:30 p.m.; local activists will lead a discussion of the electoral and governance prospects in the District and Maryland. It's at Hunan Dynasty, 215 Pennsylvania Ave. SE. And a **Happy Hour** is planned for 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, **Jan. 28**. Get updates on all these events – and others – on our [*Meetup page*](http://meetup.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=90c73a199a&e=003de9ccab).\n\n**IN THIS ISSUE:** [*WELCOME TO 2015*](http://meetup.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=342b4fcbea&e=003de9ccab): The local deftly postponed its membership meeting Dec. 13 to participate in the march against police violence on that day.

Andy Feeney's comprehensive and clear-eyed view of the Metro DC DSA local's activities during 2014 shows a surprising amount of work that took place, as well as avenues for improvement.\n\n[*CONGRESS VOTES TO BLOCK DC MARIJUANA INITIATIVE, BUT CITY VOWS TO FIGHT BACK: *](http://meetup.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=ee2ea6ebbf&e=003de9ccab)An Eastern Shore (Maryland) Republican Congressman – with a history of meddling in the District's affairs to please the home folks – has done it again. This time Andy Harris is trying to quash the D.C. initiative on marijuana. It's a hassle, but there are persuasive arguments that he was too late on this one.

Essentially, maximum freedom was enjoyed by imposing one's will on someone else. This explains a lot. Carolyn Byerly outlines the development of socialist-feminist responses to rape in recent decades and how it has cultivated the national discourse.\n\n[*SUSTAINABLE TECH ENABLERS*](http://meetup.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=bee696bf6b36570e5c2c2e83c&id=779945f05b&e=003de9ccab): As wind energy emerges as a main renewable source, other tech wizardry enables it to be more reliable and, perhaps, to keep it from being stifled by national security panics.

Pundits generally ignore the innovative potential of the working class, who are more and more incentivized to take any [*mentally suffocating job*](http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/college-grad-bored-work-fault/story?id=19704531) to pay down increasing debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The Heavy Chains of Debt*\n\nThe Intelligence Squared audience member's question echoes a general train of economic thought that seems to run through academia and business discourse: that [*the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few*](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business-july-dec11-makingsense_10-26/) allows them to take risks and innovate. These entrepreneurial endeavors lead to new methods to combine capital and labor, creating new employment opportunities, or so the story goes.\n\nThis is the justification given for the illustrious title \"Job Creator\" that is bestowed upon the heads of the richest Americans. However, a 2011 report by the Institute for Competitiveness and Prosperity showed that most jobs in the U.S. and Canada come from businesses under [*five-years old*](http://www.competeprosper.ca/uploads/ICAP_WP15_Final.pdf). Which means that older firms with the most money and capital aren't offering many new employment opportunities.\n\nHowever, to start a new firm requires a certain tolerance for risk. There is a plethora of academic studies that investigate the relation between firm debt levels and innovative risk taking. Indeed, a study by Andreas Milidonis and Konstantinos Stathopoulos in the Journal of Finance and Quantitative Analysis found that higher debt levels lowered the willingness of upper management to take risks.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this debt logic extends beyond existing capitalist firms to would-be firms. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [*reported*](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/student-debt-domino-effect/) that many university graduates cite student loan debt as a significant deterrent to starting new businesses. Even if someone is willing to take the risk, student loan debt may make it harder to get a lower-interest business loan. And as student loan debt exploded to over [*$1.2 trillion*](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/student-debt-swells-federal-loans-now-top-a-trillion/) in May 2013, this problem is not likely to dissipate.\n\nDebt is also compounding the socioeconomic immobility of the poorest workers. As traditional banks withhold loan services in low-income communities, payday lenders with annual interest rates of anywhere from [*391 to 521 percent*](http://www.responsiblelending.org/payday-lending/tools-resources/fast-facts.html) have inserted themselves into these communities. Although the Federal Reserve finds effect of payday loan on borrower bankruptcy [*ambiguous*](http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201381/201381pap.pdf), 90 percent of borrowers have to take out repeated payday loans at an annual cost of [*$3.5 billion*](http://www.responsiblelending.org/payday-lending/tools-resources/fast-facts.html) in fees.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that as the ability to start new businesses decreases for the working class – an ability that allows them greater control of the wealth of society – inequality will deepen.\n\nHowever, \"creating jobs\" is a political ploy, used by absentee shareholders to justify their wealth. From the socialist perspective, job creation should not be a societal goal. What is important is labor-saving innovations that *lessen* the aggregate *necessity* to work.\n\n*Less Debt, More Democracy*\n\nExploitative and unnecessary work continue if we allow a few indebted proletarians to become capitalists and begin the cycle over again. The typical \"American Dream\" rewards the successful small businessman/woman with the right to exploit their fellow citizens with underpaid employment. One may say this is a net gain – the business owner makes a profit and the worker receives a job – but it must be weighed against the alternative: a democratic business model.\n\nInjecting democracy into the grinding machinery of the workplace would allow the working class to take advantage of the entrepreneurial spirit of capitalism, while retaining the benefits for the workers themselves. Call it a worker-owned [*coop*](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/magazine/who-needs-a-boss.html). Call it a [*WSDE*](http://www.democracyatwork.info/articles/2012/07/wsdes/).\n\nI call it the seed of a new, [*more productive*](http://www.populareconomics.org/the-efficiency-of-worker-cooperatives-is-just-fine-thank-you/) and just economic system: a socialistic economic system.\n\nA national policy is needed to ease the debt burden *and* promote innovation. One solution would be to provide full or partial loan forgiveness to new graduates and debt-encumbered workers who decide to start new cooperatives. Debt could be forgiven after a certain period of time, similar to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program which forgives your federal student loan balance after 10 years of full-time government or non-profit employment.\n\nAnother solution could be to refinance excess debt with a low-interest public loan to new worker-owned cooperatives, with the option to convert the new loan into a grant after five years of successful business. This policy would incentivize people to create new value in society to lessen their debt burden, rather merely taking a job for the paycheck.\n\nHowever, policy theorizing doesn't mean that we can forget the political battle for working class power. Democracy is a difficult concept to attack politically. So if the capitalist elite attack the worker-owner concept, they also attack the idea of democracy itself. And if they bellow with hollow claims of \"anti-freedom\" and \"anti-democracy\" – against the rich, no doubt – we can respond like Piketty:\n\n\"I like accumulation; I like capital. I like it so much, I would like more people to own more capital.\"","order":0},{"title":"Bernie Sanders Can Win","date":"2015-07-13","issue":"Midsummer 2015","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"You read the headline correctly. I believe Bernie Sanders can be elected President.\n\nOr at least that's how those of us who support Sanders should approach his campaign. Not as a protest candidacy, nor as an exercise to burn off our activist energy and feel good about the country for a few months before becoming grumpy again once Hillary Clinton locks up the nomination. We need to envision Sanders and his explicitly socialist message resonating with Democrats participating in the party primaries and caucuses, and then appealing to the majority of voters in the general election.\n\nThis is not to deny that Sanders is running an extremely long-shot campaign, or that the Koch-led big-money political cartel will stop at nothing to bury him. Hillary Clinton will surely out-fundraise Sanders many times over, even in the event a few millionaire radicals join the Sanders cause. Sanders will always be disadvantaged when it comes to money. His advantage is ideas and, potentially, numbers of people.\n\nWhile money today is the biggest factor in who gets elected to office, it is not the only factor. If politics were merely a contest of who could compile the largest war chest, students today might be studying the presidencies of Nelson Rockefeller, John Connally and Steve Forbes. Ideas, and the voters' perceptions of ideas, matter.\n\nPolitical analysts have studied presidential campaigns (and those for lower office) in minute detail, and their conclusions differ widely about why particular candidates won, lost, or fared better or worse than expected. However, there is plenty of evidence that a progressive-populist message resonates with a wide swath of voters.\n\nIn fact, even many politicians whose past records in office show little fealty to true progressive or populist ideas feel the need to pretend to be men or women of the people when running for the Democratic nomination. Hillary Clinton, she of the fat-cat contributors, first lady of the administration that \"ended welfare as we knew it\" and tacked to the right at every opportunity, [*recently launched her 2016 presidential campaign on a firmly populist note*](http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/13/politics/hillary-clinton-roosevelt-island-rally/). \"Prosperity can't be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers. Democracy can't be just for billionaires and corporations,\" she declared to her supporters, emphasizing her support for a higher minimum wage, paid family leave, equal pay legislation and banning workplace discrimination against gays and lesbians.\n\nThat should surprise no one, since all Democratic presidential candidates must appeal to a significant bloc of voters on the left to win the nomination. Some progressives have defected to the Green party or become too disillusioned to vote, but to win in the Democratic primaries a candidates still must appeal to, or at least appease, the mass of left-leaning voters still in the party. Frequently this is more rhetoric than substance, as candidates from Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton to Barack Obama cast themselves in their campaigns as men of the people, belying their past centrist histories and thrall to wealthy donors that were more accurate predictors of their future actions. Hillary Clinton, to paraphrase the late Robert Young, isn't a progressive but she plays one on TV.\n\nJesse Jackson's campaigns of 1984 and 1988 demonstrate the potential of a prominent progressive running unapologetically on the left, not only rhetorically but substantively as well, in the Democratic primaries. In both campaigns, but especially the latter one, he built a coalition of people of color, union members, antiwar activists and others that made him a serious, if ultimately unsuccessful, challenger for the Democratic nomination. Some voters who might have been attracted to his message didn't support him because he'd never held elective office and others because of his race – not that they were necessarily hostile to having an African American president, but that they felt the country wasn't \"ready\" for such a momentous step. There were also efforts by Jackson's opponents to box him in as the \"black\" candidate, although his Rainbow message was pitched to a far broader audience. Even so, he was able to mount a serious run for the nomination. (Twenty years later, Obama attracted some of the constituencies that shunned Jackson – not only was he a senator and not as easily pigeonholed as a race candidate, but the result showed the United States was now indeed \"ready\" for an African American president, whether or not it had been in 1988).\n\nJust a few cycles earlier, in 1972, George McGovern's message of economic equality and his strident opposition to the war in Vietnam propelled him to the Democratic nomination against Hubert Humphrey, an architect of both the Great Society and U.S. entanglement in the war. Unfortunately, a combination of corporate money for the Republicans and Richard Nixon's dog-whistle racial appeals (McGovern wants to give your money to minorities, etc.) swamped McGovern in the general election.\n\nThe McGovern debacle notwithstanding, even in the general election Democrats have often found that taking a populist line plays to their advantage, in spite of the conventional wisdom that a Democrat must move to the right after the convention in order to woo undecided centrists. Humphrey in 1968 nearly defeated Nixon when he adopted an unabashedly progressive line in the campaign's homestretch. Likewise, Al Gore fared best when he dropped his cautious talk about a Social Security \"lockbox\" and challenged George W. Bush with more populist rhetoric – and Gore won at the ballot box. Michael Dukakis should have beaten George H.W. Bush in 1988, but his almost issue-free campaign and emphasis on his competence turned voters off like a faucet.\n\nBut perhaps the best precedent for a potential Sanders victory is not a presidential election, but the 1934 race for governor in California, in which outspoken socialist and muckraker Upton Sinclair – perhaps the Bernie Sanders of his day, if Sanders were to take up writing novels – made a successful run for the Democratic nomination. There are parallels aplenty between 1934 and today. Sinclair was running during the depths of the Great Depression, and he made the state's widespread poverty the centerpiece of his platform – he called his campaign the \"End Poverty in California\" (EPIC) movement. Likewise, Sanders is running at a time when the economic meltdown of 2008 continues to inflict pain on the majority of Americans, notwithstanding that the wealthiest Americans are doing better than ever. At least in Sinclair's California, nearly everyone was suffering the effects of the Depression; after 2008 the wealthiest Americans kept on getting richer.\n\nSinclair, like Sanders, was castigated by many on the far left for running as a Democrat. Sinclair had been a member of the Socialist Party up to 1934, when he switched to the Democrats in order seek the nomination. In 1934 the SP had much more vitality than today. The party was past its Debs-era electoral heyday, but it still was a force at the local level, [*with socialist mayors in several cities*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elected_socialist_mayors_in_the_United_States). At the national level, the charismatic Norman Thomas was the party's regular presidential candidate. Although Thomas' vote total was never more than a blip in the electoral standings, his 1932 platform included a number of planks that were adopted as part of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. So it was a great disappointment to many socialists when Sinclair ran as a Democrat, just as Greens and others who fixate today on the failings of Democratic officeholders expressed their dismay when Sanders did the same on the presidential level, rather than run as an independent (or a Green) in the general election.\n\nAccording to [*Sinclair scholar James Gregory*](http://depts.washington.edu/epic34/candidate.shtml), Sinclair took advantage of the weakness of the Democratic Party in a state in which Republicans outnumbered Democrats three to one, and he coasted to victory in the primary by appealing to working-class voters who had previously exercised little influence in the state's politics. But in the general election, a united front of corporate interests – led by the *Los Angeles Times* and Hollywood moguls – poured an influx of corporate cash into GOP candidate Frank Merriam's coffers and coordinated a campaign of red-baiting and disinformation that led to Sinclair's defeat, with 1.1 million votes for Merriam to just under 900,000 for Sinclair (see also Lauren Cooley's *Upton Sinclair: California Socialist, Celebrity Intellectual*).\n\nHowever, to a great extent, the EPIC campaign was a success, even if it failed to elect Sinclair. Gregory notes that\n\nCalifornia voters ...elected thirty-eight Democrats to the eighty seat Assembly, twenty-four of them EPIC nominees. Several EPIC endorsed state senators and U.S. Congressmen would also be taking office. In addition EPIC candidates had captured Democratic central committee posts around the state, giving the movement effective control of the party machinery. . .Sinclair's campaign marked the beginning of a powerful left presence in the party. Though EPIC itself melted away, veterans of that campaign formed the nucleus of a Democratic party faction that was ideologically very liberal and soon closely tied to organized labor, especially the left-wing CIO.\n\nSo a Socialist can win a Democratic nomination if the timing is right and he (or she) can light a fire in the electorate. But could Sanders, operating on a national stage, emulate Sinclair in winning the nomination, and then do him one better by winning the election? Or are socialists doomed to be relegated to winning local council seats in crunchy-granola towns like Seattle?\n\nThe odds are long. Even getting past Clinton, who will try to co-opt Sanders on the issues while quietly accepting corporate contributions, is a steep hill to climb. If he succeeds, corporations and their mouthpieces will declare all-out war in the general election. Money and red-bait invective will fly at Sanders like artillery fire. And if he is elected, Republicans in Congress will be no more likely to help advance his agenda than they were for Obama. It will require the building of an impressive coalition – of union members, ideological leftists, disillusioned Democrats, minorities, the poor and near-poor, and many others – as well as a savvy and well-organized campaign to push Sanders to victory. Sanders' platform speaks to the needs of a majority of Americans, and it will be the job of Sanders' supporters to break through right-wing disinformation to bring this fact home.\n\nHowever, like Sinclair, Sanders can accomplish much even if he fails to win, or even be nominated. Sanders is already attracting many liberal-to-left voters to his campaign, voters tired of the mainstream Democratic Party's sellout to corporate interests who now see an alternative to lesser-evilism, quixotic third-party campaigns or dropping out altogether. Like EPIC, a Sanders campaign could leave behind a reinvigorated left electoral movement, one that could move the Democratic Party and the national political conversation to the left. To make that happen, of course, depends on organizations of the left such as DSA recruiting Sanders supporters and keeping them engaged after the election.\n\nWe shouldn't regard Sanders as a \"protest\" candidate, running to make a point or pull Clinton to the left. If political action means anything in today's America, then we have to enter the Sanders campaign with the confidence that if his message reaches enough Americans loudly and clearly, they will respond. There is a path to victory for Sanders, albeit a steep, rocky one studded with landmines. But more fundamentally, the stronger a candidate Sanders is, the better are the chances of building a left political movement for the long term.","order":1},{"title":"Bernie Sanders's News Conference At the 2016 Democratic Convention: A Dream Vision","date":"2015-07-13","issue":"Midsummer 2015","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"\\[A transcript of Sen. Bernie Sanders's news conference as the Democratic National Convention opened in Philadelphia, July 2016\\]\n\nLet me say, before I take questions, that I am pleased to be here with the significant amount of support that has grown throughout the primaries. We expect to be competitive through more than one ballot of the convention, given the delegates we have won. Gov. O'Malley and I have largely fought for the same advanced progressive issues and policies and there are only a few where we differ; we are providing a pretty solid front for that program. Both my campaign and Gov. O'Malley's are well represented on the Platform Committee and we are expecting to see some changes in the final version put forward by the Platform Committee tomorrow.\n\nOur campaign continues to insist that this party, the party of working people, offer a very different vision of the future to the voters than the Republican plan for more wars, more corporate dominance, and more oppression of those now coming under the thumb of the billionaire class in this country.\n\nWe call for significant new constraints on financial commerce and a recapturing of its fraudulent gains through a financial transactions tax; a reversal of the Citizens United decision that has turned our electoral system into a casino; a move from the Affordable Care Act forward toward single-payer health care; a path toward free public higher education along with K-12 schools that bring all American youngsters to parity in readiness for college or work; improved prospects for manufacturing at home through industrial policy with opportunities for collective action by workers in the US as well as in all nations included in our trade agreements AND a $15 federal minimum wage; passing a real infrastructure bill to keep the national substance from crumbling any further and provide good jobs; raising the cap on the payroll tax to keep Social Security sound for the next century. Now that the President has had the Trans Pacific Partnership treaty turned down by Congress, we can begin to fashion a trade agreement that is good for workers, not for corporate lobbyists. And our criminal justice system has made baby steps toward reforms that can eliminate police terror in minority communities and end the selective arrest, prosecution and incarceration of minorities; we will pursue those goals vigorously.\n\nThose demands as a package can restore the health and political power of the American middle class, which has been crushed by the catastrophic recession caused by financial interests who paid no price for their criminal negligence but instead profited from the misery of the majority. Without a middle class that has that vigor and power, American politics will remain the dismal, gridlocked thing that it has become. Democrats must clearly state that those are our goals. Republicans simply cannot do the same, given the premises of their party.\n\nOur campaign has not only been about advancing all those policies and programs, but about clarifying for the voters that there is essentially a single reason that we need to address all those areas – the economic system in this country, which is stacked for the billionaires and against working people. Only by tackling all those factors comprehensively can we alter the economic arrangements so that we avoid the Whack-A-Mole dilemma of fixing one problem only to find that another problem has become aggravated as the capitalist system adjusts itself to maintain its advantage. The system must be reformed to benefit people, not corporate profits. And our increasing number of supporters indicates that that message is getting across as never before in recent history.\n\nWe recognize that Secretary Clinton leads all of us in delegate strength at this point but that no one has the delegates for the nomination. Whoever is the nominee, the solid progressive perspective is now firmly established as the stance of the Democratic Party, something it has been missing for decades.\n\nNow I'll take questions. Yes, in the second row...\n\nBABINGTON, AP: Senator, by this time in the campaign most candidates have settled on one, or at most two, major issues on which to run or campaign. You persist in going with this ... ah... laundry list. Why?\n\nSANDERS: You need to be systematic when you are taking on a system. The collapse of our infrastructure, our manufacturing economy, our educational system, our labor market and unions, our system of social support, our system for choosing our leaders – all those are tightly linked to the dominance of corporate finance. Most of these corporate people are not evil – this is the way the system behaves and they want it to continue to work to their advantage. To free them from their own bondage we have to change the system.\n\nLook, the arrangements that have developed over the years in our legislatures create the false impression that you can only do one or two big things at a time. This is false, but it is no accident. It plays into the hands of corporate bosses and the millionaire class because while you are trying to fix those one or two things, they are busy in the back rooms further corrupting and distorting – to their advantage — the rest of these factors that make up our everyday lives. If you want to make genuine gains for the American people, you have to push on all these fronts simultaneously.\n\nThe argument that the American people are not ready for change of this magnitude is easily accepted by many, including you folks in the media – but it has never been tried, not since the desperate years of the Depression. When you try to do those sorts of things when you are on your knees, you can change your perspective quickly. The real experiment is to accomplish these things when we are at least halfway still on our feet. I argue it can be done, and that the people will respond – they are responding.\n\nYes, in the back there...\n\nMOBERG, IN THESE TIMES: Senator, you ran as an independent and you call yourself a socialist. Why are you engaged with the Democratic Party right now? And a follow-up question.\n\nAs I have said, the Democrats have been responding a little too readily to Wall Street and corporate money in recent decades. This is not strange. When electoral politics gets this corrupted by big money, the corporations are the only game in town. If the Democrats hadn't played the game, if they had unilaterally disarmed, we probably wouldn't have had a two-term Democratic president. Things haven't been great, politically, but I can imagine them worse without that.\n\nNevertheless, the Democrats have traditionally been the party of working people, the party fighting big money, and they can be that again – are becoming that, right now, in this campaign.

Of these factors affecting the intellectual and emotional readiness of kindergarten students to learn, the most important is class, according to a recent research paper by Emma Garcia and Elaine Weiss of the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).\n\nA summary of their study, *Inequalities at the Starting Gate,* was presented to attendees at a June 17 forum and panel discussion on Capitol Hill sponsored by the Broader, Bolder Approach to Education (BBA), an educational reform group funded by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and other philanthropies and based on a public policy task force originally organized by EPI president Larry Mishel in 2008.\n\nIn the summary of *Inequalities at the Starting Gate,* Garcia and Weiss conclude: \"social class is the single factor with the most influence on how ready to learn a child is when she first walks through the school's kindergarten door. Low social class puts children far behind from the start. Race and ethnicity compound that disadvantage, largely due to factors also related to social class.\"\n\nThe implications for U.S. public schools and the children who attend them are daunting, judging from Garcia and Weiss's research and related materials distributed at the June 17 event. Some 46 percent of black children and 63 percent of non-English-speaking Hispanic children are currently living in poverty. Some 65 percent of black children are living in single-parent families, a factor that aggravates the educational drawbacks relating to poverty alone, and approximately 53 percent of Hispanic children lack access to the kinds of preschool programs that can help to counteract the effects of poverty.\n\nAccording to a brochure prepared under BBA's auspices and distributed at the forum, *Building High Quality Early Support Systems for Children and Families: A Guide for State Policy,* the demands by American politicians and prominent business leaders for \"educational reform\" are being voiced today \"in the wake of a record number of children living in poverty and a rapidly changing student population\" – factors that make educational progress hard to achieve for many students, regardless of whether the 'reforms' succeed. (Most progressives see the alleged reforms as thinly disguised attempts to break public school teacher unions, an issue the EPI discussion materials on preschool preparation did not explore one way or another.)\n\nThe incidence of premature births happening in the U.S. today compares with the incidence of premature births in the Sudan, *Building High Quality Early Support Systems* notes in passing. Uneven prenatal care regimes related to poverty therefore affect childrens' preparedness in tandem with other factors. Only half of the young children in the U.S. today are attending publicly supported preschool programs, vs. 84 percent in other developed capitalist nations.\n\nMeanwhile, the brochure charges, \"relative child poverty is higher in the U.S. than in every other developed country but Romania,\" making it hard to imagine how the U.S. will raise a future work force that helps this country to compete internationally.\n\nOn the other hand, participants in the EPI forum indicated that the good news is that some prominent U.S. business leaders and economists, as well as even a few Republicans, are increasingly willing to support national or (more commonly) state-level early childhood intervention programs that attempt to tackle the educational disadvantages of the least-prepared children, if only in the name of \"human capital\" development and economic efficiency.\n\nFor example, one participant in the panel discussion that accompanied the June 17 was Rob Grunewald, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, who has coauthored research on the economic costs to the wider society of poorly prepared, disadvantaged children being unready for kindergarten, and who has tried to calculate the economic benefits of programs promoting early childhood education.\n\nThe BBA's *Guide for State Policy,* in a similar vein, includes thumbnail sketches of promising early childhood education and childhood health care support programs that have been underway for years in some rather surprising states with reputations for otherwise very conservative politics.\n\nOklahoma, for example, boasts one of the nation's most extensive programs for providing free, voluntary, pre-kindergarten education to 4-year-olds, both from disadvantaged and from relatively middle-class families. During the 2011-2012 school year, the *Guide for State Policy* indicates, some 74 percent of Oklahoma 4-year-olds were enrolled in such programs. However, Oklahoma is only the second state to have established such pre-K programs; the first was Georgia.\n\nAnother childhood intervention program recommended by many early childhood education advocates, \"Smart Start,\" endeavors to provide high quality health care and childcare services to young children and their parents from disadvantaged backgrounds. North Carolina, another generally conservative state, has had a \"well regarded\" Smart Start initiative in place since the early 1990s, according to the BBA state policy guide, and now provides services to disadvantaged children from birth through the age of 5.\n\nIn 2002, North Carolina also supplemented its Smart Start initiative with a program called More at Four, which provides funds to counties to pay for pre-K educational services to 4-year-olds in \"a variety of settings,\" ranging from public schools and Head Start programs to for-profit community centers.\n\nArkansas, similarly, established a program in 1991 called Arkansas Better Chance or ABC, which by the 2011-2012 school year was providing pre-K educational programs to 37 percent of the state's 4-year-olds and some 10-percent of its 3-year-olds. Kentucky too now has a \"high quality pre-kindergarten program,\" thanks in large part to support from a \"broad leadership\" in favor of educational reform, \"including that of the business community\" and state philanthropic leaders.\n\nIn fact by late 2013, the *Guide for State Policy* relates, \"all but ten states and Washington, D.C., funded pre-K programs, though few three-year-olds were served and access and quality still varied widely.\"\n\nAnother briefing material handed out with the packets at the EPI forum makes an argument that well designed preschool educational programs and health care and parenting assistance programs for disadvantaged young mothers will more than pay for themselves over time. The short book by Timothy J. Bartik, a senior economist with the privately funded Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, advocates enhancing the social, emotional and professional skills of future adult workers, generating better health outcomes for children and future parents and reducing the chances that disadvantaged kids will end up in the criminal justice system.\n\nBartik's research, summarized in *From Preschool to Prosperity: The Economic Payoff to Early Childhood Education,* emphasizes the potential economic benefits of better childhood support and educational programs even to childless people who have no direct involvement with the public schools except as taxpayers.\n\nBartik also identifies three preferred forms of early childhood intervention programs that he says are of proven cost-effectiveness: \"universal\" pre-K programs for 4-year-olds; so-called Educare services for disadvantaged children, from birth through age 5; and Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) services for disadvantaged first-time mothers, to teach them parenting skills that will help them raise both their first-born children and all their children who follow.\n\nIf the best mix of these three programs were implemented nationwide at an estimated net cost of about $79 billion annually, Bartik's book argues, this investment would increase the present value of future earnings of affected children by \"a multiple of two and three times\" total program costs. What's more, positive \"spillover effects\" from the programs might be more than double the economic benefits to future adult wage earners in terms of higher incomes, and \"anticrime benefits might be at least as valuable as the earnings benefits.\"\n\nDespite the potential benefits of pre-K programs and growing support for such programs among state legislators and a part of the capitalist business community, however, federal funding support for good state programs faces an uncertain future at best given the current Republican control over both houses of Congress. And in their study, Garcia and Weiss argue that really effective cures for the adverse educational effects of poverty need to extend beyond the schools to addressing the problem of poverty itself.\n\nIn addition to funding and supporting good pre-K programs, they conclude, Congress and the White House should take several other steps.\n\nTheir recommendations include (a) raising the minimum wage; (b) supporting new job creation, both through Federal Reserve Board policies affecting interest rates and through government investments in infrastructure repair and upgrading; (c) sustaining and extending federal \"safety net\" programs such as unemployment insurance and food stamps to make sure they reach everyone in need; (d) reforming corrections policies so that fewer disadvantaged children suffer from having parents in prison; (e) reforming immigration policies that limit the life chances of Hispanic children; and (f) fixing \"societal and structural biases\" — notably including continuing residential racial segregation – \"that compound the effects of poverty for children of color.\"\n\nDemocratic socialists and other readers who are concerned about the future of American children, whether we are operating from an explicitly anti-capitalist perspective or not, may want to read more deeply in *Inequalities at the Starting Gate,* which can be accessed through the BBA web addresses here:\n\nA brief overview of the BBA can be found online at [*http://www.boldapproach.org/about*](http://www.boldapproach.org/about).

Similar systems of postal banking exist in [*some other advanced industrial societies.*](http://www.bna.com/banking-post-office-n17179892100/)\n\nMarc Armstrong, a cofounder of Commonomics, is one of the consultants working on a project to make U.S. postal banking a reality. Armstrong told anti-TPP activists participating in the conference call that the Postal Service, through its existing system for sending and receiving money orders, already has the capacity to provide banking services. However, its system for handling money orders is outdated technologically compared to that of Pay Pal, as an example, and it lacks a Federal Reserve bank-routing number such as those that commercial U.S. banks have. Under existing laws, the Postal Service is also forbidden from embarking on new business lines or offering new products without congressional authorization.\n\nIf these stumbling blocks were overcome, Armstrong said, the Postal Service could provide postal banking services that would provide a much-needed alternative to the payday loan companies that currently serve some 34 million Americans, at ruinously high interest rates.\n\nPeople with low incomes currently accept the burdensome terms offered by the payday lenders because they fear incurring extremely high overdraft fees at the hands of commercial banks. A national system of postal banking could help low-income workers and consumers to avoid both the banking industry's high overdraft fees and the high interest rates of the payday lenders, thus providing significant benefits to millions of households.\n\nThere are provisions in the draft version of the TPP, however, that would make the establishment of postal banking services and/or the establishment of publicly funded and operated banks more vulnerable to lawsuits than they are today. Such publicly operated banks could be deemed unfair competition with private enterprises and thus subject to TPP sanctions, Armstrong indicated.\n\nThe TPP also could limit how much the Postal Service can compete with private package carriers such as FedEx and UPS, Katherine Isaac, a special assistant to APWU president Mark Dimondstein, told conference call participants. Package delivery is an increasingly crucial part of the Postal Service's business, Isaac indicated.\n\nAlthough volumes of first class mail delivery in the U.S. have dropped significantly as people turn increasingly to email over the Internet, cutting into Postal Service revenues, the Postal Service today is delivering some 2.2 million packages daily for FedEx, its competitor. A significant fraction of UPS packages also are delivered by the Postal Service, for UPS and FedEx would prefer not to make deliveries in certain neighborhoods.\n\nUnder the Constitution, however, the Postal Service is obligated to provide service to the entire country. Its revenues from package delivery therefore are quite significant, and it would operate at an annual profit were it not for provisions in the so-called Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, passed by a lame-duck Republican Congress, that require it to pre-fund the projected health care benefits of its retirees some 75 years into the future.\n\nOne section of the proposed TPP, to the extent it has been revealed to the public, is designed to expand the ability of private enterprise to compete with government entities, Isaac told conference call participants. This might be interpreted as limiting the Postal Service's ability to compete with private package carriers. In addition, an annex to a separate trade agreement now before the World Trade Organization (WTO) would specifically restrict the Postal Service's ability to compete with private carriers on the basis of price.\n\nArguably, then, Postal Service employees and millions of Postal Service customers are potential recruits to the growing coalition aimed at blocking TPP's approval by Congress. Despite cuts in service and closings of mail processing centers that have been forced on the agency, the Postal Service still operates some 30,000 local post offices around the country and is the \"most liked\" of all federal agencies according to polling data. If a significant fraction of those served by the Post Office enter the political fight to block TPP's adoption, this could be a significant gain for the progressive anti-TPP coalition.\n\nThe APWU has launched a \"Grand Alliance\" to save the Postal Service from further cuts. *Washington Socialist* readers who would like to support the Grand Alliance, either by joining it as individuals or by urging organizations in which we are members to join it, can find more information about the Alliance at ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­[*http://agrandalliance.org/*](http://agrandalliance.org/) .

Puerto Rico's governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, contends that to pull the island out of a \"death spiral,\" the Commonwealth must be able to renegotiate payment on its roughly $72 billion in debts.\n\nDemocratic Socialists of America (DSA) calls on all political parties in Puerto Rico, the U. S. Congress, and the Obama Administration to join together to develop a long-term plan that addresses the root causes of this crisis.\n\nThe U.S. government should provide economic aid to help restructure Puerto Rico's government and public corporate debt so as to lower its debt burden and the costs of repayment. By refusing to consider such policies, political elites in Washington are guaranteeing that severe austerity programs will lead to brutal cuts in ordinary people's living standards. This lowering of the quality of life for ordinary Puerto Ricans aims to ensure that the wealthy holders of Puerto Rican debt are repaid. The repayment crisis is in large part due to a long-term economic crisis caused by corporate disinvestment from the island. Thus, the costs of restoring economic health to the island should be borne primarily by those who continued to profit during the crisis.\n\nDSA urges the broad social justice movement to work to ensure that our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico receive the federal aid that would allow them to emerge from this long-standing economic crisis in a humane and equitable manner. This can be done, but only if the federal government does not treat Puerto Rico in a manner analogous to how the European elites are treating Greece. The economic crisis has forced many Puerto Ricans to leave their homeland, with recent migration meaning Puerto Ricans will soon surpass people of Cuban descent as the largest Hispanic group in Florida.\n\nPuerto Rico is a U.S. territory with Commonwealth status whose residents, since 1917, are U.S. citizens by birth. Although its 3.6 million residents are U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans cannot vote in the U.S. general presidential elections because Puerto Rico is not a state.\n\nThe island's economy has been shrinking or stagnant for a decade, and the official unemployment rate sits at nearly 12 percent. Lawmakers in Washington and San Juan need to come up with a plan that addresses the financial and economic problems of the territory, which must include a lowering of the debt burden borne by Puerto Rico. The federal government failed to bail out a Detroit devastated by disinvestment by the auto industry; Puerto Rico must not be allowed to suffer due to disinvestment\nby biopharmaceuticals and other industries that have moved abroad in\nsearch of even cheaper production costs.\n\nBecause Puerto Rico is a territory, government-owned companies such as the electric utility are not allowed to restructure their debt in Chapter 9 bankruptcies. Twenty-five percent of Puerto Rican debt is held by these state-owned enterprises. Congress should approve a new bill that would allow these and other Puerto Rican government-owned companies, as well as municipalities, to use Chapter 9. Most Democrats support this legislation, but Republicans are steadfastly opposed. If need be, the entire government of Puerto Rico should be able to file for bankruptcy. States cannot file under Chapter 9, but Puerto Rico is not a state.\n\nIn short, the present crisis is the culmination of decades of U.S. policies that distorted Puerto Rico's political and economic development.\n\nAfter the United States conquered the island in 1898 as the result of the Spanish-American war, Puerto Rico's economy, which had been based on a mix of small landowners and subsistence farmers, was transformed into an agro-industrial economy dominated by U.S. companies. Later, in the 1940s, in Operation Bootstrap, U.S. policy promoted a manufacturing sector (combined with the forced sterilization of many Puerto Rican women) but one limited to manufacturing industries that benefitted U.S. transnational corporations. Puerto Rico was never allowed to define its own economic destiny by, for example, negotiating bilateral trade agreements; Puerto Rico also has had to adhere to fiscal policy directed\nby the United States. External control and extraction of profits stunted\nthe country's productive base. Recent changes in the U.S. tax code have caused the loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs and have been one of the factors leading to the current crisis.\n\nSixty percent of the island's population – over 2 million patients – receives their care through Medicare, Medicare Advantage or Medicaid. Puerto Ricans pay the same Social Security and Medicare taxes as the fifty states, yet Puerto Rico's Medicaid program receives a 70 percent lower reimbursement rate compared to mainland states. This low rate is being temporarily supplemented by a federal grant that will soon expire. As democratic socialists, we believe access to quality health care is a right, not a privilege; it is time to restore federal Medicaid reimbursement parity for Puerto Ricans.\n\nIn addition, the federal government has not adequately addressed the serious environmental legacy problems stemming from U.S. military exercises in Puerto Rico. There has been a decades-long pattern of delay and inaction when it comes to remediating the environmental problems that were left behind by the U.S. Navy on the island of Vieques and elsewhere.\n\nDemocratic Socialists of America calls on Congress to support the right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination, including the right to define their relationship with the United States in accordance with international law. The people of Puerto Rico must have a democratic voice in all issues and policies that directly affect them. We also urge Congress to grant Puerto Rico the forms of debt relief, debt rescheduling, and federal aid that will allow Puerto Rico to grow its way out of the long-term depression in a manner that enhances the quality of life of all residents of the island, not just its elite.\n\n\n\nPassed by the DSA National Political Committee: July 2, 2015.","order":6},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—Midsummer 2015 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"Midsummer 2015","order":-1,"date":"2015-07-15","body":"**Welcome to the midsummer edition of the *Washington Socialist***, the monthly email newsletter of the Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nAs has become traditional (for at least two years!) our midsummer issue, covering July and August, is published on Bastille Day.

Recognizing how Montgomery can be a bellwether for the state, a robust coalition of county and state organizations and unions led by the Baltimore-based [*Jobs Opportunity Task Force/Working Matters*](http://www.jotf.org/) coalition worked the issue hard and coordinated closely, meeting with council members both friendly and hostile and defusing potential problems as the bill proceeded through committee consideration to a full vote with remarkable speed. Your correspondent, a volunteer peripheral observer to this operation, was stunned and thrilled to watch the pros at work. The good example of Montgomery, which may be replicated later this summer in Prince George's (though it may be a heavier lift) could set a tone for statewide success in the 2016 session.\n\n**ON DC DSA'S PLATE in July and August**: In a summer galvanized by Senator Bernie Sanders' challenge to the Democratic establishment, the Metro DC local is mobilizing with National DSA to support the avowed democratic socialist candidate via an independent expenditure, [**We Need Bernie**](http://www.dsausa.org/weneedbernie). (What's an independent expenditure? A political action for or against a candidate done without coordination with any candidate's committee)\n\nA training session for those wanting to be involved in *We Need Bernie* is scheduled for the local's **August special two-part membership meeting** Sunday, August 9, 2015, 1:30 p.m. to 4 at the [*Watha T. Daniel/Shaw Neighborhood Library (WTD Meeting Room)*](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1630+7th+St+NW%2C+Washington%2C+DC%2C+20001%2C+us) 1630 7th St NW, Washington, DC across the street from the Shaw-Howard Metrorail station on the Green Line. A visiting discussant (TBA) on the \"Evolving Politics of Climate Change\" (1:30 – 2:30), will be followed by a 1-Hour Training Session on \"How Local DSAers Can Canvass for Bernie Sanders\" (2:30 – 3:30). Check the Meetup site for updates as the date approaches.\n\nThe training session is recommended because DSA's enthusiasm for a socialist's campaign within one of the capitalist parties has to be tempered by election law. But trained DSA members can act as organized individuals on behalf of Bernie Sanders' candidacy at public events and the local will actively seek locations where that can happen – tabling, canvassing or leafleting. Watch the [*Meetup site*](http://www.meetup.com/DC-DSA/) for opportunities to engage in these activities, many of them on weekends at farmers' markets and the like.\n\nThe **Socialist Salon** in July (July 30) examines the white racist right that is the quasi-organized force behind individual instance of outrage like the mass murder in Charleston's venerable black church. It's 6:30 p.m. at Hunan Dynasty, 215 Pennsylvania Ave SE but (as always) check the [*Meetup site*](http://www.meetup.com/DC-DSA/) for fresh information; note that it is the fifth Thursday this month, not the third Thursday as it typically is.\n\nThe **Socialist Happy Hour** at Luna Grill in Dupont Circle takes place the day before the Salon, July 29. Relax and talk about socialism – or not – starting at 6:30 p.m., 1301 Connecticut Ave. NW.\n\nThe **Socialist Book Group** meets Sunday, Aug. 16 at 3 p.m. to discuss Steve Fraser's book, [*The Age of Acquiescence*](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Age_of_Acquiescence.html?id=s-9MBAAAQBAJ&source=kp_cover). The group meets at the Kogod Courtyard of the National Portrait Gallery, 8<sup>th</sup> and F. Streets NW right next to Gallery Place Metrorail station on the Yellow/Green and Red lines.\n\nThe **August Socialist Salon**, still in formation, will examine the sovereign debt crises of Greece and Puerto Rico, at whatever stage they are at on August 20, when the Salon will take place (likely 6:30 p.m. at Hunan Dynasty, 215 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, but check the Meetup site closer to the date).\n\nUpdated information on all these events are found at the Metro DC DSA [*Meetup site.*](http://www.meetup.com/DC-DSA/events/222712527/)\n\n**OTHER UPCOMING EVENTS OF NOTE:** *IMMEDIATE*: On our publication day, our comrades at DC Jobs with Justice [*hold a public hearing*](https://actionnetwork.org/events/workers-rights-board-public-hearing-on-just-hours) on \"just hours\" – giving more control over work hours and lives to workers who are currently at the mercy of arbitrary scheduling and unilateral management reduction of hours.

Lennox Yearwood of the Hip Hop Caucus (which has made climate activism a priority) discuss the growing urgency of the climate issue and ways of addressing it. Representatives of the People's Climate Lobby, the Sierra Club and the Nuclear Information and Resource Service were present in the audience.\n\nYet climate change was not the only issue under discussion. The conference, organized by the new populist coalition People Demanding Action (PDA), with the sponsorship of the Hip Hop Caucus, Progressive Democrats of America (PDA), Social Security Works and the People's Climate Lobby, was specifically designed to forge new cooperative links between largely white-led climate activism organizations and other groups, largely led by people of color, working on other social and economic issues.\n\nIn addition to featuring presentations on climate change, accordingly, the agenda included a speaker on chronic unemployment and the Conyers full employment bill (HR 1000) as one answer to it. Still additional speakers addressed the challenges of black and progressive voter disenfranchisement, environmental racism, mass incarceration, the desperate social conditions still affecting Native Americans on many Indian reservations, and the struggle for statehood for the District of Columbia.\n\nPeople Demanding Action billed the conference, which extended over May 8-10, as \"Building an Inclusive Climate Movement to Create Community Power,\" and one of the main panel discussions focused specifically on achieving greater diversity in the climate action movement. Panelists included\n\n-   Leslie Fields, a black attorney and former international director of Friends of the Earth-US, who currently serves as the National Environmental Justice Director for the Sierra Club;\n\n-   Jacqui Patterson, Director of the Climate Justice Initiative of the national NAACP and a cofounder of Women of Color United, which last year partnered with the NAACP to organize a Women of Color for Climate Justice Road Tour;\n\n-   Mark Magaña, the President and CEO of Green Latinos and a board member of the League of Conservation Voters; as well as\n\n-   Dr. Gabriela Lemus, Executive Director of the Progressive Congress (an independent nonprofit organization allied with the Progressive Caucus in Congress) and a former director of Policy and Legislation at the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).\n\nAdditional prominent speakers at the conference included Mustafa Ali, a founding member of the Office of Environmental Justice at EPA and current Acting Senior Advisor to the Administrator for Environmental Justice; Jay Winter Nighthawk, originator and host of \"The American Indian's Truths, Nightwolf, the Most Dangerous Show on Radio\" and a member of the national advisory board of Progressive Democrats of America; and Barbara Arnwine, president and executive director since 1989 of the national Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.\n\nStill other speakers of note included Ted Glick, policy director for the Chesapeake Action Network; Vermont state senator Ben Ptashnik, a former chair of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group and a veteran advocate for human rights and environmental protection, as well as a cofounder of Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility; Prof. Joel Rogers, an academic from the University of Wisconsin who has written widely on American politics and public policy and has advised such progressive NGOs as the Apollo Alliance and the Center for a New Democracy; Rev. Glencie Rhedrick, a pastoral minister in Charlotte, NC and a former president of Mecklenburg Ministries, a religious coalition of approximately 100 communities of faith; and Joel Segal, a former senior legislative aide to Michigan's Rep. John Conyers and a former chair of the Congressional Universal Health Care Task Force.\n\nPerhaps the most dominant voice over the course of the 12-hour organizing session on May 9, however, was Rev. Yearwood of the Hip Hop Caucus. A retired U.S. Air Force Reserve officer and a Baptist minister, Rep. Yearwood is the founder of the Hip Hop Caucus and has been active in involving communities of color in environmental and climate change activism for several years. He also was key to organizing the Gulf Coast Renewal Campaign after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which blocked early rounds of illegal evictions of Katrina survivors from temporary housing and supported United Nations \"right of return\" policies for former New Orleans residents displaced by the hurricane.\n\nA coauthor with Tom Weis of a 2014 \"Zero Emissions Manifesto for the Climate Justice Movement,\" Rev. Yearwood has argued that \"because the climate crisis threatens all life on Earth, it is first and foremost a moral issue,\" and that the moral urgency of the crisis \"requires a rainbow coalition of people – reflecting the diversity of our great nation – coming together to solve it.\" He has also argued, in a 2015 article in EcoWatch announcing the PDA conference on building a more inclusive climate movement, that \"if the climate movement does not become more inclusive, the goal of transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy will not happen.\"\n\nThe modern environmental movement, despite having achieved \"incredible victories for the public good,\" is still largely rooted in predominantly white and rather elite communities and cannot command the massive social and political support needed to push the government and the economy toward the \"green industrial revolution\" needed to head off climate disaster, Rev. Yearwood also has stated. \"The movement needs to expand, and to do so we need to re-frame the issue of climate change to make it an everyday, every person issue.\"\n\nA major theme that Rev. Yearwood repeatedly returned to on May 9 was therefore that the largely white-led climate activism movement needs to become increasingly sensitive to communities of color, and along with several other black ministers at the event, Rev. Yearwood seemed to feel that it is therefore essential for climate activists to frame the climate issue in terms of morality, with less focus on scientific detail. Several other speakers also noted that in some cases, to engage ordinary people in the fight, especially in communities of color, climate activists might need to focus on related issues that affect people's everyday lives, such as high rates of asthma from exposure to pollutants from coal-burning power plants, or the childhood exposure to lead paint, and the mental damage this causes, that contributed to Freddy Gray's death at the hands of police in Baltimore.\n\nJay Winter Nighthawk, in introducing his remarks on poverty and social crisis in Native American reservations, stated that he is involved in defending Indian rights because \"God put me here to do a job. I'm not leaving here until I've done that job.\"\n\nSimilarly, in commenting on the political struggle to preserve democracy against rightwing billionaires like the Koch brothers, Rev. Yearwood's associate T.C. Muhammad, also active in the Hip Hop Caucus, cited the Koran in stating the \"the coal companies, the Koch brothers, I view them as midgets ... I don't view the Koch brothers ... as being in control.\" The nature of human beings is to seek justice, T.C. Muhammad added, and the nature of human beings also is to seek peace: \"That's why struggle will continue until there is justice along with peace.\" He also argued that Mother Earth will defend herself ... \"regardless of me, Mother Earth is going to win,\" which means climate activists can take up the fight for change \"believing that we *can* win,\" an essential belief if individuals are going to be serious about the struggle.\n\nJust how much the rhetoric and the political strategies of the white environmental activists attending the conference will change in response to such appeals is obviously unclear at *Washington Socialist* press time. It seems obvious that for some climate activists, appeals to God and the alleged inevitability of victory over the fossil fuel companies may be a little alienating. But the coming together of climate activists and advocates for other urgently important causes at the conference, under the organizing eye of long-time activist PDA executive director Andrea Miller, was intriguing and provocative. Conceivably, it may bring about significant changes in the largely white-based environmental movement and help catalyze the formation of a new multi-issue populist alliance in years to come.","order":0},{"title":"Creativity by Class","date":"2015-06-01","issue":"June 2015","author":"Daniel C. Adkins","body":"If human society is to be sustainable, it is time we evaluated how our various social-economic groups use their creativity to change society or not. Below is a quick view of different social class contributions.\n\nThe middle and upper middle classes cover a wide area but have created the crown jewels of our networked society. In addition to maintaining educational systems, small businesses, and much else, I claim that they have created the new corporations of our technological world. The companies – Microsoft, Apple, Google, and others – have been created by middle-class students enthralled by the opportunities of their disciplines, especially the technological ones. Steve Wozniak is the son of a defense electronic engineer who taught his son electronics so well that the Woz was able to build one of the first personal computers. Bill Gates learned coding so well that he was able to start a business. Steve Jobs got enough college under his belt that he was able to build a computer that was important in a cultural way as much as a business way. The Google guys created a company in the process of implementing their search algorithms. The companies that were created eventually grew beyond their initial technologies and often have used business techniques that are monopolistic. These techniques can be seen as part of capitalist market reality and \"creativity\". Markets are not stable and a successful company will try to control its market unless regulated not to do so. The values of these corporations often include supporting a sustainable future. Apple aims to be carbon neutral in the near future. The middle classes fulfill the professional and small business needs, often work for a sustainable future, and their creativity has created major corporations.\n\nThe blue collar or working class not only fulfills the needs of productions and services, but also has been the focus of the Quality movement. In older production practices workers were seen to be programmable by management instructions. The Quality movement's goal is to capture the workers' mental and physical efforts to create more efficient systems. Some firms do utilize their workers' suggestions and even reward them. In other industrialized countries such as Germany there are workers councils that let management and unions plan together and formally use workers' creativity. With the roll-back of unions in the US this joint structure is used very little. However much of the U.S. liveability (8 hour day) and welfare state came from the working classes' union history.\n\nMuch of the lower classes' creativity, however, is spent in just surviving. Sadly the economy is so rough on them that most do not seem able to thrive or rise. The latest news about the police shooting of young black men has noted that some police forces have used the law to raise money for themselves and have so limited mobility of locals that it is difficult for them to keep a job. We had hoped Jim Crow was gone, but it has just been institutionalized.\n\nThe 1% is well-educated and well-financed. There are divisions between old money and new members (innovators from the middle class). The 1%'s creativity can be seen as it uses its money to lobby Congress, rewrite laws in its favor, and use politics, statistics, culture, and psychology to manipulate elections to maintain and expand its corporations' profits. Congress has given business interests so much influence that the AFL-CIO and environmental organizations are not even given access to the proposed trade laws affecting Europe and Asia.\n\nThe 1%'s creativity has also gone into optimizing its cash flow from production and distribution of goods on a worldwide basis. The Wal-Mart example of this does provide low commodity prices, but at the cost of wiping out local businesses and paying such low wages that many of their employees need public assistance, making Wal-Mart the nation's largest welfare queen. Over the last 40 or so years the top 3% has gobbled up productivity so much that it owns 90% of US wealth. This level of inequality has not been seen since the Great Depression. A new report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation (major industrialized countries) links inequality with slower national economic growth. It states, \"In societies experiencing higher inequality, individuals might become less and less able to move outside the earnings class in which they were born.\" The financial sector has been so influential that it almost created a depression after dismantling laws designed to help prevent that outcome. Much of the climate denying comes from the fossil fuel industry, and it buys politicians who are united in making money the way they have always made it. The 1% is leading us toward a less sustainable and less democratic future.","order":1},{"title":"DEVELOPERS' DREAM: Our Region's Real Estate Future, as Washingtonian Magazine Envisions It","date":"2015-06-01","issue":"June 2015","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"If you think rising rents and gentrification pressures in the DC area are intense now, just wait. That's the unstated subtext of an ambitious April 2015 special report on the Metro region's real estate future in *The Washingtonian,* a local glossy magazine for the economically comfortable. With the cover title *Capital of the FUTURE,* this *Washingtonian* issue bears the subheading \"The Stunning Changes Coming to Our Region – And What They Mean for How (and Where) You'll Live, Work, and Play,\" and for some upscale readers, that is a more or less accurate indication of the report's contents.\n\nBut what senior editor Marisa M. Kashino and a half-dozen contributing writers then provide is mostly what the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and a number of prominent local development companies have in mind for this area, without much sense of what the changes envisioned might mean for low-wage Washington area workers, the homeless, many existing communities of color, and indebted recent college grads now working at relatively low-wage positions with local coffee shops and other retail establishments. What *The Washingtonian's* editorial staff has provided instead is an apparently well-researched glimpse of what the developers' plans and existing trends will look like at the 30,000-foot level, for a species of economic giants. And that's interesting.\n\n*The Washingtonian* unfortunately doesn't make its content available online except to paid subscribers. Therefore, DSA members and other local progressives who are interested in the magazine's forecasts will need to buy copies of the April issue, at about $5 each, or consult the magazine in your local libraries. But here are a few highlighted predictions:\n\n-   The population of Washington DC itself is projected to grow from about 659,000 people today to nearly 900,000 by the year 2040, according to the Council of Governments. Supposedly, the number of jobs available in the District will grow at a rate of between 6,640 – 10,143 positions per year between now and then. The higher rate of job growth would overtax the local housing supply and cause the District to run out of available land on which to build housing, creating a growth bottleneck.\n\n-   To meet growing demand for housing, the city probably will be able to convert some existing office space to residential housing, as local professional workers increasingly engage in telecommuting from offices in their homes in the suburbs and leave office space vacant for this kind of conversion. However, this won't be enough to solve the housing crunch. Therefore, the city will need to alter or eliminate the Height Act, which currently restricts DC buildings to heights of no more than 130 feet. There will be a need to protect the existing views of important monuments, *The Washingtonian* concedes, but when it comes to many other areas in the city, \"the Height Act has got to go.\"\n\n-   Senior editor Kashino sees a number of potential blocks to future business development in the District, notably a NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) syndrome aggravated by the existence of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions in the city, which help NIMBY groups to frustrate development plans. Add in the potential interference of the National Capital Planning Commission, Kashino writes, and \"You get a cumbersome, business-unfriendly building process.\" To cure this problem, the city needs to move toward a more \"commonsense\" zoning process that will allow for more mixed-use developments that facilitate greater residential densities.\n\n-   Also, Kashino suggests that local developers might emulate a major Long Island developer who has used \"crowd-source planning\" to win over or defeat the NIMBY groups, by giving pro-development residents a greater chance to comment on proposed projects electronically, without having to sit through long evening meetings where anti-development activists may dominate the proceedings.\n\n-   Outside of the District itself, *The Washingtonian* cites projections by local planners that envision extremely rapid population growth through 2040 in distant Stafford County and Spotsylvania County, Va., where a generation of \"New Ex-Urbanites\" are expected to settle in the future in hopes of finding large building lots and single-family homes. On the other hand, the cities of Arlington and Alexandria, right across the Potomac from the District, are expected to experience population losses – with Arlington losing about 14 percent of its existing population and Alexandria almost 4 percent of its population in the planning period.\n\n-   Next to Stafford County (projected population growth of about 141 percent) and Spotsylvania County (projected growth of 137 percent), Frederick County, Va., is expected to have the fastest population growth over the next two and a half decades, growing by almost 78 percent to some 146,000 people. Those Virginia and Maryland counties closer to the District should see modest population growth, ranging from a low of roughly 9 percent to a high of about 21 percent, and counties in the intermediate zone between the \"ex-urban\" counties and the inner ring should see intermediate growth rates as well.\n\n-   According to an article by *Washingtonian* staffers Michael J. Gaynor and Emma Foehringer Merchant, in distant bedroom communities outside of the District, \"bigger footprints that come with more green space\" will continue to have an appeal to suburban families, while in the District itself, increasing numbers of residents will live in \"micro-units\" – compact apartments offering as little as 344 square feet of space for their inhabitants. Some \"micro-units\" of this sort have been built already, and more are on the way.\n\n-   *The Washingtonian* also discusses a number of major real estate projects, both approved and merely proposed, that prominent development companies may build in the region over the next few decades. These include (a) a Southwest waterfront project, the first stages of which could be complete in a few years' time, that would add three hotels and some 200,000 square feet of retail space to the area; (b) a proposed park to be established along the District's 11<sup>th</sup> Street Bridge, providing a pedestrian-friendly link to an area around the old St. Elizabeth's Hospital grounds in Southeast, where \"the District has plans for a technology hub anchored by Microsoft;\" (c) a $66 million plan to redevelop the White Flint area along Rockville Pike in Montgomery County, Md., to include a 1-mile boulevard with pedestrian walkways along with 9,800 new housing units; (d) the proposed addition of a new span to the American Legion Bridge to reduce traffic congestion; and (e) a proposed \"Burnham Place\" building complex that Amtrak and the Akridge development firm are thinking about constructing over the current Amtrak rail yard behind Union Station. If approved and built, it supposedly would provide 3 million square feet of new commercial and residential space in the area and link to the ongoing redevelopment of the H Street Corridor.\n\n**For more details of *The Washingtonian's* projections, readers of the *Washington Socialist* really should buy or borrow the magazine's April issue, which also includes a long, thoughtful article on the spectacular rise of Tysons Corner as a major employment hub and an overview of an ambitious plan to convert it into a livable, walkable residential and commercial area with a population of up to 100,000 residents by the year 2050. According to Washingtonian writer Luke Mullins, the proposed 40-year development plan for Tysons, by providing extensive access to public transit for area residents, could even convert this traffic-clogged \"Edge City\" into a carbon-neutral area over time – unless powerful economic forces not wholly under the control of the developers throw the entire transformation into disarray, as they might.\n\nFor local socialists and other Metro DC activists concerned about the high human costs of gentrification, a useful and instructive contrast to *The Washingtonian's* rosy futuristic vision is offered by a far less glossy publication, the Spring 2014 Peace Letter of the Washington Peace Center. With the title \"Housing is a Human Right: Making Sense of DC's Housing Crisis,\" the Peace Letter makes note of the \"mass displacement of life-long residents and a subsequent spike in family homelessness\" that have attended the recent influx of high-income residents into the District and the rising rents and gentrification pressures they have caused.\n\nAn article in the Peace Letter by Will Merrifield on \"The Cost of Gentrification\" notes that as of early 2014, a DC resident would need to earn $27 an hour for a 40-hour week to afford a typical two-bedroom apartment in the city at \"Fair Market Rent.\" Someone earning the minimum wage, which was $8.25 an hour in early 2014, would have needed to work more than 130 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, to afford the same apartment.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, Merrifield's article adds, the number of low-cost rental units in the District shrank by 50 percent, while there was a tripling in the number of rental units costing more than the median rent. Meanwhile the District's waiting list for households seeking subsidized housing held some 70,000 names in 2014, and had been closed to new applicants. The result was that in 2014, and continuing through today, large numbers of low-income families and individuals – particularly older residents, people of color, and households headed by single mothers – have been squeezed out of the local housing market.\n\nPromises by local politicians, including DC's new Mayor Muriel Bowser, to address the problem through the construction or promotion of \"affordable housing\" also appear to have little chance of solving the housing crisis.\n\nThis is because, as the Peace Letter noted last year, the DC government generally defines \"affordable housing\" as housing that can be afforded by households enjoying between 50 percent and 80 percent of the Area Medium Income, or AMI. Since the Metro DC region includes five of the wealthiest counties in the United States, the AMI here in 2014 was around $107,000 annually. However, in the 2010 Census, roughly 20 percent of the District's population was recorded at living below the poverty line, at $22,314 a year or less.\n\nIn early 2014, again according to the Peace Letter, the average household income in Ward 8, the city's poorest ward, was around $32,000 a year. It follows that in the District under current housing policies, it is possible for the city or local developers to build \"affordable\" housing that a fifth of the population can't afford. The upshot, as Erin Burns noted in a graphic outline of the gentrification crisis in the Peace Letter, is that between 2000 and 2010, the District lost around 40,000 African-American residents to real estate displacement.\n\nConceivably, the brave new world of real estate development envisioned by *The Washingtonian* could eventually end this region's gentrification crisis and provide new houses for the growing local population of homeless persons, but it seems more likely that this kind of real estate development will make the crisis worse. As Marxist geographer David Harvey has written in his recent book *Seventeen Contradictions and the End of Capitalism,* speculative and not-so-speculative investments in land, rental housing, residential housing construction and other kinds of fixed assets offer capitalists a seemingly attractive alternative to investments in new industrial manufacturing and other forms of economic production in times of prolonged economic stagnation. As it happens, the US economy and indeed much of the world economy today are caught in what looks like a prolonged period of stagnation and/or slow growth. Meanwhile the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, in an effort to spur economic growth and prevent the stagnation from worsening, are keeping down interest rates and flooding the world economy with relatively cheap money – thus making it apparently cheap and easy for real estate developers to borrow large sums for big development schemes, even speculative ones. Could this be one of the less obvious economic forces driving both gentrification and large-scale commercial development in the Metro DC region, while rising rents are pushing low-income families in Ward 8 and elsewhere toward homelessness?\n\n**Additional Resources for This Story:** Patrick Madden and Julie Patels, investigative reporters for radio station WAMU, have compiled a report called \"Deals for Developers: Cash for Campaigns\" that outlines financial connections between local real estate development interests and politicians in the District of Columbia.

The films, music, art and walking tours open a window on the experiences, ideas, aspirations of individual workers and of their collective struggles. Two film events shown on successive evenings, May 11 and 12, speak to the larger achievement of the festival as a whole.\n\n**Fighting For Our Lives** was the first of these – a film re-released after 40 years, it was originally made as a vehicle for the United Farm Workers in the midst of a bitter dispute with growers in 1973. The film made by Glen Pearcy has the immediacy of a documentary made in the heat of battle. The UFW, formed in 1965, led a strike and national boycott campaign that led to successful grape contracts in California by 1969. This meant enormous real improvements in living and working conditions for those who labored in the fields, meant being treated by employers with the respect and dignity that should be the right of all. Union strength was growing and expanding throughout the fields, a circumstance that agricultural employers – powerful and wealthy – were not willing to accept.\n\nEfforts to organize farm workers had periodically been attempted since the late 19<sup>th</sup> century; all defeated by a combination of vigilante and police violence, court injunctions, employer-induced division amongst the workers and the ever-present tool of racism. It was just such a combination which meant that farmworkers (alongside domestic workers) were excluded from US labor law. And so it was a playbook that was again brought into use as the film documents — employers used court injunctions, (then) corrupt Teamster union vigilantes, racist local police departments and other measures to break the strike. Although the will of the workers was not broken, one can see the change of mood on the picket lines from an exuberant defiance to a grimmer determination. The film ends with UFW founder and president Cesar Chavez speaking to strikers as they prepare to go across the US and Canada to build support for a boycott (the film itself was made as part of that campaign).\n\nThe film gives us a glimpse of a campaign, but it also allows us to see something of the lives of the workers, giving a picture of people who then cease to be faceless. The three brief clips of movies still in production shown as part of the Bread & Roses: Filmmakers' Works in Progress at Busboys and Poets in Takoma Park –**Creative Feds**, **City of Trees, Can't Take it No More** – are documentary films which give voice to working people facing vastly different circumstances, yet workers trying to make their voices heard, asserting their dignity and sense of self. As the name implies, **Creative Feds** (directed by Erica Ginsberg and Leon Gerskovic) is about federal workers. Beginning with clips from newsreels and news shows that depict government employees as faceless bureaucrats who waste public money, this movie both reminds viewers of the vast range of works they in fact do, and humanizes them by allowing a glimpse of their pursuits apart from their jobs. The workers (all from different agencies) express their creativity through music, theatre, painting and thus as full human beings contrary to popular stereotype. Stereotypes of a different sort are used to paint an image of the supposed uselessness of people who live in blighted neighborhoods – in those neighborhoods west of the river in DC that gentrification has left behind. Often depicted with thinly veiled contempt or patronizing \"sympathy,\" they are rarely seen as individuals with stories worth knowing, opinions worth hearing, dreams worth acknowledging. **City of Trees** works to counter this. Directors Lance and Brandon Kramer document what happens when a non-profit makes use of stimulus money at the height of the recession by hiring local unemployed workers to plant trees in a neighborhood park. For the change that is wrought is not only about the acquisition of job skills, or about community engagement to make a nearby park safer, it is also about the affirmation and sense of self-worth those involved gain when given a kind of opportunity otherwise denied.\n\nA different focus comes in **Can't Take it No More**, which is a film about Walmart workers who are taking part in the struggle to force the company to treat employees with fairness, a commodity Walmart does not have on its shelf. Like all union campaigns, the workers' fight is about better pay, conditions, benefits – and is also about the dignity and respect to which all workers are entitled, whether they be professionals, janitors, retail clerks or, as seen before, if they work on farms and vineyards. The focus of this documentary, however, is not on the Walmart workers' campaigns or rallies, but rather on the lives of some of those most active in this social justice movement. Knowing something of the people engaged, who they are, what they experienced, what they believe, allows viewers to understand the human beings behind the Walmart workers fight for economic justice. All three of these films share in common with each other a focus on persons rather than campaigns or overarching issues – but that makes them just as, if not even more, political than films that speak of issues abstracted from human personality. And, indeed, corporate power recognizes that – Michael Bain and Kiley Kraskouskas, directors of **Can't Take it No More,** are involved in a legal fight with Walmart which is seeking to prevent the filmmakers from using the company's name in the picture's title. Making connections between work come around full circle, the screening of works in progress – of films not yet completed – put something of the craft of filmmaking on display and spoke to the growth of documentary film making in the DC Metro area.\n\nAt the same time, these films, in their own way, speak to labor struggles. Federal workers will find their livelihoods and conditions under threat if Republican regain the White House in 2016. The stimulus ran out and job programs such as those depicted in **City of Trees** remain the exception not the rule. And Walmart certainly will not give up its anti-union stance, will not stop squeezing its labor force without a bitter and determined fight. Understanding such challenges made viewing **Fighting for Our Harvest** all the more poignant and powerful. The UFW strike/boycott campaign of 1973-75 was only partially successful as the union was losing ground under assaults from all sides.\\* The political mood in the country had shifted, farmworkers were an early target as business and the right began a counter-offensive from which we all still suffer. But not all was lost. Conditions in the fields are better than they were in 1965. The UFW remains an active force in California, as does the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) in the south and Midwest, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) in Florida and as do other local and regional groupings. And the fight for justice, against racism and exploitation continues to draw strength from the victories and defeats of those who came before.\n\nPerhaps too solidarity is growing. The beauty of the three documentaries shown as part of Filmmakers' Works in Progress – indeed the importance of DC Laborfest as a whole –is that it simultaneously demonstrates the diversity of experience and outlooks of workers across our communities while also pointing to the underlying commonality of all working people. Only out of such shared understanding can the solidarity of labor be made into the force needed to win social justice. An extraordinarily moving sequence in **Fighting for Our Harvest** is in a sequence that moves from funeral to funeral of two workers murdered during the dispute, a sequence that moves from a Muslim funeral for an Arab farmworker to a Catholic funeral for a Mexican farmworker of the prayers and music of the one to the prayers and music of the other. What we see and hear is an expression of shared sacrifice that serves as a shared expression of hope for a better life in the here and now. That is the underlying meaning of Laborfest as indeed it is the underlying content of the labor movement when it is true to itself – and in that content lies our own hope for tomorrow.\n\n*\\*A correction was made here by the author June 1.*\n\n[*Good Reads for June*](http://dsadc.org/good-reads-for-june/)","order":3},{"title":"Good Reads for Socialists As June Kicks Off Summer","date":"2015-06-01","issue":"June 2015","author":"Occupy veterans.","body":"A mini-memoir in *Salon* by a socialist who was present at the creation... the story of how Michael Harrington came close to becoming a presidential candidate in 1980 while \"Waiting for Teddy\" ... this one made the rounds of the DSA activist listserv\n\n[*http://www.salon.com/2015/05/08/the\\_socialist\\_revolt\\_that\\_america\\_forgot\\_a\\_history\\_lesson\\_for\\_bernie\\_sanders/*](http://www.salon.com/2015/05/08/the_socialist_revolt_that_america_forgot_a_history_lesson_for_bernie_sanders/)\n\nNo doubt, this is going to be the Bernie Edition of \"Good Reads\" (and maybe not the only one).

According to an opinion piece by outdoor writer Christopher Solomon in the May 24 *New York Times,* the state for the last two years has allowed a private concessionaire, \"Pampered Wilderness,\" to offer high-end camping opportunities in its Millersylvania State Park where, for about $500 per weekend, visitors can enjoy \"amenities like flat-screen TVs or microwaves and fireplaces.\" Starting this Memorial Day, Solomon adds, Washington State also is offering \"glamping\" (for glam-camping) at the enormously popular Moran State Park on Orca Island, \"a jewel of Washington's park system,\" where tenting opportunities will run to as much as $220 a night for a minimum two-night stay on the weekends, with an extra $9 needed if campers want coffee delivered in the morning. The state park authority is reportedly considering whether to offer Wi-Fi to campers, too.\n\nOffering \"glamping\" to campers willing to pay more runs the risk of creating a class-divided camping experience for public park visitors, Solomon frets. Nevertheless, Washington State is turning toward it for two reasons. One is a fashion trend in private campgrounds that's been promoted by chic travel publications, including the travel section of the *Times* itself; the second is that the Washington state park system, which serves some 300 million visitors annually, has lost 79 percent of its public funding in six years, forcing it to lay off one-third of its employees. State promotion of \"glamping\" and the higher fees it can bring is one way to recover needed revenues.\n\nNationwide, Solomon reports, allocations for state parks by state legislatures have fallen by $250 million since 2008, \"forcing parks to cut operations or turn to other sources of money.\" Unfortunately this defunding process – which promises to make parks unaffordable to low-income Americans who may need them most – is still underway. In Wisconsin, notes Solomon, Republican Gov. Scott Walker \"has proposed cutting all state funding for parks,\" recommending that they rely instead on higher user fees and other existing revenues.\n\nFor more details, see Christopher Solomon, \"Our Pampered Wilderness,\" at [*http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/opinion/sunday/our-pampered-wilderness.html?\\_r=0*](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/opinion/sunday/our-pampered-wilderness.html?_r=0) .\n\n*–Andy Feeney*\n\nThe White House released in May a short (11 pages) compendium of findings about the national security implications of climate change.

Writing about the Save the Children report in the May 5 *Washington Post,* reporter Abigail Hauslohner observes that District infant mortality rates on average have fallen significantly over the last decade and a half – dropping from about 15 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1999 to just 7.9 in 2012, the last year for which firm data were available. In 2013, a preliminary report prepared by former Mayor Vincent Gray pegged the infant death rate at 6.6 per 1,000 live births – an \"all-time low for the city.\" But the figures cited by Save the Children indicate an infant mortality rate in Ward 8 of 14.9 per 1,000 live births in 2012, comparable to rates in San Salvador and Phnom Pehn, Cambodia. In Ward 3, in contrast, the rate for 2012 was 1.2 deaths per 1,000 live births – comparable to rates in Stockholm and Tokyo, and \"on par with the lowest infant mortality rates worldwide.\"\n\nSave the Children found a likely cause for the discrepancy, Hauslohner reports: about half of Ward 8's children are living in poverty, and the majority of the households in the ward with children are headed by single mothers. The stresses these mothers face during pregnancy in paying their bills and holding down their jobs probably contribute to the higher rates of premature births in the ward associated with greater infant mortality.

Bernie Sanders gathered at May's Socialist Salon to work on the details and constraints involved in individual and group support for the effort.\n\nSanders, who announced his candidacy April 30, has identified himself as a democratic socialist frequently in his political arc from mayor of Burlington, Vermont to US representative and then senator from that state. DSA members see big advantages in the introduction of the term into presidential politics – advantages for the political discourse itself, up to now capped at a largely neoliberal level and bottomed on the knuckle-dragging rhetoric of Tea Party patriarchy. Socialist organizations will also benefit from the entry of socialist perspectives on perennial issue areas such as inequality, health, income security and education.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in the *Citizens United* case changed the landscape in which DSA (and other nonprofits) can conduct electoral activity. [*\\[DD1\\]*](http://dsadc.org/2015/06/#_msocom_1)Though DCDSA held a very successful fundraiser for Sanders when he ran for the Senate in 2006, in presidential races a lot more distance is required to protect the organization's status. Our express advocacy, however, no longer has to be done solely through our PAC (but we cannot coordinate with his campaign). Until some legal questions are clarified, for instance, DSA will not do fundraising for Sanders as an organization, though members may do so as individuals. Members should feel free to encourage Democratic primary voters to support Sanders and explain this is a DSA position.\n\nMembers at the Salon agreed that activities both promoting the Sanders campaign (and emphasizing his leftmost policy proposals) and simultaneously raising the visibility of DSA as an organization were optimal. The group also discussed the fact that there are issues on which some DSA members might not agree with Sanders. Members agreed to a separate discussion in how to approach other Sanders volunteers on the differences between the Senator and DC-Metro DSA members.\n\nThe Metro DC DSA steering committee chose two members to be point persons in this effort. David Duhalde and Ross Templeton are both campaign veterans and will aim to navigate the local through the reefs and shoals of Federal Elections Commission (FEC) regulations.\n\nMembers at the Salon discussed the DC political terrain and what long-standing local groups might be allies. One veteran of the 1988 Jesse Jackson primary campaign, Kurt Stand, urged that the spirit of this one, likewise, should be \"to win\" not just pull a major candidate leftward, because much of Jackson's non-core support was galvanized by that spirit.\n\nThe national office has sent some preliminary guidance to locals about what they can legally do to boost both Sanders and DSA.\n\nDSA's support for Sanders has been explicit. The national organization website [*announces*](http://www.dsausa.org/weneedbernie) **\"Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) strongly supports Senator Sanders as the strongest candidate for President of the United States.\"** As always, the support includes critique: DSA national director Maria Svart, in her guidance to locals, said **\"**Our political goal is to generate support for Bernie through visibility and momentum, and do what we can to influence his campaign to have better perspective and platform around institutional racism. Our organizational goal is to GROW DSA so that after the election, we are significantly stronger and can continue fighting for democratic socialism.\"\n\n\n\n*Metro-DC DSA members at the May Salon. Photo: Nicole Hohler*\n\nSvart noted that there are a fair number of things that locals can do as locals, including creating forums or other events with titles like \"What is Democratic Socialism and Why Does Bernie Support It?\" Other moves include contacting other independent organizations that might be interested in the campaign, including \"People for Bernie,\" a group led\nby Occupy veterans.\n\nBut, she emphasized, \"We are running an UNCOORDINATED campaign. This means we are not communicating with the Bernie Sanders official campaign. If individual DSAers show up to a Bernie campaign event in a DSA T-shirt, that's OK, but not coordinating with the campaign in any way.\"\n\nIn particular, the organization will not, for the present, do any official fundraisers. In a May 24 update in response to questions from locals around the country, Svart emphasized \"No one should organize a fundraiser as DSA. You should not have DSA literature. You should not introduce yourself as a DSAer if you give remarks.You should not use a DSA list to invite people.\"\n\nFuture local membership meetings and salons will develop DSA's range of action in the Sanders campaign as more guidance appears.\n\n\n\n[*Postal Unions Set \"Grand Alliance\" Against Ongoing Efforts to Privatize USPS*](http://dsadc.org/postal-unions-set-grand-alliance-against-ongoing-efforts-to-privatize-usps/)\n\nMonday, June 1st, 2015\n\n***The Washington Socialis*t &lt;&gt; June 2015**\n\n*By Andy Feeney*\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service and its unionized workforce have been under attack for more than a decade by rightwing Republicans who apparently hope to shrink or eliminate its operations over time and transfer its functions to private industry. To this end, a Republican Congress in 2002 passed legislation ordering the USPS to prefund its pension fund liabilities some 75 years into the future, thus guaranteeing that the Postal Service, almost regardless of its revenue stream, will run large yearly budget deficits. Then, in the name of reducing the budget deficits, conservatives have called for the closing of rural post offices in many places, the shutting of regional mail-processing centers, the elimination of Saturday mail service and the transfer of postage stamp sales to private retailers, including Wal-Mart and Staples.\n\nThis year, under the leadership of the American Postal Workers Union (APWU), one of four different unions representing USPS employees, the embattled postal workers and their allies have started to fight back against the privatizers. Earlier this year, APWU president Mark Dimondstein announced the formation of a \"Grand Alliance\" of labor unions and other national organizations devoted to preserving the Postal Service and even potentially expanding its functions.\n\nAnd on May 14, APWU members and supporters from the Grand Alliance rallied in 130 locations across 45 states, DC and Puerto Rico in support of a new contract for the APWU that would slow the privatization drive and support the establishment of new USPS operations, notably through \"postal banking\" services that would give many Americans an alternative to payday loan companies and private check-cashing services.\n\nIn the Metro Washington, DC area on May 14, about 25-30 union members and a few allies gathered outside the Brentwood mail processing facility near the Brookland shopping center to support the APWU contract negotiating team. For approximately two hours, demonstrators chanted in favor of a new contract and \"union power\" in the general sense, at one point marching onto the shopping center's parking lot to demonstrate outside of Giant (which is unionized) and Home Depot (which is not)\\*. After a few minutes of chanting, we were told by an annoyed manager of Home Depot that we were allegedly on company property and needed to leave, which inspired some spirited argument by several feisty women in the APWU contingent. However, on the advice of the local union president, we did leave to return to the front of the Brentwood facility for remarks by union officials. We also distributed dozens if not hundreds of postcards to passing motorists and local shoppers addressed to Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan, expressing support for a strong Postal Service and for the APWU's contract demands. Most people after signing the postcards returned them to the union to convey to Postmaster General Brennan; a few took the cards with them to sign and home and mail in independently.\n\nHow effective the May 14 rallies and the postcard campaign will be in persuading USPS management to accept the union's demands remains to be seen. The APWU's national contract expired on May 20 with no agreement between the union and the Postal Service. On May 21 APWU president Dimondstein issued a press statement saying the contract talks have been extended as the negotiators seek to resolve differences over \"economic issues.\" For now, Dimondstein indicated, the old contract terms remain in effect; if the APWU cannot reach agreement with the Postal Service on a new contract, it will likely resort to mediation and/or arbitration in search of a better deal.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of this year's contract talks, however, the APWU's effort to build a Grand Alliance of supporters for a healthy Postal Service and good USPS jobs seems to be off to a promising start. In March, when the Alliance was first announced, it boasted some 65 member organizations; however, there now are 75 national organizations on the membership list. These include the AFL-CIO, other postal worker unions and a host of other national and international unions, as well as the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance, the Black Woman's Roundtable, the Coalition of Labor Union Women, the Campaign for America's Future, the Catholic Alliance for the Common Good, the Center for Media and Democracy, the Center for Rural Affairs, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Consumer Action, Democracy for America, the Gamaliel Network (a religious justice coalition), Greenpeace USA, the Jewish Labor Committee, the Ms. Foundation for Women, National Action Network, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, National Consumers League, the National Council of Churches, the National Organization for Women, National People's Action, People Demanding Action, People for the American Way, the Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc., Public Citizen, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the Sierra Club, United Students Against Sweatshops, and Vote Vets Action Fund, among other groups.\n\nThe support that Alliance members have expressed for a strong Postal Service going forward has had some influence on Postal Service management in the contract talks, Dimondstein indicated in his May 21 statement, and the postcards to Postmaster General Brennan are helpful. APWU members and supporters should keep collecting signatures and sending them in to the USPS as talks continue.\n\nFor more information contact the union website at http://www.apwu.org/.

Soon you see a young woman getting a glimpse of the future but finding that future in jeopardy. The film is about saving the future.\n\n**Tomorrowland** is inspired by Disney's historical views of the future as well as our current political intransigence on issues like climate change. The film veers into conspiracy as well as the reluctance of authorities to accept new ideas. The film demonstrates leadership by women and girls and also shows more diversity than any film that I can remember. Although the plot is convoluted and has fun with animation, a strong point is that if you want a different future than what we are staggering toward, you need to get organizing for that future. The film should be great fun for families with children and a topic for conversation.\n\nThe film's weakness is that it focuses on individuals and not the social movements that transform history. The film's success of promoting organizing is undercut by wanting to organize only the elite, the best and brightest.

New to the SC is Jonathan Phipps, a national member and activist living in suburban Baltimore who said he will spend considerable time getting a covalent Baltimore-area local under way with support from both national DSA and the Metro-DC local.\n\nAt the same membership meeting, the members agreed to form several committees/working groups. A revival of a feminist working group on women's issues will be led by Goldstrom, Byerly and Ross Templeton. Another. a new initiative, is on gentrification – the severe effects on neighborhoods and on the affordability of housing that come from rampant, uncontrolled real estate speculation. Communities are ravaged, deformed and displaced by rent increases as landlords upgrade to attract new, affluent and younger tenants, most of whom have little connection to the communities they are joining. The resource-starved DC government has embraced the tax advantages of letting developers have their way in nearly every ward (including not-so-benign neglect of the city's poorest areas, like Ward 8). The results for neighborhoods have been catastrophic. A socialist perspective on gentrification is close to the surface; it is inherent in communities' grasp of the real authors of their misery. Andy Feeney will coordinate the development of the working group on gentrification and housing issues.\n\n**In This Issue** **Money!** It's a hit... etc. Bill Mosley signals that the annual round of local dues solicitation is about to head out for mailboxes and inboxes.

Only a few lone voices objected on behalf of ratepayers and the environment.\n\nMerger approval would make Exelon the largest utility not only in Maryland but in the US, as [*a coalition of 20 progressive and environmental groups in Maryland argued in late 2014*](http://chesapeakeclimate.org/press-releases/20-maryland-groups-oppose-the-exelon-pepco-merger/) when presenting a united objection to the merger. \"The proposed merger would harm consumers and the environment and prevent Maryland from realizing a clean, affordable, and reliable 21st-century electric grid,\" the coalition contended.\n\nInstead, \"this merger would lock over 80% of Marylanders into a 20<sup>th</sup>-century grid controlled by a single company based in Chicago\" and one with a track record of actively opposing renewable energy policy, the coalition's statement continued.\n\nLittle concern about environmental effects or the vulnerability of ratepayers under the new regime was heard from the parade of well-dressed charitable organization representatives who testified before the PSC at the hearing at Prince George's Community College.\n\nInstead, the merger supporters from United Way, the Prince George's Business Roundtable, the Arbor Day Foundation, one I.B.E.W. local and the Anacostia Watershed Society lauded the companies for their past contributions and purported commitment to minority hiring and subcontracting – expressing hope that crumbs would continue to fall from the corporate table.\n\nGenerally progressive organizations like the Prince George's NAACP fell into line, president Bob Ross expressing support for the merger and gratitude for Pepco's past financial contributions with no reference to the potential exposure of ratepayers. David Harrington, once a fairly progressive member of the Maryland Senate, endorsed the merger speaking as executive director of the county Chamber of Commerce, and citing Exelon's \"unwavering track record of environmental stewardship.\"\n\nSome local residents, less well-turned-out citizens appeared in small numbers to oppose the merger on the grounds that Exelon's recent record as corporate overlord of Baltimore Gas & Electric and its dependence on nuclear for over half its overall generating capacity threatened both ratepayers and the environment.\n\nThe most comprehensive opposition came from a self-identified resident and ratepayer from Upper Marlboro whose \"household has been a residential solar generator for over three years.\" As did the earlier anti-merger coalition, he argued that distributed generation involving renewable sources would improve Maryland's overall power picture. \"This case is about the shape of our grid and who gets to make money off of it. Exelon has all the wrong incentives here,\" he said. The giant corporation, facing increasing expense from its aging nuclear power plants, \"is looking for a cash cow... to shift its financial risk onto ratepayers.\" He also cited the company's record of opposing renewable energy. Pepco, by comparison, will represent \"ratepayers, not just shareholders,\" in the three-state regional power grid, he said.\n\nBut the well-manicured turnout from the nonprofit and charitable community was numerically overwhelming. Maryland, as one of 15 states with deregulated utilities, has comparatively little public authority over the corporate providers of power in the state. Maryland and DC are in the 5-state \"PJM\" regional grid, where Exelon has huge sway already. The [*Department of Energy's statistics show*](http://www.publicpower.org/files/PDFs/RKW_Final_-_2013_update.pdf) that states (mostly Atlantic Coast states) with deregulated (corporate) power providers rather than public power authorities have higher electrical rates. [*One quite red state has a statewide public power utility – Nebraska.*](http://community-wealth.org/content/nebraska-s-community-owned-electricity-system) A national environmentalist perspective on this Exelon proposal is at [*http://grist.org/climate-energy/the-exelon-pepco-merger-big-nuke-heavy-utility-looking-for-new-ratepayers-to-fleece/*](http://grist.org/climate-energy/the-exelon-pepco-merger-big-nuke-heavy-utility-looking-for-new-ratepayers-to-fleece/)\n\nThe PSC decision likely remains some time away, but the Maryland public hearings on the case have concluded. Comments from the public in addition to those made at the series of public hearings may be made by writing David J. Collins, Executive Secretary, Maryland Public Service Commission, 6 Saint Paul Street, Baltimore, MD 21202-6806. No comments are accepted at the PSC website. \"Evidentiary hearings\" on the merger, which is case no. 9361, are scheduled before the full PSC during the last week of January and [*every day from Monday, Feb. 2 to Friday, Feb. 6.*](http://webapp.psc.state.md.us/Intranet/maillog/hearing_new.cfm)","order":0},{"title":"Chronicling the wreckage of bipartisan neoliberalism","date":"2015-02-01","issue":"February 2015","author":"David Duhalde","body":"**Review**: *Losing Our Way: An Intimate Portrait of a Troubled America* by Bob Herbert (Random House, 2014)\n\n*By David Duhalde*\n\nThe Great Recession's poverty is just as hidden from public view among the formerly rich as it is among the poor and working classes. Bob Herbert, the retired *New York Times* columnist, chronicles the façade of economic security in his latest book, *Losing our Way*.\n\nWealthy Hunterdon County in western New Jersey, known primarily for its horse farms and scenic rolling hillsides, had experienced a dramatic increase in families seeking federal food assistance during the recession and its aftermath. The director of a social service agency that found itself offering assistance to an entirely new constituency told *Bloomberg News* \"Sometimes people will come in a Mercedes. Sometimes they come in \\[wearing\\] Ralph Lauren. But you never know. That may be all they have.\" (page 41)\n\nThese stories make Herbert's work as upsetting as it is uplifting. The self-proclaimed \"intimate portrait of a troubled America\" places summaries of academic work side-by-side with personal stories, including by my fiancé, about the four themes. The \"way\" was our willingness to spend heavily on public works, public education, and other social goods even if it means higher taxes and a long-term return on investment.Herbert walks the reader through 12 chapters about the themes of employment, war, education, and infrastructure.\n\nHe juxtaposes the seemingly separate, but interconnected, policies that our elected leaders enacted with deadly consequences. Herbert recalls the Bush administration's unprecedented call for simultaneous tax cuts*and*war. Foreign conflict was paid for with our money that was needed at home. The president and politicians of both partiessent our young people to fight Iraqis and Afghanis, but were unwilling to battle our crumbling infrastructure.\n\nThrough profiles of wounded soldiers and workers, Herbert chronicles death, injury, and recovery on the international and domestic front. Soldiers continue to be killed and maimed long after many high-level government officials had concluded the wars had limited benefit. Congress and the president funnel billions into these conflicts while ignoring our outdated public works. Instead of terrorism, US residents are killed by broken levees or collapsing bridges, and are poisoned by compromised water systems.\n\nHerbert also unmasks the corporate agenda behind much of \"education reform.\" He separates the proponents of education reform: the well-intentioned Bill Gates, the malicious Michelle Rhee, and the money-hungry Rupert Murdoch. Gates' oversized wallet propelled his social experiment of small schools within one building into existence. The scheme, which was abandoned with little fanfare, is unable to build community or significantly increase graduation rates, while successfully pushing the most troubled students into other, failing, schools.\n\nRhee's toxic mix of self-righteousness and an affinity for termination (she gleefully invites a news crew to watch her fire an educator) led to the downfalls of both her and the DC mayor she served. Murdoch and scores of other charter advocates cannot hide their interests in the profits from the privatization of public education. They work night and day to undermine the social support of school as a public good.\n\nThe chapters on the troubled job market cover both the young and old, and were deeply personal, especially to me. Herbert interviewed one of my own loved ones. He tells her story of frustration at the inability to break into a profession that she not only went to school for, but was promised would have jobs in abundance. Instead, she found herself both living in cramped space at home and experiencing glass ceilings at work. For her, many others, and myself things have slowly improved as the economic recovery moves along. But many young adults remember when the question was what job you would have after college, not if you'd be working.\n\nHerbert knows hiding poverty and economic insecurity are not new, and neither are the solutions to ending them. He cites Michael Harrington's 1962 classic, *The Other America,* which shocked many comfortable people at the time with the fact that poverty was not disappearing for millions of their fellow citizens. Thirty years after the first publication, Irving Howe asked: How can you allow such a scandal to fester in this country? Herbert writes \"that question is no less relevant and the scandalous extent of poverty in America no less shameful.\" To combat inequality and injustice, Herbert advocates a heavily used tool of the 1960's: disruptive politics.\n\nBob Herbert's book is an unequivocal reminder that well-organized and disruptive protest is a proven method of social change. Our country's ideological extremes motivate much of the support for disruptive politics in the Obama era, such as the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, and today's Black Lives Matter movement. It is a refreshing call for collective action in a time when many liberals would rather embrace another messianic presidential run (substituting Elizabeth Warren for Barack Obama – because the first time worked so well) than question their own dismal track record.\n\nIn the epilogue, Herbert calls for new leadership — not of a president or a new party, but from grassroots leaders. As for how those people can make lasting change, Herbert opines:\n\nThe short answer is direct action. The legendary organizer Saul Alinsky taught that there were two main sources of power: money and people. As virtually all of the money is currently on the side of the entrenched power, the only viable option for ordinary Americans is the creative use of their own energy, intelligence, and superior numbers. Democracy might have taken a beating in the United States, but it is not dead. A tremendous amount of power still resides with the people. And history has shown again and again that direct action, when properly organized and sustained, can be remarkably effective. The abolitionists, civil rights activists, labor organizers, and feminists all understood that democracy was not meant to be a sporting event, a pastime for interested onlookers. Taking responsibility for one's individual circumstance*and*the well-being of the country has always required much more than merely casting a ballot...Without that kind of increased citizen involvement no real change for the better can be expected.\n\nAfter three decades of bipartisan neoliberalism, it is hard to disagree.\n\n*David Duhalde was the YDS national organizer from 2006 to 2008 and currently researches for a campaign finance reform group in Washington, D.C. He is a member of DSA's National Political Committee.*","order":1},{"title":"Coalition Forms to Address Gentrification Crisis in DC","date":"2015-02-01","issue":"February 2015","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"Ever-rising rents and real estate values, growing inequality, the actions of private developers, lax laws and regulations, and a sometimes corrupt collaboration between politicians and developers have combined to create a crisis of gentrification in the District of Columbia over the years. In a January panel discussion before a packed audience at the Busboys and Poets at 14<sup>th</sup> and V Street N.W. in the District, several local anti-gentrification activists discussed a new campaign to bring the crisis under control.\n\nThe campaign, the People's Platform, is being led by ONE DC, an organization of roughly 400 members based in the rapidly gentrifying Shaw neighborhood. ONE DC describes itself as dedicated to many of the principles that inspired the late Ella Baker and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s, including participatory democracy; involving grassroots people in the decisions that affect their lives; minimizing hierarchy and professionalism in organizations working for social change; and engaging in direct action to resolve social problems.\n\nIts mission, according to ONE DC literature, \"is to exercise political strength to create and preserve racial and economic equity in Shaw and the District,\" and in doing so to \"create a community in DC that is equitable for all.\" Its organizing campaigns center on popular education, community organizing, and alternative economic development projects, and the People's Platform campaign against gentrification incorporates several of these ideas.\n\nJoining with ONE DC in the People's Platform campaign are D.C. Jobs with Justice (DC-JwJ), the local Restaurant Opportunities Center (ROC DC); Our DC, an organization working for better jobs and wages for low-income District residents; and Empower DC, an organizing group working to \"enhance, improve and promote the self-advocacy of low and moderate income DC residents in order to bring about sustained improvements in their quality of life.\"\n\nThe objectives and demands of the People's Platform campaign are many and varied. One is to raise the minimum wage in the District to $15 an hour, a goal that will be the focus of Metro DC DSA's main organizing campaign this year. However, other campaign goals are focused almost entirely on fighting gentrification, among other means by making a number of changes in D.C. law and regulations affecting rent subsidies, the availability of public housing, and financial assistance for tenants who wish to take advantage of the District's existing TOPA law allowing residents to purchase units in their own buildings when building ownership changes.\n\nAnother key focus of the People's Platform is ending the District's current practice of auctioning off abandoned vacant lands and empty buildings to private developers for redevelopment, which generally occurs in a fashion that eliminates housing stock for low-income residents, often people of color, with children and developing new units aimed at occupancy by higher-income, younger professional people, often white, who can afford significantly higher rents while requiring fewer services. In the place of such practices, the People's Platform calls for several measures to keep abandoned lands and buildings in public ownership and make them available for cooperative housing developments to be owned by low-income residents themselves.\n\nAccording to Bob Schlehuber, an individual member of the People's Platform coalition who emceed the panel discussion at Busboys and Poets, another focus of the campaign is on eliminating or reforming the often corrupt financial arrangements that currently enmesh DC politicians with real estate developers hoping to profit from gentrification.\n\nFor more information about ONE DC, please click here: [*http://www.onedconline.org/*](http://www.onedconline.org/).

Close readers of that classic come to realize that, while members of the two parties ostensibly represent the local power structure, all important planning boards, letting local contracts, ownership of property and the means of production inhere in an unelected power. In the 1978 classic newspaper parody, the local power structure was an organized crime family, but hey, that was the era of *The Godfather*. Socialists understand that capitalism, which is organized crime, was the ruling power in Dacron, Ohio, \"Motor Home Capital of the World,\" behind the façade of two-party government.\n\nIts parallels emerge every time the Maryland General Assembly, with its overwhelming Democratic majority, makes nice with the new Republican governor even as Gov. Larry Hogan rolls back whatever limited progress was made during the O'Malley administration. An avuncular front man, Hogan has reinstated much of the Republican agency infrastructure – and people – that made the previous (Bob Ehrlich) Republican administration such a disaster.\n\n**The Hogan budget** reflects a bipartisan unwillingness to raise revenues consonant with a wealthy state... instead a \"structural deficit\" is used as an excuse to cut vital services to keep the rapacious business community quiet. They get more every time they ask. [*http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-budget-briefing-20150126-story.html\\#page=1*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-budget-briefing-20150126-story.html#page=1)\n\n**A much-challenged law** requiring major counties to reduce the pollutants they send to the Chesapeake Bay has survived so far, despite being ridiculed as a \"rain tax\" by Republicans. Under the Hogan regime, the counties that elected him are feeling free about [*rolling back their stormwater management fees.*](http://eedition2.baltimoresun.com/Olive/ODE/BaltimoreSun2/) Individual homeowners were paying pretty low fees under the requirement, but the fees were hitting hard on developers with large tracts and big, heavily polluting parking lots (and quite a few mega-churches, especially in Prince George's County, where huge tracts of church land are otherwise tax-exempt). The Sun article doesn't background the situation sufficiently – if the federal EPA does not find the Bay pollution mitigated, the state and its jurisdictions face big fines. The same applies to Hogan's casual rollback of an O'Malley plan to regulate chicken manure disposal on the Eastern Shore, where it is another major polluter. The big industrial chicken farmers knew that their boo-hoos would register on a Republican administration, and now they've got one. [*There's a push-back*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bal-legislation-coming-on-farm-pollution-20150128-story.html), though, from House leadership.\n\n**Some further progressive goals** hoped-for in this session look like a much heavier lift when facing the GOP regime.

Now, there is a chance that Pepco's operations will be absorbed by an enormous, multi-state utility company headquartered in Chicago, which might be just as bad at ensuring reliable service asPepco and probably won't be as responsive to DC-area customers and elected officials.\n\nThat's one reason why the Office of People's Counsel (the government unit in the District charged with representing the interests of utility consumers), and several groups and individual voices representing local ratepayers and green energy advocates are opposing the proposed merger ofPepco and its holding company Pepco Holdings, Inc, with the Exelon Corporation and its associated business entities.\n\nWhat some of the merger opponents are saying, essentially, is that an Exelon takeover ofPepco would help to reverse the beneficial impacts of a basically \"capitalist\" reform in utility operation and regulation that has gone into effect in PEPCO's service area and much of the nation over the past few decades. The capitalist reform in question was the legal, regulatory and economic separation of electric energy generation from electric energy distribution.\n\nSmart business economists have long recognized that the distribution of electricity to a wide customer base, because of the centralized network of transmission wires needed, is a \"natural monopoly,\" a service that only a single corporate entity can carry out efficiently over a big customer base. The generation of electricity from coal, nuclear power, oil, natural gas, wind power or solar cells, however, is a potentially competitive business. To provide individual customers with lower prices, and also to allow cleaner and greener energy sources like solar energy and wind power to compete in the electricity market with big coal-fired and nuclear-based generating plants, it makes a kind of economic sense to allow electric power providers to compete for business, but to continue having the juice delivered to ratepayers through a regulated monopoly distribution company.\n\nMany years ago, the District and the state of Maryland therefore largely deregulated electricity generation across Pepco's present service area, while keepingPepco itself as a distribution company to get power to its traditional customers. But the proposed merger of PEPCO with Exelon, the critics are saying, would potentially negate the \"deregulation\" that has occurred.\n\nWhy? As Alex Doukas of the climate activist group DC Divest testified in December before the D.C. Public Service Commission, Exelon as a company is a \"generating giant,\" and \"fundamentally a generator of electricity\" – not, like present-day Pepco, a company focused on distribution. In fact, Exelon owns some 35,000 megawatts of power generating capacity scattered across a number of states, and some of its power plants produce electricity at \"above market rates,\" meaning it has an incentive – if it can do so – to force its customers to buy power from it at higher prices than they could receive from other electricity providers.\n\nIf Exelon, the \"generating giant,\" gains control overPepco as a regulated monopoly provider of electricity distribution, the merged entity will have an enhanced opportunity to force D.C. consumers to eat its higher generating costs, Doukas and other critics of the merger argue.\n\n\"In many ways, the interests of a \\[generating\\] company like Exelon ... and the interests of electricity consumers are inherently in conflict,\" Doukas further testified in December. \"Consumer savings, including through energy efficiency, represent a cost to generators. History has shown that there is a grave risk to progress on energy efficiency if it's left to companies who, like Exelon, have dominant interests in electricity generation.\"\n\nIn oral testimony also submitted to the District's Public Service Commission (PSC) in December, local environmental advocate and researcher Marchant Wentworth pointed out that nuclear energy has recently provided some 57 percent of Exelon's power generating capacity, according to the company's own 2013 10-K filing.\n\n\"Nuclear power plants are vulnerable to increased costs\" due to several different factors, Wentworth added. In the wake of the recent Fukishima nuclear reactor disaster in Japan, they face additional costs related to safety improvements needed to address the risks of such disasters. They also face added costs related to the storage of nuclear waste as well as additional costs \"due to needed upgrades in \\[their\\] use of cooling water\" under EPA Rule 316(B). Still another cost that older nuclear reactors face – and many of Exelon's reactors are aging – consist of the projected costs of \"decommissioning\" old reactors at the ends of their useful lives and disposing safely of some of their components that are radioactive.\n\nFinancial losses to Exelon \"derived from sources that would not be regulated by this Commission,\" Wentworth concluded, \"could force Exelon to attempt to recover money from District ratepayers in order to keep its stock price up and satisfy its shareholders.\"\n\nCiting these and other factors, the D.C. Office of the People's Counsel on Nov. 3 called on the PSC to reject the proposed $6.8 billion merger proposal. People's Counsel Sandra Mattavous-Frye filed testimony with the PSC acknowledging thatPepco and Exelon have proposed a $14-million \"Customer Investment Fund\" to shield local ratepayers from negative economic impacts in the short run. However, the OPC testimony added that the proposed fund is \"small compared to the substantial risks created by the merger,\" and that its benefits would be negated by risks \"associated with the three 'R's: Reliability, Rates and Renewables – all major areas where this application falls short.\"\n\nWarning of the likelihood of \"serial rate cases\" to raise prices once the proposed deal is completed, Ms. Mattavous-Frye warned: \"If the merger is approved, consumers are likely to see higher rate increases than if the merger were not approved.\" Her prepared testimony continued: \"because Exelon has a riskier financial profit than Pepco, consumers will pay even higher rate increase than \\[they\\] would under Pepco.\"\n\nPEPCO's problems with reliability and recovery from power outages might have made it unpopular locally, but according to the OPC's testimony, \"Exelon will deliver a lower level of reliability than Pepco would provide,\" partly because its merger proposal is \"devoid of any best practices to address vegetation management and feeder maintenance – two areas critical for improving reliability.\"\n\nThe OPC also has expressed concern about the economies of scale normally associated with corporate mergers leading to the loss of DC-area jobs now provided by Pepco, and has warned that the merger will \"likely have a detrimental impact on ... wholesale electricity markets\" once Exelon supplants Pepco Holdings, Inc. (PHI) in the stakeholder negations of the regional PJM pool of linked electricity providers. PHI has \"traditionally\" advocated for customer interests in the PJM stakeholder process, but \"Exelon's generation-driven priorities ... would conflict with and may nullify PHI's historic emphasis on cost implications and reliability for consumers.\"\n\nFor climate activists and renewable energy activists commenting on the merger proposal, a major factor is Exelon's record to opposing federal tax subsidies for wind energy generation, on the one hand, and its opposition to \"distributed\" electricity generation, on the other.\n\nBack in the late 1980s, the Carter administration pushed through federal regulatory reforms that encouraged states to allow individuals and small businesses that generate their own power from small solar energy, wind power and other renewable sources to sell back some of the electricity they produce to the utility distribution grid. The policy of \"reverse metering\" or \"net metering,\" so called, essentially enables a small producer of solar-generated electricity to generate more than enough power for its own needs during a sunny day, for example, and to sell that extra power back to the local electricity distribution utility. Then during the night, when solar cells obviously are not providing any electricity, the owner of the solar cells can buy electricity from the grid, just like anyone else.\n\nSuch reverse metering, by allowing multiple owners of small renewable energy producing units to contribute to the grid collectively, has the potential to make solar and wind energy production more affordable and to reduce the long-term need for more coal and nuclear plants.Pepco as a distribution-only utility currently supports such \"distributed energy\" production.\n\nHowever, merger critics say, Exelon as a large power generator has every economic reason to oppose distributed power generation, and in recent years it has done so in several states, in some cases working in alliance with ALEC – the rightwing American Legislative Exchange Council – to argue against small solar and wind power producers being able to sell to the grid. The company also has lobbied in Congress against federal tax credits for wind energy production.\n\nAlthough Exelon in the past \"has supported clean air laws and ... energy efficiency,\" the OPC said in its testimony, \"these notable efforts are substantially outweighed\" by the corporation's \"vocal\" opposition to wind power and distributed generation.\n\nAccordingly, a number of individuals and groups supporting small-scale renewable energy production are opposing the merger.\n\nDespite the reasoning of merger foes, however, the Dec. 17 PSC hearing on the proposal, which I attended as an individual, featured striking turnout of individuals representing local utility contractors and a host of DC-area charitable organizations all firmly supporting Exelon's bid to take over Pepco.\n\nIn statement after statement, individuals testified thatPepco has historically been very generous in contributing to local black-owned businesses and social service organizations, and they were virtually unanimous in predicting that Exelon would be even better thanPepco has been. The merger will produce greater service reliability, an increase in local utility-related jobs, and economies of scale that generate lower electricity prices for consumers, many of them insisted.\n\nDave Freeman, a former chairman of the board of the giant Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and a former operating manager of several other large, publicly owned utilities, including the New York Power Authority and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), began his testimony to the PSC by saying that at TVA he, too, had ensured that his public utility contributed generously to local businesses and charitable groups.\n\nContributing to local charities was a well-known way of buying local political support with utility money, Freeman suggested. He went on to praise thePepco and Exelon public affairs departments for likely preparing the testimony of many individuals supporting the merger at the hearing.\n\nThe District PSC's hearings to solicit public testimony on the merger have now concluded, but interested individuals can still submit written testimony on the proposal until March 26, 2015. Written statements may be submitted by mail or in person to Brinda Westbrook-Sedgwick, Commission Secretary, Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia, 1333 H Street, N.W., Suite 200, West Tower, Washington DC 2005, or they can be emailed to [*PSC-CommissionSecretary@dc.gov*](mailto:PSC-CommissionSecretary@dc.gov), or submitted through the Commission's eDocket system at [*http://www.depsc.org/edocket.asp*](http://www.depsc.org/edocket.asp).\n\nFor DSAers interested in hearing more from former TVA chairman Dave Freeman, he is scheduled to speak on the history and future of public power in the United States at our next general membership meeting. It will occur Sunday, Feb. 15 at 2 p.m. at the Watha P.

On Jan. 7, hundreds of anti-TPP activists participated in a national conference call featuring Naomi Klein, author of *The Shock Doctrine* and *This Changes Everything*, on the subject of how existing trade treaties such as NAFTA undercut the ability of elected governments at the state, provincial and national levels to promote green energy policies and combat climate change.\n\nThe establishment of the TPP would make matters worse, Klein said: the proposed treaty is essentially a \"corporate insurance policy against democracy\" that would enable affected corporations to challenge if not overturn citizen efforts to restrain carbon emissions, provide incentives for local renewable energy production and block the construction of pipelines and ports to facilitate exports of fossil fuels. In reaction to the climate change threat, Klein said, a global entity she calls \"Blockadia\" has come into existence that seeks to stop fossil fuel exports on the ground, and \"as Blockadia spreads, there are going to be more and more desperate efforts by the fossil fuel companies to use trade policies to win battles in trade tribunals that they have lost in public opinion.\"\n\nParticipating in the conference call with Klein were regional organizers for MoveOn.org, Alyssa Simons of Public Citizens Global Trade Watch, Andrea Miller of People Demanding Action (PDA), and AFL-CIO trade specialist Celeste Drake, along with Ilana Solomon, head of the Responsible Trade Program for the Sierra Club.\n\nSpeaking for the Sierra Club, Solomon labeled the climate change challenge \"the major environmental crisis of our times\" and stated that combating it \"is going to mean making several major changes to our economy\" that would be far more difficult to achieve under the TPP as well as a companion proposal, the Trans Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Solomon added: \"The TPP would actually grant new powers to the coal, oil and natural gas industries,\" including by mandating that the U.S. Department of Energy automatically approve exports of natural gas. The proposed pact also would \"fundamentally prohibit national governments from incentivizing local energy production.\"\n\nThe corporations, the Obama administration and pro-corporate Republicans and Democrats are stepping up their efforts to get \"fast track\" authority for Obama to negotiate the treaty passed by Congress within the very near future, PDA's Andrea Miller told conference call participants. To fight against that, PDA and other organizations have organized recurring \"twitter storms\" to bombard the Twitter accounts of House members with anti-TPP messages. PDA's web site also has devised form letters that anti-TPP activists can send to local newspapers to oppose the proposed treaty, and possible variations of these letters include language suitable \"for contacting newspapers in your area if they are a little right-wing.\"\n\nOrganizers of the anti-TPP coalition, who have been holding periodic conference calls on this issue for almost two years now, also are thinking about scheduling actions in the home offices of individual members of Congress during the President's Day recess in February, participants in the conference call said.\n\nCeleste Drake of the AFL-CIO said people looking for fact sheets to use in making anti-TPP arguments to members of Congress may be able to find fact sheets on TPP, TTIP and the \"fast track\" issue through the AFL-CIO at the web site [*AFLCIO.org/issues/trade*](http://www.aflcio.org/Issues/Trade).

Activists from Maryland's suburbs and the District of Columbia described the prospects and hazards of the local political landscape at Metro DC DSA's Jan. 15 Salon.\n\nLucy Duff and Lisa Stand of Prince George's County, Wally Malakoff of Montgomery County, and Eugene Puryear, a recent at-large candidate in the DC Council election, analyzed their respective locales after the election of Muriel Bowser as DC Mayor and the upset win of Republican Larry Hogan in the Maryland gubernatorial race. Both are expected to continue the business- and developer-friendly policies common to both parties, but the control of Maryland's governor over the budget process may hamper efforts to get progressive policies and measures rolled into the next round of legislative action.\n\nDuff works in the Prince George's Peace and Justice Coalition, a largely white and aging north-county group centered in Greenbelt. PGP&J also joins with an offshoot of Montgomery Peace Action called Fund Our Communities, which agitates for a reduced dependency in Maryland on military spending and employment and for reductions in the Pentagon budget in favor of human needs spending. PGP&J also is a key agent in the \"Reel and Meal,\" a Greenbelt-based monthly progressive-themed film shown at the community-supported New Deal Café. The group operates in informal coalition with numerous other groups, including often with the Greenbelt Climate Action Network, which is lobbying at the local and state level on environment and sustainability issues and developing a local sustainability-resilience network. Opportunities include working with groups that have paid staff such as Progressive Maryland, and groups focusing on immediate trends such as Get Money out of Maryland (GMOM) and Move to Amend, both of which fight the effects of the Citizens United decision and corporate influence on campaign finance.\n\nLisa Stand, of Progressive Cheverly, described the group's lobbying efforts within the Prince George's County town of that name as well as at the county and state levels. Acknowledging that the environment for progressive action is \"weak\" and in a \"holding pattern\" as the new governor jockeys for influence with the veto-proof Democratic majority in both houses of the General Assembly, Stand said the strength of her group is in its consistent lobbying presence over the years in coalition with other progressive groups such as Fund Our Communities and environmental activist organizations. Progressive Cheverly makes political endorsements judiciously, she added, suggesting it was important to weigh the group's effectiveness in each race and \"balance what \\[influence\\] you have against what you need.\n\nFor this year, Stand offered her own assessment that P\\\\progressives' best issue in Maryland is tax fairness, she argued. A future goal for DC and Maryland activists is to find policy themes that echo with Northern Virginia progressives, such as the minimum wage campaigns that have already had success in Maryland and DC.\n\nWhere Duff and Stand focused on Prince George's County, Wally Malakoff's group, Progressive Neighbors, is concentrated in the Takoma Park and Silver Spring areas of Montgomery County, where it originated in an electoral campaign – to elect a new state senator, Jamie Raskin. Progressive Neighbors expanded its scope into a Progressive Working Group that backed progressive state legislation. The group's decline after several vigorous years, Malakoff said, came because most members of the larger coalition were single-issue organizations – \"we haven't solved that problem.\" \"Maryland is a place where you can get some things done\" in a progressive vein, he said, but there's a ceiling on many economic issues which \"the ruling class is solidly against.\" As an example he cited the 2014 legislative session's major rollback on estate taxes, a knuckling under to business and wealthy interests that was hardly touched on by local media. The need for a stronger presence in Annapolis has led Progressive Neighbors to undertake fundraising to support a lobbyist during the session.\n\nPuryear shifted the conversation to the District, where, he said, a distinct working-class political movement is still lacking and some younger, essentially progressive residents have lost interest and faith in the political system. Still, he argued, there is a growing progressive movement – not just sentiment – among the District's youth, and it could be sharpened if activists are \"a little more bold in who we say we are\" and \"get a deeper hearing on socialist and anticapitalist issues.\"\n\nHe cited his own recent at-large Council campaign on the Statehood/Green ballot line as an example, saying there was \"an acknowledged level of serious intent\" in the campaign recognized by the political culture and even the press, and \"no red-baiting\" about his membership in a socialist organization[*. The Party of Socialism and Liberation.*](http://www.liberationnews.org/home-page/about/) Despite the victories of Democratic candidates or those backed by Democratic forces (in the case of the independent at-large race, \"more young activists are seeing politics as relevant\" though (or perhaps because) \"young people have lost a sense of agency.\" The task is to rebuild a network among young workers, and progressives need to realize the fundraising prowess it will take to staff such undertakings, Puryear said.\n\nComment from the thirty-plus attendees ranged from suggestions that the political process had to give way to revolutionary organizing, to arguments that young people in the District and generally were more apathetic about politics than Puryear had portrayed. Discussions of how to make progressive politics and policies more appealing to young people – a frequent concern of the somewhat graying DSA local – focused on credibility and identification of progressive organizations. \"There has to be some non-Democratic Party force,\" Puryear declared.\n\nResponding to the discussion, Duff stressed long-term relationship-building and Stand a \"development of social space\" for progressive activism – \"part of it is cultural,\" she added. Malakoff said progressives had to improve their voter education through personal contact, noting that unlike the members of the Progressive Working Group coalition, \"DSA is not a single-issue group.\" Puryear said one discouraging lesson from his campaign was that \"knowing the most about the issue\" had no effect on the electability of a candidate.

People Demanding Action, however, cannot endorse candidates, although it can lobby on anything, and it is primarily focused on national politics. \"We'll work with you on local dog-catcher races if that's what's important to your neighborhood,\" she said.\n\nCommenting on the name of the new organization, Miller added, \"People Demanding Action has a nice Tea Party ring,\" and she said members are already finding certain areas of common ground with some Republicans.\n\nFor example, she said, in PDAmerica's work to block the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), \"our primary ally on the right was Michelle Bachman,\" because of Bachman's valid concern that the TPP would take away U.S. national sovereignty over issues affecting global corporations.\n\nPDAction is active in the coalition effort by labor activists, environmental groups, local community organizations and other concerned Americans to block the TPP, Miller indicated. Other currently important campaigns include pushing for three additional states to approve of the Equal Rights Amendment so as to get the ERA passed, to address the \"number one issue for women: economic inequality.\"\n\nPDAction has another campaign to pressure all nonprofit organizations with headquarters in Washington DC to press Congress for statehood for the District, Miller said – \"Full statehood with two senators and an elected representative.\" However, the organization plans to put much of its energy into facilitating and supporting grassroots organizing at the state and local level: \"We're going to be looking for as many community partners as we can find.\"\n\nPDA literature that Miller distributed with her presentation indicates that the group's mission is to \"bring together activists, organizers, faith leaders, social justice leaders and legislators to advance the core solutions of promoting household stability through economic justice, climate justice and social justice, while protecting the integrity of democratic elections and voting rights.\"\n\nPDA describes its strategy for accomplishing these aims as working to build a \"state-by-state network of activists\" who will work for reform \"through education, legislation, mobilization and non-violent direct action,\" so as to facilitate the building of a \"populist movement for justice.\"\n\nTo build supporters, Miller said, PDA has recruited a board that includes Rev. Rodney Sadler, chief organizer of the \"Moral Monday\" movement in South Carolina; Ben Ptashnik of the American Sustainable Business Council, a solar engineer and former Vermont state senator who recently has been active in fighting mass water shutoffs in Detroit; Dr. Gabriela Lemus, president and executive director of Progressive Congress, a 501(c) (3) organization associated with the Congressional Progressive Caucus; Joel Segal, former staffer for Rep. John Conyers who played a key role in writing Conyers' \"jobs for all\" bill; Alex Lofton, of Social Security Works; and as honorary PDA chair, Harriet Fulbright, the widow of the late Sen. J. William Fulbright, early critic of the Vietnam War and creator of the Fulbright Scholarships.\n\nIn addition to fighting the TPP and DC statehood and working for the final adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment, Miller said, the organization also is increasingly involved in trying to fight against bad court decisions at the state and local level that in recent years have helped conservatives to silence, and often to jail, local whistleblowers and progressive politicians working for change. Still additional campaigns listed on the PDA web site include working for zero carbon dioxide emissions in the US, fighting water shutoffs in Detroit, ending the mass incarceration of black men, and fighting against cuts in funding for educational and other social programs.\n\nLooking forward to the challenge of the coming year, in which activists face a Republican-dominated Congress with no apparent tolerance for progressive priorities, Miller said the left needs to imitate what the Tea Party did in the wake of the crushing Republican defeat in 2008. When we don't have representation in Congress, she said, leftists need to be \"kicking up shit\" and raising a furor through the media, a strategy that mostly worked for the numerically outnumbered Tea Party and that can work for progressives, too.\n\nFor more information on People Demanding Action, please check out the organization's web site at [*http://www.peopledemandingaction.org*](http://www.peopledemandingaction.org).","order":8},{"title":"To Stop Police Brutality, Change the System","date":"2015-02-01","issue":"February 2015","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"The mainstream media's coverage of recent incidents of police brutality would lead readers to think there's simple solution to the problem. Suggestions for quick fixes abound, such as requiring police to wear video cameras, de-militarizing police forces and adopting more gentle policing methods. But even in the progressive media, discussion of the underlying problem – centuries of exploitation and oppression that have alienated poor and minority communities from society – isn't as common as one might think.\n\nEven the nicest, most transparent policing won't compensate for the fact that for millions of Americans, the police are the most visible arm of a government that seeks to control and confine them, not to help or protect. One of the most perceptive articles written in the wake of the Ferguson, New York and Cleveland incidents was an analysis by [*Sam Mitrani in LaborOnline*](http://lawcha.org/wordpress/2014/12/29/stop-kidding-police-created-control-working-class-poor-people/), the newsletter of the Labor and Working-Class History Association. Mitrani points out that police forces in the United States were created largely to repress dissent and keep minorities in their places, with general public-safety duties being an afterthought. What constituted a crime was often defined as any attempt by the poor and working class to better their lot (hence the long-time criminalization of unions) and perceived threats by African Americans and other minorities to the economic status of well-off whites. Examples of the latter abound, from re-enslaving African Americans after the Civil War through the use of work gangs, to targeting black communities for enforcement during the \"war on drugs,\" to stigmatizing Latinos through heavy-handed enforcement of immigration laws. All of this has produced an us-versus-them mentality among those on the short end of the nightstick. Another perceptive article along these lines is [*Johann Hari's piece in the current *In These Times**](http://inthesetimes.com/article/17536/the_war_on_billie_holiday) about how the government brought the full weight of anti-drug enforcement on black jazz artists such as Billie Holiday while giving prominent white dopers a pass, over the fear that jazz represented \"evidence of a recurrence of the primitive impulses that lurk in black people, waiting to emerge.\"\n\nThis is why many communities, especially lower-income African American communities, justifiably regard the police as an occupying force. Efforts started in the 1960s to hire more minority officers (which, as we have seen, didn't go very far in Ferguson and other cities) were correctly seen by many as putting a more familiar face on a still-oppressive relationship.\n\nBlaming the police only goes so far, for they didn't create the poverty, racism and exploitation that they're charged with keeping in check. Indeed, individual officers are themselves victims of the system, thrown into communities that don't want them around. Rare these days is the police officer setting out on patrol with the intent of killing anyone, but the combination of arms and fear (on both sides) can cause routine enforcement to spiral into violence. Darren Wilson certainly didn't gain anything by killing Michael Brown; Brown lost his life, but Wilson lost his job and will go through life a marked man.\n\nThe only solution to police violence, therefore, is to end the conditions that cause it. Minority communities need good jobs, health care, affordable housing and high-quality education; without these things they will rightly feel more like occupied territories than part of America. This will take much greater political will than simply asking police officers to smile and giving them cameras. It will take a re-thinking of how our society functions, of how to make our country work for everyone. It will take, in short, a generous dose of socialist thinking.","order":9},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—February 2015 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"February 2015","order":-1,"date":"2015-02-02","body":"** **\n\n**Welcome to the February 2015 issue of the *Washington Socialist*, the email newsletter of Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America. **\n\nWell, February.

Public services that affect everyone are under the radar that way, but sometimes events make it plain.\n\n-   That dichotomy hits the public head-on when ubiquitous services like public power are exposed as (for instance in Maryland, Virginia and the District) the corporate monopolies that they are. Public hearings are under way in Maryland and the District because a big corporate octopus – PEPCO– seeks to be absorbed by an even bigger corporate octopus, Chicago-based and nuke-heavy Exelon.

Adkins","body":"***\"Humans\"*** is a British-American sci-fi series that has run on the AMC and Channel 4. The first season of eight shows is over, but there will be a second season in 2016. The series *Humans* is unique in that it occurs in a future where industrialized countries in the near future have robot helpers called synths. These synths, which look like humans, interact by speech, do chores, and remind us to take our meds. The plot gets interesting when we learn that a genius computer scientist has made a \"family\" of synths that are self-aware or sentient. These conscious synths are being hunted by a police agency for reasons that are not clear. What makes the synths interesting are that they can think, feel, and grow mentally just like the rest of us. The idea that robots would have a personality based on their own social history adds a dimension to the story.\n\nLearning by socialization was a part of *Star Trek: the Next Generation*'s Data character and is beginning to be part of the plot in several new Sci Fi films, including *Her*.\n\nThe previous model for robots was that they were mass-produced and identical. However, as our Internet use becomes transcribed into personal profiles of ourselves, and soon involves our dolls, the idea that computers can learn from experience is becoming common.\n\nThe plot also focuses on a human family that ends up owning a synth, which (who?) is self-aware. Much of the plot revolves round the human family and the sentient synth bonding with and learning from each other.\n\nAlthough there is no direct democratic socialist content to this series at the moment, how computers will impact our work and life in the near future is probably on all our minds. Already there are films showing the incompatibility of using self-aware robots as enslaved persons. Many of us will live long enough to see at least some of this tech be realized.\n\n**Footnote on the future**: In time for this Christmas, computer scientists and AI specialists working for Mattel may have produced a new doll, *Hello Barbie*. This is sad news for socialist feminists as Barbie has been shown to be bad for young girls' physical self-image. The doll cannot but help but replicate some social values and which ones will be telling. The new doll has a Wi-Fi connection and a computer to allow discussions with young girls. The Wi-Fi connection builds and saves a girl's profile, which is used as the doll's memory (corporate resource anyone). The new doll will have 8,000 lines of coded conversation and is reported to be a good listener and will remember who is in your family.\n\nFor more info see [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans\\_(TV\\_series*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_%28TV_series)) and for fun read New York Times, Sept. 16, 2015, Barbie Wants to Get to Know Your Child [*http://nyti.ms/1Mrxp11*](http://nyti.ms/1Mrxp11)\n\nThe future is closer than you think.","order":0},{"title":"Bernie Sanders, Black Lives Matter, and Seizing the Moment- An Overview and Orientation","date":"2015-09-30","issue":"October 2015","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"**** \"I did not say anything. I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice and the expression in vain. We had heard them ... and had read them ... now for a long time, and I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it. ... Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages, the number of roads, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates.\" Ernest Hemingway, **A Farewell to Arms** (1929, Shocken edition 1969 p. 185)\n\n**Considerations**\n\nAs Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign continues to gather support, he comes under ever sharper scrutiny – not only by Republican and Democratic Party opponents, but by others who are themselves working to address the social inequities that abound in our society. Some such criticism is itself destructive; the tendency to view every insufficient step forward as a form of betrayal is a charge that every alternative candidate from Eugene Debs to Jesse Jackson has faced. Yet criticism and debate is a healthy and necessary part of the process of building a social justice movement that is rooted in the diverse and unequal experiences of our society. The idea that unity can be created solely by seeking to overcome economic inequality — as a goal shared by all working people — while putting all other concerns on the backburner is false; all such attempts have come to grief on the realities of how people understand the world they inhabit. As the history of organized labor has repeatedly shown, division is not caused by those who have challenged racism or sexism, those who have challenged discrimination in any form – rather division is caused by the reality of such discrimination and perpetuated by those who wish to close their eyes to truths others know to be true through experience.\n\nThe importance of incorporating that experience in the Sanders campaign was expressed in an article by Bill Fletcher Jr. \"The suggestion that race can be resolved through an appeal to class and economic justice alone suggests that economic justice will equally resolve the racial differential,\" Fletcher wrote.\n\n\"It is not simply a matter of 'a rising tide raises all boats'. The reality is that all boats may rise, but who finds one's self in which portion of each boat? Or, to use the metaphor of the Titanic, who is in steerage and who is closer to the main deck?\n\n\"When movements like \\#BlackLivesMatter and many in the immigrant rights movement point to this matter of racial injustice, they are not suggesting attention for a 'special interest.' Rather, they are pointing out that there can actually be no economic justice in the absence of racial justice. There can be no unity without a commitment to the fight for equality and justice. These struggles are interlinked. The sort of 'political revolution' that the Sanders Campaign proclaims has been a long time coming. Yet it will never arrive if there is not a full recognition that the class struggle overlaps that of racial justice. The ruling elites, for several centuries, have appreciated that race is the trip wire of U.S. politics and social movements. When will progressives arrive at the same conclusion?\"\n\nWhat follows is a consideration of several ways of connecting the dots to which Fletcher alludes. Taken together as an overview they may inform an orientation toward the Sanders campaign in its specificity and toward the broader challenge of addressing universality and difference, of building a unity that is genuine because it is built upon an appreciation of the fuller dimension of how social injustices impact upon individuals in all aspects of life.\n\n**Courage **\n\nThe late comedian George Carlin once did a whole riff on how we overvalue the word \"courage.\" Courage on behalf of what is the question that lies begging – courage when engaging in brutal and cruel behavior, in the midst of brutal and cruel warfare, does nothing to change the underlying reality of pain and suffering inflicted upon those who are victims. This glorification of \"courage\" without reference to content is upheld too when someone is praised for speaking his or her (but almost always it is a \"he\" being praised) mind without softening words or bowing to \"political correctness.\" Ignored is the veracity of what is being said, for only the tone is praised – and ignored too is whether the words are used hurt others, hinder understanding, promote hate. The use of abstract words to distort the meaning they are presumed to have speaks to Hemingway's critique of language.\n\nNonetheless courage – and indeed integrity, freedom, democracy, equality – can be made meaningful words, but only so long as they are linked to broader purposes, so long as they become concrete. It is this definition of courage that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (a once-brilliant basketball player, an always-thoughtful and principled human being) applied in a recent *Washington Post* op-ed that helps shed light on the relationship of Bernie Sanders to Black Lives Matter and, beyond that, says a great deal about political choices that need to be made over and again. To quote:\n\n\"Ernest Hemingway once said that courage was 'grace under pressure.' Two presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, have recently tested this proposition. And how each man responded revealed the type of person he is and the type of president he would make: Trump authored his own doom, and Sanders opened immense new possibilities as a compassionate person and serious candidate for president.\"\n\nThe negative example Abdul-Jabbar uses is Trump's crude and bullying response to Megyn Kelly's questions about his publicly contemptuous attitudes toward women. As Kareem notes, Trump's response was not only an attack on women, but also an attack on the First Amendment – for free speech and freedom of the press themselves become empty terms when someone in position of power uses their voice to attack and silence others. It was an approach Trump also took toward Univision, when refusing to answer questions about his attacks on Mexican immigrants – and his veiled threat to the First Amendment goes in tandem with his direct attack on the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment which gives citizenship rights to immigrants but also significantly gave citizenship rights to black Americans, rights denied notwithstanding generations of having lived in this country.\n\nAnd that brings us to the contrast with Sanders, for the article goes on to say,\n\n\"... Bernie Sanders faced his own challenge at a political event ... when two African American women pushed in front of him to use the microphone to demand four and a half minutes of silence to honor the death of Michael Brown. Sanders left the stage and mingled with the crowd. Later, Trump criticized Sanders as being 'weak' for allowing them to speak, but truly he showed grace under pressure by acknowledging their frustration and anger. Instead of bullying their voices into silence or ridiculing them as losers, pigs or bimbos, Sanders left. After all, it was not his event; he was a guest. Besides, his voice was not silenced, but came back booming even louder: The next day, Sanders posted a sweeping policy of reform to fight racial inequality.\"\n\n**Context**\n\nThe emergence of Black Lives Matter and the ever-widening support for Sanders anti-austerity message and call for a \"political revolution\" stem from the same source – the deepening patterns of inequality and insecurity that remain even in the midst of current economic growth and job growth. The stagnation in the US economy has lasted more than a generation now, and has been accompanied by an atrophying of our political system in which corporate power is expressed ever more openly and directly. The sense that there is no way out, that the system has failed, is the basis of the appeal not only of Trump, but more generally of Republican politicians and ideologists who use the sense of grievance, the sense of loss and decline, to point fingers and lay blame. Key to that is the separation of societal problems faced by most from the problems of inequality faced by many within the overall sense of our country's decline; a separation which makes it easy to shift responsibility for the current state of affairs from corporate power to those who were excluded during the putative \"good times\" of a past long gone – be that working women, be that Latino (or Asian or Muslim) immigrants, be that African Americans unwilling to live second-class lives. Because a system with separate and unequal categories of rights can't be justified in so direct a fashion, it manifests itself in cultural issues, in attacks on abortion or gay marriage, in promoting fear of black crime or Arab terrorism or Latino drug dealers, in rhetoric about anchor babies and \"illegals,\" and in both rationalizations of violence against women and the use of racialized tropes to project fear of people of color assaulting \"our\" women – and thus to justify police and vigilante-style attacks upon those deemed \"other.\"\n\nSuch a line of thought can be projected in \"objective\" social forms of charter schools, gentrification, bank lending practices that lead to disparities in wealth, health, education, employment or in the demagogic blaming-the-victim forms taken today by Trump, Cruz, Walker and their ilk. But what is relevant here is that an attempt to overcome injustices by a change in economic policy alone is insufficient to redirect people's anger or hopes. For the appeal of conservatives lies in the pretense that a measure of economic security and opportunity will be possible if the egalitarian impulse of those who have less is rejected. And hence the need for advocates of universal measures ranging from health care to all to living wage initiatives to also address the issues of inequality – and issues of war, civil liberties, the environment, the whole panoply of concerns that are in fact if not always in immediate appearance, class issues inherent in the conflict between labor and capital. The increase of violence and fear of violence in everyday life is coextensive with the increase in insecurity, the point Angela Davis made in a talk given in February when the focus of popular anger was centered on Ferguson:\n\n\"... 'Why the mobilizations now?' Davis asked. Some would assume it's because so many black men and boys have been killed within a short amount of time; however, she reminded us that the issue of black men being targets of police violence is [*not a new occurrence*](http://inthesetimes.com/article/17398/darren_wilson_not_indicted), and it is important to correct the notion that it is. 'There has been an unbroken line of racist police killings since the era of slavery,' Davis declared. Davis directly attributes [*police militarization to the war on terror*](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/11/how-the-war-on-terror-has-militarized-the-police/248047/), also saying that the war on terror has redefined what it means to be an immigrant and legitimized anti-Muslim prejudice and violence. ... \\[therefore\\] when addressing racism, other inequalities cannot be ignored. Racial and sexual violence are two modes of violence that have, historically, been particularly overlooked as well as allowed and accepted. 'The pandemic of intimate violence is not disconnected from state violence,' Davis said. She then called upon us all to 'speak out against economic exploitation, against war, against the destruction of the environment, against anti-Muslimism and anti-Semitism, against gender bias and homophobia, for access to good organic non-GMO food, for free health care and free education for all.' \"\n\n**Connections**\n\nThe linkage of issue to issue is not the same as a laundry list that includes one item after another, united only by being written on the same piece of paper. Rather such inclusion speaks to how the lives of each and all are complex and themselves interconnected. And it only serves those who wish to maintain existing relationships of power and subordination to pretend otherwise. The legal challenges to labor law which, if successful, could largely undo the protections (weak and under assault as they be) are certainly distinct from various proposal designed to both make the lot of immigrants currently in the US more precarious, to lock many of them into a permanent system of lesser rights, and to make entry into the country more dangerous and more desperate. And indeed they are and do require distinct responses. So too are the issues of poverty and hunger distinct from the issue of choice and reproductive health for women. Yet so too they are as one for they are connected in the bodies and lives of those who experience them as a totality.\n\nDolores Huerta, a founder and Vice President emeritus of the United Farm Workers (and an honorary chair of Democratic Socialists of America), certainly has lived these together and the work she has done as an organizer and activist has been all these arenas – the struggle for an end to poverty and for union representation, the demand for women's rights and the rights of immigrants. A unity in difference is evident in her defense of Planned Parenthood:\n\n\"People who oppose women's access to health care have spent years attacking Planned Parenthood with too many smears and distortions to count. But the one that truly makes my blood boil is the claim that because so many women who turn to Planned Parenthood are people of color ... Planned Parenthood must be racist! A spokesperson for the right-wing Libre Initiative just made this attack, accusing Planned Parenthood of 'target\\[ing\\] minority communities' and of working to diminish the 'political power' of women of color. ... When we say that Planned Parenthood does extensive work in communities of color, that's because women in those communities are deciding for themselves that they need the help Planned Parenthood offers. When a woman — especially a low-income woman — needs or desires access to contraception, a cancer screening, and yes, even an abortion, she can go to Planned Parenthood. Having that access means she has the ability to control her own health and her own future. That is not targeting or diminishing women. Instead, it's allowing them to have the dignity of making their own medical decisions, a right that so many people in the United States take for granted but that Latinas are too often denied. ...\n\n\"To put it simply: Attacking Planned Parenthood for providing Latinas with reproductive health services is another way of saying that Latinas shouldn't have access to reproductive health services at all. If some people want to attack Planned Parenthood, that's their right. But they should be honest about what they're attacking. They're attacking our access to health care, birth control and abortion.\"\n\nIn her remarks we see the same logic that asked the Sanders campaign to address issues of racism and police violence – not as a distraction from his demand for universal economic justice for all, but to strengthen that demand. It was a logic that he and his campaign understood and are increasingly coming to embrace.\n\n**Closing the Circle**\n\nReturning to a contrasting comparison along the lines made by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Cornel West \\[amongst his many other distinctions, West is also an honorary chair of DSA\\] stated in an interview that:\n\n\"Brother Bernie andBrother Trumpshare one thing in common: They speak to the anti-establishment impulse among those who are looking for some candidates who are for real, as opposed to the superficial, donor-driven politicians that usually are dominant in any election cycle. \\[Trump\\] says,*I have been a donor, I have been a participant in this corrupt system for 30 years*. But all of a sudden now he's going to make America great again? No. Plutocratic corruption of government is unpatriotic. I don't know how you're going to be so much in love with America but you're participating in plutocratic corruption of the system and then you wake up now 30 years later and say, 'Lo and behold, I'm going to be the savior of overcoming the corruption.' No, that lacks integrity. He has authenticity, but he doesn't have integrity. Bernie Sanders has authenticity, but he's also got integrity. Integrity, of course, doesn't mean that you agree with everything that a politician does. But it's just so rare that you get authenticity and integrity.\"\n\n\"Authenticity,\" like \"courage\" can be reduced to rhetoric without substance, yet rhetoric which finds a chord amongst people with a desire for public speech that is direct and unadulterated, unlike the poll-driven language devoid of belief offered up by most Republican (and Democratic) candidates for higher office. But addressing popular discontent and promising change, without challenging the corporate power at the center of our economic and political system can only find one outlet – scapegoating people; a \"populist\" racism is the only place authenticity such as Trump's can go.\n\nOn the other hand, the integrity of Sanders is connected to a critique of the structural economic and political injustices rooted in capitalist society, injustices which give political meaning to the projection of a socialist alternative, injustices which can only be addressed by opposing all forms of such injustice rather than appealing to some in order to further step on others. West sees Sanders' integrity in those terms, terms which allow him to make a deeper and fuller critique of contemporary US capitalism than does Sanders. West has been doing that, most recently when campaigning with and for Bernie in South Carolina. In the same interview as quoted above, he explains how he sees those interconnections:\n\n\"... how do we come up with a language that allows a coalescing to take place, so that we don't end up with narrow talk about diversity and inclusion within aneoliberalframework? That is basically what the Democratic Party is all about. It's about diversity and inclusion within a neoliberal framework. That's got to be radically called into question. You can call it into question in the name of fighting against white supremacy. Wonderful. You can call it into question in the name of fighting against economic injustice and class inequality. That's wonderful.\n\n\"But when it comes to movements, we've got to interweave the struggle against white supremacy with the struggle against economic injustice, with the struggle against homophobia, with the struggle against patriarchy, and any form of xenophobia. Anti-Jewish hatred, anti-Palestinian hatred, anti-Arab hatred, anti-Muslim hatred. How do we talk about all of those simultaneously?\n\n\"Twenty-five years ago, people talked about it in terms of fighting for radical democracy. Once you have the empowerment of everyday people across the board, then you're able to wed what people traditionally call 'identity politics' with what people call 'class-centered politics' because the two are so inseparable that you can't talk about one without the other. I think there's something to be said for that position.\"\n\nIt is a position we can now fight for and through the Sanders campaign. Rather than ask people who feel left out to silence their voices, we can construct a path that makes the inseparability between \"identity politics,\" and \"class-centered politics\" central to all socialist politics.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMost of those who are active in building Sanders' campaign, just as most of those active in the streets protesting police violence, are young. A contrast to the voices in the articles above – although themselves of differing generations, it is true that Huerta, Davis, Abdul-Jabbar, West and Fletcher all were decisively influenced by the transformations and struggles of the '60s and '70s, whether in the heart of them or just coming of age in that era. And this influences the perspective they bring to bear on the issues of the intersectionality of race, gender, nationality and class, on the relationship between movement and electoral politics – even given the significant differences between them (as can be gleaned in the varying emphasis in the perspectives noted above). The period – roughly coinciding from the Montgomery Bus Boycott through to Nixon's resignation – saw a tremendous upsurge of activism which sought to expand the gains of the New Deal to the country as a whole, an expansion which brought to the surface hidden/suppressed tensions and manifested itself in an enormous number of political, cultural and social movements which transformed our society, yet fell short of needed social transformation. Instead we had the reaction of Reagan, of neo-liberalism, of the Democratic Leadership Council, of a sharpened conflict between so-called identity politics and a narrow supposed class politics that saw each other as the problem. As reaction continued, such tensions became muted in a shared attempt to maintain some radical vision, some measure of progressive politics.\n\nToday we are in a renewed moment where popular movements are again on the offensive, demanding what could be rather than simply resisting another loss. In such circumstances it is not surprising that there are disagreements over how to move forward, how to be inclusive without privileging one voice over the other. To date, certainly, it seems that much has been learned from the past; we are not seeing a replay of the dynamic that undermined transformatory politics two generations ago. Still, the danger remains. And, yet and so too does the possibility of concretizing hope in a way that can rebuild our democracy, establish social justice, and give greater relevance to a socialist project as diverse as our society, as united as our collective needs. It is a perspective which can be furthered through the Sanders campaign so long as we root the political in the everyday experience of life in a society with multiple forms of hierarchy and division. The possibility of such taking place may be gleaned in a resolution adopted this summer by National Nurses United entitled \"Black Lives Matter and the Health Impact of Societal Racial Disparities\":\n\n\"While there are clear correlations between structural racism in the criminal justice system and economic and social justice, each area is also a clear and present danger to life and health, as well as an infringement on the human rights of those affected and on American democracy. As nurses, we are dedicated to preventing all forms of illness, protecting health, and alleviating human suffering. ... \\[therefore the\\] NNU supports efforts at comprehensive solutions including, but not limited to:\n\n-   **Comprehensive criminal justice reforms**, including national > standards for greater public oversight, accountability, and > prosecution for rights violations ...\n\n-   **Systemic prison and sentencing reform** to reduce mass > incarcerations and disparities, and improved prison and jail > health services.\n\n-   **Genuine, universal guaranteed healthcare** based on a single > standard of quality care for everyone ...\n\n-   **An end to austerity economic policie**s that disproportionately > affect minority populations. ....\"\n\nThat resolution was consistent with the one the NNU adopted shortly thereafter on the presidential campaign: \"Caring, compassion, and community. These are the values at the heart of registered nursing. This is true at the bedside, as nurses advocate for patients and families—and also beyond the walls of the hospital, as RNs call for [*environmental*](http://www.nationalnursesunited.org/state/environmental-justice), [*racial*](http://www.nationalnursesunited.org/press/entry/nnu-statement-on-black-lives-matter-and-the-health-impact-of-societal-racia/)*,* and [*economic*](http://www.robinhoodtax.org/) justice in the name of public health. National Nurses United, which represents some 190,000 nurses nationwide, seeks to uphold that positive vision for the health of this country by endorsing Senator Bernie Sanders for president.\"\n\nGrace under pressure unites all such movements in multiple ways as this overview seeks to show – courage of convictions rests in the grace given through respect to one and all.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Sources:**\n\nBill Fletcher Jr. – \"Why We Cannot Speak of Economic Injustice Alone, or, Why Race Matters\" *Democratic Left*, 8/28/15\n\n[*http://www.dsausa.org/why\\_we\\_cannot\\_speak\\_of\\_economic\\_injustice\\_alone\\_or\\_why\\_race\\_matters*](http://www.dsausa.org/why_we_cannot_speak_of_economic_injustice_alone_or_why_race_matters)\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar – This is the Difference Between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, Washington Post, 9/2/15\n\n[*http://portside.org/2015-09-05/kareem-abdul-jabbar-difference-between-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders*](http://portside.org/2015-09-05/kareem-abdul-jabbar-difference-between-donald-trump-and-bernie-sanders)\n\nSummer Noble – Angela Davis Speaks on Racism and Police Militarization at Annual MLK Jr. Convocation\" *Huffington Post,* 4/4/15\n\n[*http://www.huffingtonpost.com/summer-noble/angela-davis-speaks-on-ra\\_b\\_6601260.html*](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/summer-noble/angela-davis-speaks-on-ra_b_6601260.html)\n\nDolores Huerta –\"Shame on Those Who Smear Planned Parenthood, an Essential Resource to Latinos,\" *People for the American Way* *Blog*, 8/27/15\n\n[*http://www.pfaw.org/category/people/dolores-huerta*](http://www.pfaw.org/category/people/dolores-huerta)\n\nZeeshan Aleem – \"Cornell West Speaks About Endorsing Bernie Sanders, Black Lives Matter and Donald Trump,\" *Policy.Mic*, 8/26/15\n\n[*http://mic.com/articles/124427/cornel-west-talks-about-endorsing-bernie-sanders-black-lives-matter-and-donald-trump\\#*](http://mic.com/articles/124427/cornel-west-talks-about-endorsing-bernie-sanders-black-lives-matter-and-donald-trump)\n\nNNU – \"Statement on Black Lives Matter and the Health Impact of Societal Racial Disparities,\" *National Nurses United Press Release*, 7/23/15\n\n[*https://talkingunion.wordpress.com/page/3/*](https://talkingunion.wordpress.com/page/3/)\n\nNNU – \"National Nurses United Endorses Senator Bernie Sanders for President,\" *National Nurses United Press Release*, 8/17/15\n\n<http://www.nationalnursesunited.org/site/entry/vote-nurses-values>","order":1},{"title":"Clinton, the Successor to Reagan","date":"2015-09-30","issue":"October 2015","author":"Dave Richardson","body":"A review of *The Extreme Centre: A Warning* By Tariq Ali (Verso, 2015)\n\n*By Dave Richardson*\n\nI have always wondered why it was so important for Bill Clinton to push NAFTA, which undermined working conditions for the bottom 80 percent in both the U.S. and Mexico, through Congress. This especially galls me inasmuch as, while George H. W. Bush was in favor of it, the Democrats blocked it until Clinton came in. I've also wondered why Clinton did away with traditional welfare, replacing it with the temporary TANF program, which threw so many families, very largely his supporters, into extreme poverty. The 2000 repeal of the Glass-Steagal Act, which eliminated financial regulations which might have prevented the 2008 financial collapse, also occurred on Clinton's watch.\n\nTariq Ali presents the case that the political dominance of the extreme centre bears the responsibility. *The Extreme Centre* itself is a long op-ed, which offers an explanation in the parallel history of the U.S. and the U.K., with the Democrats continuing and fulfilling the programs of Ronald Reagan and the British Labor Party doing the same with respect to the programs of Margaret Thatcher. In both cases, \"\\[t\\]hey refuse to step down and talk to the people whose worlds they have destroyed.\" (p. 4) Even the names they gave themselves, Clinton's Third Way and Tony Blair's New Labor, evoke similar images, that of turning away from the needs and concerns of their supporters.\n\nThe term \"extreme centre\" refers to the hard right turn after 1989 by the more conservative parties followed by a similar turn by the more progressive parties as they followed suit. As Ali puts it, \"\\[w\\]hen the Berlin Wall went down in 1989, it took European Social Democracy with it.\" (p. 2) Further, \"\\[c\\]apitalism, intoxicated by its victory and unchallenged from any quarter, no longer felt the need to protect its left flank by conceding any more reforms. ... social democracy became redundant.\" (pp. 2-3) Not only that, but earlier reforms had to be rolled back in the name of reform or progress or some other nice-sounding term.\n\nAli is a master of words, and once we come across the term \"extreme centre,\" we have an aha! experience and understand just what has happened. Similarly, he refers to most of the quasi-independent states scattered across the globe as \"U.S. protectorates,\" with the U.K. as a \"U.S. vassal,\" once again terms that clarify a lot of recent world history. Referring to countries as protectorates seems to me superior to just invoking \"the Empire,\" for its specificity and obvious connection to reality. \"The Empire,\" on the other hand, incorrectly connotes some kind of similarity to the very different British or Roman empires.\n\nIn Britain Blair's New Labor kept the trade unions at arms' length, and after two years in office \"the gap between executive salaries and the average wage was the largest in Europe.\" (p. 22) \"Between 1990 and 1996 a million people lost their homes through repossession, while 390,000\" formerly publicly owned homes were repossessed. (p. 22) At the very beginning of its term, New Labor cut single mothers' welfare by 11 pounds per week and established tuition for the previously-free public universities, policies that the Conservatives hadn't been willing to even propose. (p. 26) These 'reforms' didn't make much of an impression on the budget, but they sent a message: New Labor had chosen which side it was on.\n\nDespite its brilliance, at 192 pp. the book itself is probably 172 pp. too long for the American reader. Born in what is now Pakistan, Ali has lived in Britain since he matriculated at Oxford University in the early 1960s, and is naturally much more concerned with the U.K., and Europe in general, than the U.S. Thus, in a sense, this review misrepresents the book by its overwhelming American emphasis. While we all know about the enormous fortune acquired by the Clintons after Bill left office, Ali spends 12 pages documenting the largesse received by members of the cabinet of Blair and his successor Gordon Brown after they were replaced\nby the Tories.\n\n*The Extreme Centre* is dedicated to Hugo Chavez, and a great deal of Ali's hope for the future rests on the independence movement in Latin America, where Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia have thrown off the U.S. protectorate, established themselves as independent countries, and encouraged other countries in the region to follow. Nevertheless, independence movements have been crushed in Haiti, Honduras, and Paraguay, while Brazil seems to have lost its way and is imposing austerity, and Argentina is struggling in U.S courts with debt problems.\n\nAnother challenge comes from the BRICS group, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The heart of this group is China, which by some measures has surpassed the U.S. in terms of the size of its economy. The main threat from China is that its economy may soon be so large that it will be able to afford military expenditures that the U.S. cannot match, and hence the rate of economic growth is the key number to watch. In his discussion, however, Ali loses his way by diverting attention to a great many side issues and thus downplaying the main story.\n\nAli really does have a way with words, as you may have noticed from the quotes above, and *The Extreme Centre* is an enjoyable read. However, his case fits together a little bit too well, and I am concerned that the background data is being massaged a bit more than I am comfortable with. Nevertheless, his brilliance cannot be denied, and no serious student of politics can afford to be ignorant of his views.\n\n**Appendix I**: THE CLINTON RECORD, more completely\n\nNot only did Clinton abandon \"any pretense of a New Deal,\" (p. 20) but NAFTA really hurt, and \"\\[i\\]n 1998, the \\[real\\] wages of the bottom 80% were lower than they had been in 1989, and significantly lower than in 1979.\" (p. 24) The U.S. is the only capitalist country where workers have actually had to increase their hours to maintain their living standards, if not just to survive. The march of inequality continued apace, as the ratio of CEO incomes to those of ordinary workers, which had increased from 42:1 in 1980 to 85:1 in 1990, quadrupled to 326:1 in 1997. (p. 24) \"The ruling elites ... which so vigorously and shamelessly promoted their political system to win over the peoples of Eastern Europe, are now quietly disencumbering themselves of that very system.\" (p. 10)\n\nIn fairness, we should note that Clinton has pushed through some reasonably progressive legislation, e.g., his 1993 tax cut for the middle & lower classes, which simultaneously raised them for the top 1.2 percent. He also reversed the Reagan/Bush restrictions on abortions, expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, and saw the passage of the Brady Bill, with a 5-day waiting period for handgun purchases. Overseas, yielding to pressure he returned Aristide to office in Haiti, withdrew US support for UNITA in Angola, and supported the overthrow of Mobutu in Zaire/Congo. However, the effect of these progressive victories pales in comparison with the major harm imposed by NAFTA, the elimination of welfare, the undermining of financial regulation, and his budget surpluses, which led directly to the 2001 recession.\n\nMore mixed is Clinton's don't ask, don't tell policy for the military, which seemed progressive at the time but not later. And he famously tried and failed to establish a health care system for all. On the anti-progressive side, he pushed through DOMA, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman, bombed Serbia, maintained the murderous Iraq sanctions regime, and left Somalia a failed state. For his troubles he was rewarded by earnings of over $160 million in the period 2001 to 2011, and much more since.\n\n**Appendix II:** THE OBAMA RECORD\n\nLest we think that Obama has been any better, we should consider that his term in office has been one of unending recession, largely as a result of his 2009 $787 billion economic stimulus package, which was known at the time to be too small. Nevertheless, he found $3,000 billion to bail out financial and real estate enterprises, with hardly a crumb for underwater homeowners. At the same time, Obama is trying to double down on NAFTA with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and a similar Atlantic trade deal. And he shares with Clinton the distinction of being the ones who have destroyed the Democratic Party by eliminating its hold on Congress and state governments.\n\nObama also has some real progressive achievements, especially in terms of Obamacare, which expanded Medicaid in addition to making health insurance affordable for millions. He also saw through the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which relaxed the statute of limitations on equal pay lawsuits, expanded SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and put through Dodd -Frank, which pretended to restore regulation to the financial sector and actually did set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And he may yet make millions eligible for overtime pay. Overseas he established diplomatic relations with Cuba and negotiated the Iran nuclear treaty.\n\nMore mixed are Obama's efforts to end Iraq and Afghan Wars and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, which continued the Bush tax cuts but achieved some progressive goals.\n\nOn the anti-progressive side, he walked away from his campaign pledge to pass card-check union recognition. He proposed budget sequestration, which has undermined the ability of the federal government to fulfill its mission, and has undermined public education by pushing charter schools. Obama disregarded elections in Egypt, Haiti, Honduras, Paraguay, Ukraine and Venezuela. The effect of this was a failed attempt to end Venezuelan independence, but a successful move to establish a U.S. protectorate in Ukraine. Disregarding elections in the other four prevented them from establishing themselves as independent states free of U.S. protection. In the pursuit of new protectorates, Obama created failed states in Libya, Syria, and now Yemen.","order":2},{"title":"Culture, Politics, and Black Lives Matter","date":"2015-09-30","issue":"October 2015","author":"Daniel C. Adkins","body":"American culture has some advantages and some blind spots. One tendency of some younger Americans is to believe that the world was created when they were born and anything before that is just history and therefore not important. The advantage to this belief is that some parents are not automatically able to share their prejudices with their children and aspects of racism are diminished. However, the disadvantage is that one misses understanding the flow of history. We remain ignorant of our people's and the world's diverse histories.\n\nThis weakness becomes clearer, for example, when President George W. Bush gets us into an Iraq war without understanding the centuries-old conflict between Sunni and Shiite Islam. He believed any Shiite backing the invasion was for democracy and the U.S. Some Shiites had their own agenda: Shiite domination (or, in Iraq, Payback). In the Iraq War our leaders were blinded by ideology and a lack of cultural and political understanding.\n\nSo if you do not know your history you will be less prepared to effect change and less prepared to recognize the allies that you will need. One disadvantage of ignoring history, to take a very current example, is that you fail to take into account America's original sins: slavery and native genocide. Slavery was an economic mode that kept blacks' wages down to zero for the profit of the slave-masters and a social racism that cemented their political power. It was amazing that Jefferson wrote that \"all men are created equal\" in the age of absolute monarchy. But the sad reality is that this slave-owner's personal life never matched his ideals. Jefferson was able to abolish the slave trade (1807) but it took the Civil War to end slavery. The postwar Reconstruction period involved white Southerners reestablishing their control by discriminatory laws, marginal educational opportunities for African-Americans, and terror. The terror ranged from Ku Klux Klan raids and lynching to enforced servitude and Jim Crow segregation, which functioned to economically depress African-American wages and education.\n\nDespite the perceptions of the broader public, for many African Americans today it is not clear that the terror or Jim Crow has ended, with police shootings and mysterious hanging \"suicides.\" Ferguson, Mo., known best for a singular police shooting of an unarmed young black man, has also exemplified law enforcement that uses fines as a \"police department profit center,\" with arrests leading to unaffordable bail that keeps African-Americans destabilized in the community and workplace. Only 16 percent of those arrested can make bail, often for nonviolent offenses that don't seem to require bail.\n\nThe militarization of local police (in Ferguson and throughout the nation) creates an \"us or them\" logic that erases citizen-government ties. These practices have revised the police motto of \"Protect and Serve\" to \"Exploit and Sabotage\" in some towns.\n\nAmazingly, the example of Ferguson and the policy of police militarization misses the lesson learned in the Iraq surge. The surge's main goal was protecting the population from each other and Al Qaida, not killing insurgents. The surge in Iraq succeeded in defeating Al Qaida by moving troops into Iraqi neighborhoods to protect them and learn from them. The militarization of police in the US does the opposite and makes it more difficult to talk to citizens and to know neighborhoods.\n\nFerguson shows history repeating itself with a local white-led government using tactics that extract revenues from African-Americans, keep them poor, and sabotage a sense of community. If you do know your history you are not surprised at man's urge to profit from others in unequal power relationships, and then you are better prepared to do something about it. Still, you have to wonder if the past has even passed. Certainly the Black Lives Matter movement that began in Ferguson is trying to make sure the echoes of history are not overlooked.\n\nWhen it comes to remedies, many white progressives identify with Senator Bernie Sanders' policies, see them as a remedy for many kinds of inequalities, and support him. The last recession, and illuminating responses such as Occupy Wall Street, made clearer how the billionaire class was running the country and us into the ground. The logic of capitalism and its \"free market\" enablers in Wall Street and the government have allowed the nation's profits to fall into the hands of the super rich. This has led to no new raises for the middle class and cuts in support and opportunity for the poor. Today's middle class has more financial instability with two wage-earners today than with one in the 1950s. New college grads are often faced with loan debts (profits for banks and the government) that sabotage their family life. The poor and many minorities face an even steeper road and less support out of poverty. Success today is enabled with early childhood educational enrichments that are often out of reach of the poor who face marginal schools. Capitalism afflicts both middle class and poor, but the effects are different.\n\nBernie Sanders's campaign gives the 99 percent a chance to push back against inequality overall. But his economic programs and proposals do not specifically focus on minorities, and Ferguson has shown us that some policies targeting the poor need to change.\n\nBlack Lives Matter is an organic and vigorous response to deadly police tactics. BLM and Bernie got off to a rough start, when activists interrupted one of his speeches and were booed by some of the audience. But despite the bad start a dialog was begun. Some Bernie supporters were slow to see the necessity of allying with BLM. With all the talk of diversity, we are still caught up in our own communities, cultures, and histories. This is a major weakness of all Americans, including progressives.\n\nSo progressives have focused on the economic aspects of inequality, envisioning social change in parallel. The minimum $15 per hour wage may free workers from multiple jobs and an 80-hour work week. This would give them a chance for a civic, political, and family life. More extensive education could allow black workers better jobs and a more stability. Health care as a right can minimize the main cause of bankruptcy. The failure of Ferguson was not just the police, but a system that undercut African-Americans from being the leaders in a community in which they are the majority. BLM is developing policies to support its objectives and Bernie will not be far behind.\n\nCombating the billionaire class and its off-shoots will require the alliance of all the colors of the rainbow. It will also require us to be more knowledgeable and respectful of all of our cultures as well as learning to work with allies. We need the empathy that come from understanding our allies and their histories. This empathy can not be based just on just books, but an understanding of how history has crippled lives and opportunities for the many while gaining riches for the few.\n\nADDENDUM: WHEN LIVES ARE SO DIFFERENT, HOW FAR CAN EMPATHY REACH?\n\nWorking as allies with Black Lives Matter (BLM) raises the question of whether white progressives can really empathize with African-Americans threatened by militarized and biased police. Below are two personal histories that question white capabilities in this matter.\n\nColonel Robert Gould Shaw was an abolitionist who commanded the Massachusetts 54<sup>th</sup> Regiment in the Civil War. He had joined the union army, fought in several battles, and had been wounded. He was given command and trained the newly formed Mass. 54<sup>th</sup> Regiment, one of the very first African-American regiments, which was sent to the South Carolina Sea Islands. On an advance into Confederate territory to destroy cotton and other supplies, Col. Shaw talked politely to the wife of a plantation owner. His troops were not amused. Afterward several of his African-American troops showed him the instruments of \"discipline\" and torture that were used to keep slaves in line. He got educated. In a battle after that episode Col. Shaw and many of his men died in an attack on the Confederate Fort Wagner. That attack ended the questioning of Black troops' valor and greatly expanded the use of African-American soldiers. You cannot ask more of someone than to give his or her life for the abolition of slavery, but intellectually understanding the horrors of a system cannot be compared to living in the system.\n\nWhen I saw the film the film *Glory* portraying the fight of the 54<sup>th</sup>, I cried. I could say that I cried for the men of the 54<sup>th</sup> fighting for liberty, and I did, but it was because I had lost someone who fought for liberty. In my life there has always been a hole where my biological father might have been. My father died leading a Marine platoon in attack on Iwo Jima (World War Two). In the attack, half of his men were either killed or wounded. When hit, he refused medical aid by the corpsman and ordered him to take care of the platoon's Marines first. He was shot again and died. My father took responsibility for confronting totalitarianism and for the care of his Marines. My belief in democratic socialism is an extrapolation of my father's action against fascism and his care for those around him. If you can die for your platoon and country, why not live for humanity and our home the Earth?\n\nSadly, people in the African-American community die by gunfire too. When they die by police action, poor police training, or racism on the part of those who should be helping and protecting them, it is a betrayal of our whole society. Although I have lost a loved one to gunfire, I do not claim to know the feelings of losing a loved one for no good reason.\n\nBLM is transforming these needless deaths into action to stop this madness and the evolution of Jim Crow keeping Black people down in new ways. BLM urgency can be seen as an effort to make the racist deaths have meaning. Already two police chiefs have been retired for racist behavior and more many police departments are rethinking their policies. BLM has given Bernie Sanders the priceless gift of realizing his need to get into sync with the African American community. Bernie has no chance of winning the presidency unless he gets strong support from the African American and Latino communities. BLM helped by giving him a wake-up call.\n\n*In this article I have used the word \"white\" with great reluctance because I find it humiliating that the word is still used to identify Euro-Americans the way the slaveholders defined it. It is too often used to polarize people, not to help our needed social unity.*","order":3},{"title":"GOOD READS FOR SOCIALISTS – OCTOBER 2015","date":"2015-09-30","issue":"October 2015","author":"","body":"More and more our good reads are coming from [*Portside*](http://portside.org/), an aggregator of left-interest articles.

The crisis has been compared to that of Greece, but the analogy is not correct. For background and ideas about how activists can become involved, I spoke with José La Luz, a DSA vice chair and veteran trade unionist, worker educator, and human rights activist. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. As*Democratic Left*went to press, the situation remained fluid.*\n\n**Gutiérrez**: **The current situation of Puerto Rico has been compared to that of Greece by some people, by others it has been compared to Detroit. What can you tell us about how you perceive the current economic crisis in Puerto Rico?**\n\n**La Luz**: Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has said that Puerto Rico is the Greece of the Caribbean. The only problem with that is that PR is not a sovereign country. PR is in fact the Greece of the United States, and that is what I want to get across to progressives in the United States. Puerto Rico being its largest territory, the United States bears some responsibility for this debt that has grown to more than 70 billion dollars. It is one of the highest per-capita debts in the world, even higher per capita than Greece.\n\n**Gutiérrez: Could you say something about how it got this way? The United States has a big debt, what does Puerto Rico's debt relate to?**\n\n**La Luz:** The increase in the debt of Puerto Rico is a result of the decline of the Puerto Rican economy. The manufacturing sector of Puerto Rico, which to this day is around 46% of the island's gross domestic product, has been adversely affected by U.S. trade policy and by the decision by Congress to phase out tax incentives that applied to Puerto Rico until December 2005. Like New York City in the 1970s and Detroit today, a decline in the manufacturing sector has led to lower revenues, a loss of jobs, and residents leaving the island. This decline in the economy has increased the need for social spending at the same time that revenues are decreasing. The increased debt has led to a decline in the credit rating of Puerto Rico, which before the crisis was positive. This has limited the ability of Puerto Rico to borrow money to counteract the decline in the private sector. It's a vicious cycle that had started just before the recession.\n\nTwo more factors have adversely affected the Puerto Rican economy. Under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, Puerto Rico has to ship goods using the U.S. merchant marine, whichincreases the cost of importing and exporting goods to the island. This law applies to Puerto Rico but not to other U.S. territories, such as the U.S. Virgin Islands. This billaffects the cost of living in Puerto Rico and should be phased out. Second, the cost of energy is high because most the island's electricity comes from petroleum. The island passed Law 82 in 2010 mandating increased use of renewable energy but it can't spend or borrow enough money to implement the mandate.\n\nThis debt has a direct impact on social spending. Programs that help the neediest are severely cut. It results in massive cuts in public services. The administration of Governor Luis Fortuño laid off more than 15,000 workers. In terms of the politics of austerity, it compares to Detroit in the sense that Detroit went bankrupt. The fiscal and budget crises there had a devastating impact on poor and working families. Yes, there are comparisons, but the fundamental difference is that Greece is a sovereign country and as such has some tools that it can use, including restructuring of the debt, which is not an option that Puerto Rico has by virtue of being a territory of the United States. Neither does it have the tools that Detroit has to declare bankruptcy.\n\nThere is a broad coalition of nongovernmental organizations and unions and even the business community that hopes to persuade the federal government that Puerto Rico should have the ability to renegotiate its debt with the Wall Street banks and the hedge funds. Former Governor Anibal Acevedo Vila; Professor José Nicolás Medina, a well-known constitutional attorney; and labor leader Roberto Pagán, one of the top leaders of one of the SEIU affiliate in the island, argue that the federal government has a legal and constitutional obligation to resolve this crisis. The Obama administration has said that it will not intervene. Progressives in the United States must be involved in figuring out what can be done to find a solution to this crisis.\n\nA group led by the Service Employees International Union in New York City and other parts of the mainland in the Puerto Rican communities is rallying some support to pressure the Obama administration. My view is that the administration doesn't have the political will and certainly not the political capital to engage in this fight. This has to become an issue for the presidential election. It's far more important at this point than thinking about solutions to the whole question of the relationship of the island to the United States, which as you know, is a perennial debate in Puerto Rico.\n\n**Gutiérrez**: **In the long term, though, isn't some resolution of the relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico part of the answer to the problems of Puerto Rico? Puerto Rico, with a population of 3.5 million people, has the same federal representation as the District of Columbia, which is to say, none. Puerto Rico, as you mentioned is not a sovereign country, it's subject to federal law, which limits what it can do.**\n\n**La Luz**: No question about it. It would be irresponsible if I didn't say that. It is something that has taken and will take a long time to resolve one way or the other.\n\nMeanwhile, Puerto Ricans no longer migrate to the northeast and Chicago as in the past. The explosive growth of the Puerto Rican vote in central Florida could be the decisive vote in terms of who becomes the next president of the United States. That was certainly the case in 2012 where the percentage of Puerto Ricans in Florida who voted for Obama was 73%. Arguably it was one of the main factors that led to Obama winning Florida in 2012**.** If that happens again and that vote supports a Democratic nominee, it could decide the election. But that vote shouldn't be given for free. It should be part of a commitment to find solutions to the fiscal and economic crisis in the island.\n\n**Gutiérrez**: **I understand that the Fortuño administration, the previous administration, had suspended several collective agreements but then at the end of his term many of those agreements were restored.**\n\n**La Luz**: I was intimately involved. I was dispatched to organize the campaign to restore collective bargaining. In effect, what happened is that Law \\#7, signed in March of 2009, abolished collective bargaining. So we had to get a law enacted to restore bargaining rights and allow us to renegotiate the contracts that had been frozen. Once again, a coalition effort led by unions and allies in the religious community and community organizations fought to restore bargaining rights, and that's why the contracts were renegotiated. But most likely what's going to happen now will be massive layoffs and freezing the contracts because the government has no capacity to pay, and that will be disastrous.\n\n**Gutiérrez**: **Would you say that the Garcia Padilla administration has been better on labor rights than the Fortuño administration?**\n\n**La Luz**: They all have to operate within the confines of the government's ability to pay. The Garcia Padilla administration, despite the fiscal and economic constraints, has abided by the terms of the collective agreements. Even though it hasn't paid the full wage increases that have been negotiated, it has tried for the most part to do so. It has complied with contractual obligations. That may not be an option now, if the finances of the government collapse totally.\n\nThis crisis is so imminent that all progressive forces in the United States and in Puerto Rico have to work together to address this emergency. The Obama administration needs to take action now and it has to become an issue on which candidates for the nomination of the Democratic Party take a position.\n\n**(Sign a petition to end the debt of \\#puertorico** [***https://t.co/MkuGYz0qfh***](https://t.co/MkuGYz0qfh)**)**\n\n*José Gutiérrez is a member of DSA's national political committee, and an executive board member of Metro DC DSA.

Miller","body":"A forum and rally featuring the acerbic and hilarious populist Jim Hightower on Oct. 22 stands out among many Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America activities planned on behalf of the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in October. This event, among many others, is part of the larger Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) [*We Need Bernie*](http://www.dsausa.org/weneedbernie) campaign.\n\nUnlike any other candidate for president, Sanders is refusing to take corporate money to fund his campaign. He's standing behind his values to support working Americans instead of selling out to Wall Street billionaires. As the DSA We Need Bernie campaign website states, \"Senator Sanders will challenge the dominant discourse of neoliberal Democrats that privilege corporate business interests over those of all working people.\" As a result, \"hiscandidacy could help expand both the progressive movement and the democratic socialist voice within that movement.\" Sanders might not be a flawless candidate, and though he has stated that he sympathizes with Democratic Socialism, he doesn't always perfectly align with socialism. But he is a strong voice for socialist value of placing people over profits and his grassroots campaign is a sharp departure from the \"business as usual\" attitude of neoliberal politicians. For these reasons, DSA is supporting his campaign for the Democratic nomination, and the Metro DC chapter is doing its part to raise awareness about Bernie Sanders and his advocacy on behalf of working Americans.\n\nActivities by DC DSA as part of the auxiliary campaign for Bernie Sanders include passing out petitions and flyers and having conversations with people at local farmers markets in the greater DC area. (Feel free to join us on Saturday, Oct. 3 at the U Street Farmers Market on 14th and U, located [*here*](https://www.google.com/maps/place/14th+%26+U+Farmers+Market/@38.9170139,-77.0319646,17z/data=%213m1%214b1%214m2%213m1%211s0x89b7b7e7c2088539:0xc64b640ca9777183), from 9 a.m.-1 p.m.) We'll also be canvassing neighborhoods in the DC metro area throughout the month of October, starting on Columbus Day weekend.\n\nBut the event we're most excited about is a rally featuring Jim Hightower to bring together progressive organizations in DC for Bernie Sanders's campaign. The event will be held on Oct. 22 from 6:30 p.m.-9 p.m. at Busboys and Poets on 5<sup>th</sup> and K St., near the Gallery Place/Convention Center and Mt Vernon Square Metro stops. Among other speakers, *Nickel and Dimed* author Barbara Ehrenreich stands out. Local politician and Busboys and Poets owner Andy Shallal will speak, along with labor leader Larry Cohen. The keynote for the event will be the entertaining and always on-point progressive agitator Jim Hightower. A man of diverse talents and a former Texas agriculture commissioner, Hightower is a radio commentator, author of seven books and syndicated columnist, as well as a rousing speaker who knows how to galvanize the 99 percent to beat out the 1 percent. He's well-known for his newsletter, [**The Hightower Lowdown**](http://www.hightowerlowdown.org/), and his biting wit and clever humor. But under his hilarity lies the serious urgency of taking this country back from the hedge fund managers and Wall Street billionaires for the ordinary, working American families who make up this nation. In his commitment to the grassroots, Hightower is a powerful force to be reckoned with in American culture and a persuasive advocate for Bernie Sanders's campaign.\n\nWe hope to see you at the rally and at many of our other events and activities in support of DSA's auxiliary campaign for Bernie Sanders.

Now teaching environmental law at the University of Vermont Law School, he has recently served as dean of the prestigious Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and has also served as a trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund — presumably a somewhat capitalist enterprise.\n\nYet in his new book \"America the Possible: Manifesto for a New Economy,\" Speth states that the U.S. today faces an \"overwhelming, colliding collection of problems\" that stems from \"fundamental flaws in our economic and political system.\" And while Speth's book lays emphasis on the environmental dimension of those problems, and particularly ourpolitical system's apparent inability to address the problem of climate change, he also stresses the dangers of high and increasing levels of economic inequality, extensive child poverty, and a practice of mass incarceration — particularly of black men — that has given the US the world's largest prison population, both absolutely and as a percentage of the population.\n\nIn addition, \"America the Possible\" notes that the U.S. currently suffers from the highest infant mortality rate in the developed industrial world, the second highest school dropout rate, the highest rate of homicide, and the world's highest rate of spending on wars and the military.\n\nTo cure this daunting list of national maladies, Speth in \"America the Possible\" indicates that environmental groups as well as other progressive forces need to put together a compelling vision of an alternative political and economic future that will break decisively with our \"virulent, fast-growing strain of corporate-consumerist capitalism.\"","order":0},{"title":"The alternate vision will initially seem politically unrealistic to most Americans, Speth acknowledges. Yet as a corporate-dominated American economy and political system suffer from a series of crises in coming decades, the existing system will lose political legitimacy in the eyes of millions of people, and \"progressives of all stripes\" will have a chance to force through systemic change by joining in a unified movement for national transformation, despite \"fierce and determined resistance\"","date":"2012-11-02","issue":"November 2012","author":"supporters of the corporate status quo.","body":"Although praising the civil disobedience practiced by the Occupy movement, Speth in his book and in his talk at the AFL-CIO building in September has not focused on change coming through some kind of insurrection, but through a strategy of interlocking and mutually reinforcing transformations in key features of the existing system, beginning with a coordinated mass effort to democratize the nation's corporate-dominated politics. Transformation also will rest heavily on an ongoing \"bottom-up\" effort to establish new economic institutions at the local level, both as alternatives to corporate economic rule and as models of what a future democratic society might look like.\n\nAccording to \"America the Possible,\" the transformed economy of the future will not be \"classic socialism,\" but at the same time it will not be our existing capitalism, either. From his remarks at the AFL-CIO building and in the pages of the book, Speth seems to favor a highly modified market society combining some features of Swedish social democracy with a \"no growth\" or \"post growth\" economics such as that advocated by Dr. Herman Daly of the University of Maryland and the \"small is beautiful\" economic theories of the late E.F. Schumacher.\n\n\"America the Possible\" also cites Gar Alperovitz, whose book \"America Beyond Capitalism\" envisions corporate capitalism gradually being displaced and supplanted by a spreading market network of cooperatives, worker-owned enterprises, nonprofit businesses, community development programs and \"hybrid\" businesses combining social objectives with the pursuit of profit.\n\nTo combat corporate power at the national and international levels, Speth also recommends a system of \"stakeholder representation\" somewhat resembling the labor co-determination system in Germany that places labor representatives on corporate boards. Another recommendation is that progressives fight to replace the state chartering of large corporations with federal corporate chartering, as recommended by Teddy Roosevelt during the Progressive Era and as recently endorsed by Ralph Nader.\n\nTo address the chronic economic insecurities, widespread poverty and high unemployment rates affecting millions of Americans today, Speth's book calls for a \"new war on poverty,\" although he offers few details on how it might be fought. He also argues for the federal government's serving as \"employer of the last resort\" for the unemployed, possibly through tax incentives to corporations for new hiring but possibly through direct federal employment. Along with radical economist Juliet Schor, he also calls for a less growth-addicted economy in the future to address unemployment through a mixed program of shorter work weeks, increasing government expenditures on unmet social needs and the building of a new culture less devoted to consumerism, less influenced by advertising, and more devoted to leisure time, community, and the quality of life.\n\nFor some democratic socialists, both inside and outside of DSA, particular elements of Speth's economic vision will likely seem problematic. For example, \"America the Possible\" points with alarm to large federal deficits and the growing U.S. national debt. Unlike the Tea Party, Speth clearly wants to reduce the deficits and shrink the debt through cuts in bloated military programs and higher taxes on the rich, and his book advocates an increase in social spending on the poor and economically insecure, not Republican-style austerity.\n\nOn the other hand, despite short and favorable quotations from Keynes and the liberal Keynsian economists Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, \"America the Possible\" seems to rule out Krugman's vision of curing the current business slump through a massive increase in deficit spending. Perhaps equally importantly, Speth's vision of long-term economic transformation through the evolutionary growth of co-ops, worker-owned enterprises and small green businesses — while compatible with Gar Alperovitz's radical vision in \"American Beyond Capitalism\" — is likely to be economic anathema to some pragmatic and business-minded leaders of the labor movement.\n\nWhat democratic socialists should find striking and important in Speth's book and economic vision, however, is the emphasis he puts on mainstream environmental groups moving beyond their focus on \"environmental\" issues alone, and his call — whether or not his ideas can be achieved — for all liberal and progressive movements to join together in supporting one another's issues as they work for system-transforming change.\n\nCosponsoring Speth's speech in September was a coalition of some 15 organizations, not only including the NRDC and some other leading environmental organizations, but also the AFL-CIO itself, Jobs with Justice, and the Labor Network for Sustainability.\n\nOther cosponsors of the event included the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), whose president John Cavanagh introduced Speth;,climate activist Bill McKibben's [*350.org*](http://350.org/); Friends of the Earth – U.S.; the Worldwatch Institute; Yes Magazine; Teaching for Change bookstore; the Center for a New American Dream, the Communitarian Network;and a coalition called the New EconomyWorking Group, which currently works out of IPS.\n\nOther partial endorsers of Speth's vision, judging from the favorableblurbs on the dust cover of \"America the Possible,\" include Alperovitz, environmental writer David Orr, William Greider of The Nation magazine andradical journalist Naomi Klein, author of \"The Shock Doctrine: TheRise of Disaster Capitalism.\"\n\nWhether this range of endorsers indicates thatSpeth's unified progressive movement is already beginning to take shape on a small scale is probably impossible to tell at this stage in American history.\n\nYetfor democratic socialists and other progressives who have deep reservations about the viability of capitalism, andhave long advocated the formation of a multi-issueleftwing movement to replace it, the publication of \"American the Possible\" is a surprisingly hopeful sign.\n\n\"America thePossible: Manifesto for a New Economy\" was publishedthis year by Yale University Press. The list price excluding sales tax is $30, and the bookis availablefrom Teach for Change at Busboys and Poets, as wellas from commercial bookstores such as Kramerbooksat Dupont Circle.","order":1},{"title":"Michael Harrington and \"The Other America\" subject of documentary showing Nov. 8","date":"2012-11-02","issue":"November 2012","author":"","body":"DC DSA joins in the Nov. 8 presentation of a remarkable documentary film, \"Michael Harrington and Today's Other America:Corporate Power and Inequality.\" The film will be shown at **Georgetown University's McNeir Auditorium at 7 p.m.**, with discussion by *Washington Post* columnist and *American Prospect* editor-at-large Harold Meyerson (who is a DSA vice chair) and socialist feminist scholar Heidi Hartmann.\n\nThe course of the debate on poverty and inequality since Harrington's 1962 book *The Other America* caught the attention of Kennedy administration has been rocky. Meyerson, in an *American Prospect* article earlier in 2012, said the \"war on poverty\" was as often in retreat as advancing under a capitalist counterattack, \"a relentlessly destabilizing system that, if not sufficiently checked by democratic popular power, would seek to diminish workers' earnings and influence in its continual quest for profits and control. The New Deal, Harrington believed, could be repealed.\"\n\nThe event is jointly sponsored by Metro DC DSA and Georgetown's Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor, headed by Prof. Joseph McCartin, and by Dissent magazine.\n\n\"It is fitting,\" McCartin told *The Washington Socialist, \"* that we remember Harrington's challenge to America's moral complacency about poverty at this moment, when inequality is soaring. It is appropriate that we recommit ourselves to alleviating the poverty that still afflicts far too many in this nation and around the world.\" The film showing is the first of two programs on poverty planned by the Kalmanovitz Initiative.

The island has more than 3.7 million inhabitants. The capital, San Juan, has more than 395,000 residents .Although Puerto Ricans are US citizens they are also, in cultural and sociological terms a distinct nationality, much like Scots within the United Kingdom or the Basque and Catalans within Spain.\n\nElections were held on Nov. 6 for the the local governor, the island legislature and the municipal governments of Puerto Rico. The incumbent governor, Luis Fortuno, the first Republican to be elected to that position since 1972, lost his re-election campaign. The governor had imposed a neoliberal agenda that was resisted by the people of Puerto Rico and his party will be replaced in office by the more moderate Popular Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe PDP is similar to the Democratic Party of the mainland US but not identical. Like the mainland Democratic Party it has a moderate to conservative wing and a liberal wing. The new governor comes from the moderate wing but the person who is the hope of progressives in Puerto Rico is the woman who will be the mayor of the capital city,Carmen Yulin.\n\nCarmen Yulin, a single mother who was given the best score on civil liberties by the ACLU of any politician in the island, was a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives before running for mayor. She is an advocate of LGBT rights. As a legislator and candidate for mayor she also raised the issue of violence against women.\n\nWith a policy of building alliances with progressives, community activists, unions and politicians from smaller third parties, the Popular Democratic Party candidate, Carmen Yulin, defeated the incumbent mayor and shocked the island establishment.\n\nYulin had to face a strong mayor with a well-established political machine who had been in office for 12 years.\n\nTito Otero, an experienced community organizer and social activist, was in charge of coordinating collaborative agreements with the LGBT community and with community organizers from marginalized, low-income communities and leaders from public housing projects.\n\nYulin also made agreements with the Puerto Rican Workers Union (SPT) and General Union of Workers (UGT). She has stated that she supports the right of city employees to unionize.\n\nYulin also supports the proposals by the Cruz Foundation for a Better Country, an organization that includes social and trade union sectors and advocates environmental causes, education and health.\n\nThe unions had to go to the federal Court of Appeals in Boston to have the right of unions to financially support political candidates in Puerto Rico recognized. The Republican island government had passed two bills, Law 45 and the Campaign Finance Act of 2011, which prohibited union donations to candidates.\n\nMany activists think that Yulin's campaign could have implications beyond San Juan and can project this new way of governing beyond the capitol.","order":3},{"title":"Cinema for Socialists","date":"2012-11-14","issue":"November 2012","author":"Daniel Adkins","body":"***Life over disability: The Sessions* (R, 95 min.) ** Generally a movie about a 38-year old virgin (Mark O'Brian) trying to lose his virginity would more likely be a weak comedy than a drama. Since the script is an autobiography by a UC Berkeley journalist/poet one might think it would be at least well written. You would be right. Finding out that the man involved has a body ravaged by polio so that he can only move his head and can only breath outside his iron lung for a few hours at a time, one wonders how this could possibly be based on actual events. It is. The icing on the cake is that Mark's priest counseled him in this effort. The priest believed Jesus would forgive him for this sin. The film is obviously a drama but Mark O'Brien's sense of humor is so magnificent that you may remember it as a comedy.\n\nThis film should be out shortly. It was bought for distribution at the Sundance Film Festival for $6 million and I have already seen the adverts on TV. For more information Google Mark O'Brian.\n\n***A Royal Affair* (R, 137 min.)**\n\nA Royal Affair (Danish: *En kongelig affære*) is a dramatization of a period of Danish history of the last half of the 18th century. The film roughly parallels the impact of the Enlightenment on the Danish court as a young English princess is wed to become the Danish Queen. Her king is insane or pretends to be insane to deal with a powerful court that has among other things banned all books of the Enlightenment. Into this mix comes a doctor who is secretly a pamphleteer for enlightenment. The king chooses him to be the court's physician since the doctor sees nothing wrong with the king's habit of visiting the red light district. Given this beginning, political intrigue and romance soon follow, but the full story is not always pretty.\n\nProgressive views of history often focus on the role of popular movements. This film shows no such movement but does document how Denmark was held back by a system of serfdom which let the landowners be judge, jury, and executioner of their own serfs. The film also shows the court oblivious to the needs of anything but their own wealth. This 1% relied on the ignorance and powerlessness of the people and a weak king.\n\nThe film was produced with the aid of Denmark, Sweden, and the Czech Republic. The film is beautifully shot and well acted. It has been selected as the Danish entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards. Do check out Danish history and the film in Wikipedia for more information.\n\nFor more info see Wikipedia and [*http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1276419/*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1276419/)","order":4},{"title":"DC Voters Put Ethics First","date":"2012-11-14","issue":"November 2012","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Washington Socialist election extra\n\nDC voters turned out heavily to vote on Nov. 6, many waiting in long lines to cast their ballots, undoubtedly eager to help President Obama win re-election by nailing down the District's critical three electoral votes. It was a good thing they did; otherwise the 91.4 percent of the District's vote that Obama secured could have slipped embarrassingly into the upper 80s.\n\nBut when it came to local races, the ethics of DC officeholders were on the minds of voters as much as more traditional concerns such as public safety, the economy or the effort to win greater independence from congressional oversight. This was not surprising, given that within just the past year two members of the DC Council were convicted of felonies, and other elected officials, including Mayor Vince Gray, have come under investigation for alleged misdeeds.\n\nOn election day, voters overwhelmingly approved three amendments to the DC Charter intended to punish future misbehavior by elected officials, and turned out of office one incumbent – At-Large Councilmember Michael A. Brown – who, while as yet charged with no crime, has been the subject of a spate of negative news reports indicating possible ethical lapses or, at best, a lack of competence. The appeal of David Grosso, who ousted Brown, was less his platform than his newcomer's lack of baggage.\n\nOne of the ballot items would enable a five-sixths vote of the Council to expel a member for \"gross misconduct.\" Today, the only way to remove a sitting councilmember is through a recall election, which in the District's 38-year history of home rule has never happened. The other measures would result in the removal of a mayor or councilmember from office if they committed a felony and bar them from holding the office again. Voters supported the ban-a-felon amendments even though there was confusion – even among the DC councilmembers who proposed them – over whether members would be banned for life or only for the duration of their term, or whether the laws would even hold up in court if challenged.\n\nNevertheless, with the recent convictions of former Council Chair Kwame Brown and former Ward 5 Councilmember Harry Thomas Jr. (Brown on charges related to campaign finance and falsified loan applications, Thomas for stealing DC funds intended for charity), Mayor Gray being investigated for an off-the-books \"shadow\" campaign, and questionable behavior by other officeholders, voters were more than ready to punish what they saw as bad behavior. Michael A. Brown, in particular – who was one of the Council's more progressive members and the most outspoken in support of DC statehood – saw his reputation tarnished by the mysterious disappearance of $113,000 in campaign funds, late payment of taxes and rents, and his role in pushing through a bill to allow online gambling in the District. The gambling bill, which was adopted without a hearing and virtually no public scrutiny, was later repealed.\n\nThe District's enemies in Congress have been quick to pounce on DC officials' ethical lapses, charging – as they have often done in the past – that this proves the District isn't worthy of even the current limited home rule, much less expanded autonomy. Of course, they ignore the more than two decades (following former Mayor Marion Barry's drug arrest in 1990) of virtually scandal-free government in the District – a period when, for instance, it was standard practice for governors of Illinois to head directly to prison after leaving office. Clearly, the desire of some members of Congress to retain firm control over DC is independent of the behavior of the District government – and to deny full democratic rights to 600,000 U.S. citizens because of the misbehavior of a handful of elected officials is un-American in the extreme. Nevertheless, if Congress was waiting for DC voters to express their willingness to ride herd on their officeholders' behavior as a precondition of granting greater autonomy to the District, this election sent that message loudly and clearly.\n\n\\* \\* \\* \\*\n\nOn a happier note, DSA members can be pleased that Phil Mendelson, one of the Council's most progressive and pro-labor members since taking office in 1998, was overwhelmingly elected council chair. Mendelson inherited Kwame Brown's chairmanship on a temporary basis when the latter resigned, and now holds the seat in his own right. The rest of the local races in deep-blue DC involved incumbent Democrats facing no serious opposition.","order":5},{"title":"Horst Brand, 1919–2012","date":"2012-11-02","issue":"November 2012","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Horst Brand, a longtime local DSA member who was a co-founder and editor of *Dissent* and a frequent contributor the magazine, died last August 25 at the age of 92.\n\nAs recently as the 1990s, Brand, a resident of Silver Spring, was an active member of the Metro DC DSA local.

It was a long-awaited moment here in Maryland, where members of the state assembly had considered bills on same-sex marriage for several consecutive years. The bill only passed last year because sponsors accepted a provision requiring a citizens' referendum. Governor Martin O'Malley had made same-sex marriage one of several issues he championed this election season. He helped to raise the millions of dollars equality advocates needed by bringing actor Josh Charles and other celebrities on board as donors and spokespeople.\n\nThe advertising that this fundraising supported enabled, for example, that wonderful TV spot by Julian Bond talking about the same-sex marriage issue as one of civil rights. By contrast, the anti-equality forces' publicity looked thin and outdated. I am reminded of walking from my car to the polling place on the morning of Nov. 6 and being accosted by a middle aged woman offering me a flyer and saying \"Please consider voting no on Question 6\" I looked at her and said, \"I'm a lesbian in a 28-year relationship – why should I?\" She was startled and didn't have an answer. In the end, I think those who opposed the law had no real grounds and, like the woman who accosted me, no real answers to offset the logical reasons that equality advocates had so carefully advanced.\n\nIn passing the same-sex marriage referendum, Maryland answers democratic socialists' call for sexual and gender equality. The law provides a structural intervention in a legal system that has long had barriers to gay and lesbian citizens' enjoying as full benefits as heterosexuals under the law. As states systematically pass same-sex marriage laws – there are 10 now, with Minnesota expected to follow with a prohibition lifted on Nov. 6 – it becomes a real possibility that something could be done at the national level in the coming years.\n\n**\"Dream Act\" approved** Marylanders also passed this state's version of the \"Dream Act,\" giving many children of undocumented workers the right to in-state tuition rates at the state's higher-education institutions. As the *Baltimore Sun* reports, it \"goes into effect Dec. 6 \\[and\\] enables students who were brought to this country as children to pay in-state tuition rates if they have attended at least three years of high school in state and can show that they or their parents have paid state taxes during that time. Students must complete 60 credits at a state community college before they can apply to pay in-state tuition at a four-year institution.\" A cohort of mostly working-class striversnow has lower-cost access to education and skills. Public and private entities should be under more pressure than ever to come up with the jobs to match. These young people are not the only ones who will benefit from this new law. The larger communities and nation benefit by having an educated population.\n\n**Gambling measure wins** Meanwhile, democratic socialists have less to cheer about on some of the other Maryland referendums. In spite of an excellent \"Anti Question 7\" campaign, voters approved the expansion of gambling in Maryland. Among the provisions in this measure is an extension of the number of gambling venues from six to seven, expanded hours of operation for casinos to 24/7, and huge tax breaks for casino owners for years to come. This measure was championed by Governor O'Malley and Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker as a way to fund public education. In fact, there is nothing in the law that requires proceeds to go to schools. Instead, in all likelihood, the casino business will rake in billions for the billionaires. With a \"pro-local development\" argument, Baker had worked hard since his election to office two years ago to interest out-of-state casino owners who are expected to place a major Las Vegas style casino complex at National Harbor in Prince George's County. These casino magnates are also expected to use out-of-state contractors to construct the facilities. This point was one often lost in the debates prior to the election, with the focus more often on the school revenues issues. The fact that construction unions strongly backed the gambling plan while the county's contractors' association opposed it illustrates the bewildering mix of interests in this elaborate scenario. Also lost was the fact that some of the same casino magnates planning to locate at National Harbor were cited by the New Jersey Gaming Enforcement Commission as having ties to organized crime in Macau, a \"special administrative district\" (along with Hong Kong) of the People's Republic of China. A May 2009 special report authored by Assistant Attorney General Josh Lichtblau noted that MGM had made Pansy Ho a partner in a proposed venture in New Jersey when, in fact, Pansy Ho was under the influence of her father Stanley Ho, who permitted \"organized crime to operate and thrive within his casinos.\" The Attorney General's office recommended that \"MGM be directed to disengage itself from direct or indirect business or financial associations with Pansy Ho, or her related entities.\" All this is to say that organized crime is likely to follow the expanded casino business soon to become a feature of National Harbor.\n\n**Gerrymandered districts left intact **Another downside in the election returns was approval of a Maryland redistricting map that had been redrawn last year by an O'Malley-appointed commission. States are required to revise their federal legislative districts every 10 years in light of changing population and demographics. The newly drawn map truly boggles even the dullest imagination, with legislative districts snaking in and around (and across) county lines all over the state.\n\nA Nov. 9 *Baltimore Sun* editorial called the Question 5 referendum's results on congressional redistricting in Maryland \"a disgrace\" and a \"badge of shame for the state.\" The *Sun* noted that \"It would be hard to imagine a clearer case of politicians choosing their voters, rather than the other way around\" and said it undermines the fundamental purpose of the election process. The wording of the referendum question \"seemed intended to mislead,\" it said, since the language indicated the measure was meant to endorse bona fide boundaries of the state's congressional districts rather than the product of a gerrymandering process (which it actually was). Editorial writers concluded: \"If John Sarbanes' 3<sup>rd</sup> District map were superimposed on a 20-year-old map of South Africa, a reasonable observer would take for granted that such a political alignment was intended to undermine the political rights of the unfortunates collected there.\"\n\nThe underlying racial tensions underlying the federal (congressional) redistricting process are also at work at the legislative level in Maryland. Last year, a similar gerrymandering process took place when legislative districts were redrawn by a commission appointed by Governor O'Malley. The state-level redistricting has been targeted as a civil rights issue by the Fannie Lou Hamer Political Action Committee, composed of civil rights attorneys and activists. On Nov. 9, a Maryland Court of Appeals heard arguments in the case in which the FLH-PAC is arguing that although the reapportionment falls within the required 10 per cent population deviation between the largest and smallest district, the map violates the \"one person, one vote\" provision in the U.S. Constitution. Opponents say that the map overpopulates districts in rural areas of the state, while urban and suburban districts are underpopulated, with the effect of giving undue advantage to white elected officials trying to retain their seats and preventing minority candidates from fairly challenging them.","order":7},{"title":"Notes on a near-death experience: the Democrats and Obama in 2012","date":"2012-11-14","issue":"November 2012","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"Washington Socialist election extra\n\nFor U.S. progressives, the 2012 presidential election results offer some wonderfully positive and some truly terrible news, all at the same time. The very good news is that on Nov. 6, a little more than half thecountry's voters rejected a vaguely worded and essentially elitistRepublican plan to revive astagnant American economy through a mix of deregulation and massive tax cuts thatinevitably would have been targeted at the very rich.\n\nAlong with repudiating the Romney-Ryan tax plan,a thin majority of the electorate proved resistant to both implicit and some highly explicitconservative appeals to racist, misogynist, anti-gay, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiments that have recently won alamentably large fraction of white working class men to a Republican vision that does not serve their economic interests.\n\nDespite covert and overt conservative appeals to racist fantasies about Obama's alleged birth in Kenya, his alleged belief in radical Islam, and his alleged ties toCommunism and terrorist, a majority of Americans who participated in the election made history by reelecting Barack Hussein Obama, the nation's first nonwhite President. And in doing so, the winning majority for Obama proved that whatever deeply conflicted feelings Americans still have about race and religion, the nation appears to be at least moving (glacially?) in the direction of a more tolerant and inclusive society.\n\nThat's the good news. One piece of really awful news, of course, is that nearly 50 percent of U.S. voters chose on Nov. 6 to vote just the opposite way — in favor of the Romney/Ryan tax plan and perhaps in favor of racism, homophobia,religious bigotry, misogyny and rightwing conspiracy fantasies to some degree.\n\nFor many members of the Metro DC chapter of DSA, Obama's narrow election victory and Romney's narrow election defeat undoubtedly brought a surge of emotional relef — in my case, anyway, Iwas surprised to find that the relief bordered on elation, onceall the election results were in. But — why was the victory so narrow?\n\nDemocratic socialists, at least in DSA, are a fractious lot, and I doubt any analysis of the elections will win agreement from everyone in the chapter or in DSA nationwide. But it seems clear to me that Obama won such a small majority because Romney's team, both in the presidential debates and on the campaign trail, was basically right about thepainful and disgraceful shape of the U.S. economy, some four years after the catastrophic financial failures of 2008.\n\nObviously, the Republican leadership in Congress since the start of Obama's first term has done almost everything it could to sabotage efforts by the White House and the congressional Democrats to promote economic recovery. Obviously, Mitt Romney's GOP colleagues in the House and the Senate share a huge amount of blame for the extensive poverty and high unemployment that Romney complained about on the campaign trail, a fact that made Romney's sanctimonious promises of a \"bipartisan\" governing style somorally repellent when he made them in the debates.\n\nYet however malevolent the congressional Republicans have been in trying to block economic recovery under Obama, the harsh truth is that the White House and the Congressional Democrats have notdone anything resembling an adequate job of trying to promote job growth, or effective government regulation of the financial industry, or relief for millions of Americans who have either lost their homes to foreclosure or face the risk of losing their homes to foreclosure because of the unresolved mortgage crisis.\n\nIn other words, Obama and the mainstream of theDemocratic Partyalso deserve some of the blame for the high unemployment rates and extensive poverty thatplague the United States in 2012, as some democratic socialists and other progressive economists have been saying for months now.It's an irony of history that during the 2012election campaign, it took a millionaire Republican vulture capitalist with a Cayman Islands bank account to persuade many voters of this \"socialist\" truth, but it is a socialist truth.\n\nEven given the level of GOP bad faiththat they'vefaced, why have Obama and the Democrats been so inadequate since 2008 in fighting poverty, reducing unemployment and rescuing embattled homeowners from an unfair foreclosure crisis?\n\nAs TIME magazine reporter Michael Grunwald observes in his book *The New New Deal,* a generally laudatory account of the Obama economic stimulus program of 2009, the Obama economic team in late 2008 and early 2009 deliberately chose to propose a stimulus plan that their ownanalysis suggested was only about half as big as needed tooffset the steep reductions in consumer demand associated with the2008 financial crash.\n\nAgainst the advice of liberalKeynsian economists like Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz,Grunwaldreports, the Obama economic advisors — Larry Summers, Rahm Emanuel and others — decided to propose an economic stimulus ofno more than $1 trillion, partly on the grounds that it was politically unrealistic to expect Congress to approve anything bigger.\n\nDSA founder Michael Harrington, in one of his books, once called this kind of thinking \"crackpot realism,\" representing \"realism\" about perceived political attitudes of the day along with a crackpot, utterly unrealistic sense of what may be needed to solve actual social and economic problems. And the Obama team promoted exactly such a \"crackpot realism\" approach to economic stimulus in 2009, partly in hopes that it could be amended later, given enough Republican goodwill — but that good will, of course, never materialized.\n\nIn addition to designing an inadequately sized stimulus, Grunwald reports in \"The New New Deal,\" the Obama economic team also decided against focusing the stimulus on economic assistance to financially embattled state and local governments.\n\nThis turns out to have been a near-fatal mistake, for much of the high unemployment of the past two years has been driven by massive layoffs of public employees by state and local governments. However, Grunwald characterizesthe Obama team as reasoning that even many congressional Democrats would have little interest in helping the states and cities financially, for in many cases these units of governmentwere led by Republican governors and mayors who had won office by demonizing Democrats and by promising wholly unrealistic tax breaks to the voters.\n\nThe Obama team evidently felt that the Democrats on Capitol Hill would be content to let the responsible Republican leaders suffer from their own folly — but unfortunately, a side effect of this neglect was that thousands of teachers, police officers, fire fighters, social workers and the like lost their jobs as the states and localities spiraled into fiscal crisis. Moreover, the Obama team made the pain worse by making additional cuts in the 2009 stimulus plan to get the votes of Maine Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe.\n\nSo was Mitt Romney, whatever his other faults, partly correct in blaming the Democrats and Obama for high unemployment in 2009? Yes, he was, for the Obama team's punting on the size of the stimulus and its inability or unwillingness to provide adequate financial help to the states and cities made high job losses inevitable.\n\nThe bad news about the economic failures of the Obama team and the mainstream Democratic Party leadership don't stop there, however.","order":8},{"title":"The respected financial journalist Charles Ferguson, director of the award-winning film \"Inside Job,\" reports in his new book ","date":"2012-11-02","issue":"November 2012","author":"now for financial fraud.","body":"And as long-time DSA activist Bill Barclay, a member of the Chicago Political Economy Group (CPEG), pointed out in a recent \"GET UP\" training on economics for political activists here in the D.C. area, there have been literally trillions of dollars in financial help that the federal government has provided to troubled banks, under both the Bush and the Obama administrations, while pitifully small sums of money have gone to rescuing millions of American homeowners with \"underwater\" mortgages.\n\nFinally there is the question of \"free trade\" and corporate governance. As Roger Bybee points out in the latest issue of the leftist economic journal*Dollars & Sense*, the Obama campaign in 2012 appealed to embattled US workers partly by portraying Romney as a heartless vulture capitalist whose leadership of Bain Capital resulted in the outsourcing of American jobs to low-wage Asian countries such as China.\n\nYet as Bybee notes in \"Obama's Double Game on Outsourcing: Ripping Romney While Pushing Free Trade,\" the Obama White House has successfully pushed through three new free trade treaties — with South Korea, Panamaand Columbia, respectively — that\"foster the shift of production from the United States to low-wage offshore sites—often in authoritarian nations denying basic labor rights.\"\n\nRobert Scott of theEconomic Policy Institute (EPI) has predicted that\"the South Korea deal alone will cost 159,000 U.S. workers their jobs,\" Bybee reports in *Dollars & Sense*.\n\nWorse still may be to come, for the Obama White House appears to be working behind closed doors with representatives of corporate America to enact an even more far-reaching, more anti-labor and anti-consumer treaty, the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership or TPP, that would give unelected tribunals of corporate representatives new powers to kill \"protective regulations on finance, the environment, workplace safety, and other vital measures enacted by democratically elected governments.\"\n\nHow should democratic socialists and other US progressives respond to the pattern of Democratic Party pandering to popular Republican prejudices and elite corporate interests that the above facts suggest?\n\nIn recent internet exchanges by DSA activists at the national level, many leading progressives have argued that our first priority must be to head off new \"bipartisan\" attacks on Social Security, Medicare and other social spending programs as President Obama and the House Republicans engaged in new talks about how to avert the \"fiscal cliff\" now under discussion in the mainstream press. Progressive activists from many different constituencies have a common interest in blocking joint Republican and Democraticefforts to avoid the \"fiscal cliff\" by slashing spending on the poor, the near poor and the mainstream middle class, leading DSA thinkers are suggesting.\n\nEfforts to meet the immediate crisis posed by the \"fiscal cliff\" issue should not distract democratic socialists and other progressives from a larger problem, though.\n\nAs Charles Ferguson argues in *Predator Nation,* and as political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson have documented in *Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer — and Turned Its Back on the Middle Class*, the reality is that the Democratic Party has partly been captured by the same wealthy campaign donors and the same set of powerful corporations that today virtually monopolize economic thinking in GOP circles.\n\nIn the ongoing campaign by the wealthiest \"1 percent\" to keep control over the US government,Hacker and Pierson have noted, the Republican Party today is playing the role of a classic Hollywood villain — but the Democratic Party, for all its pretenses to the contrary, is far from being a champion of the people. The \"near-death\" experience of the Obama campaign and the Democratic mainstream in 2012 should be a reminder to all serious progressives that the US left needs to devise some effective way of capturing control over the Democratic Party for the benefit of the working class — or, alternatively, finding some other way of battling against both Republican economic elitism and its Democratic shadow.\n\nIf this analysis seems like treason to Democratic Party loyalists, let's remember just how close the President and the party came to losing everything in this year's election — at least partly over economic reasons.\n\nIf the Democrats and the Obama White House don't improve their economic performance, and if the Republicans next time choose a candidate who is not a flip-flopping millionaire vulture capitalist with a bank account in the Cayman Islands, who's to say that the GOP won't take the White House next time?","order":9},{"title":"Senate Outcome Boosts Progressive Prospects","date":"2012-11-02","issue":"November 2012","author":"Jose Gutierrez","body":"Washington Socialist election extra\n\nDemocrats have maintained control of the Senate. A few months ago, people would have found this to be a surprising result. In many ways the results of the Senate election are more impressive than those of the Presidential race.\n\nMore surprising and more significant to us on the left, the new Senate will be more progressive than the former one.\n\nChris Murphy in Connecticut is replacing Joe Lieberman — the same Lieberman who was a cheerleader for the Iraq war, and who endorsed John McCain in 2008. Jim Webb is being replaced by the more progressive Tim Kaine in Virginia. Also, the conservative states of Indiana and Missouri have both elected moderates that are substantially to the left of their rivals. Perversely, we can thank the Tea Party sensibility and its over-the-top social issues rhetoric for this turn of events.\n\nThere will be 20 women in the next Senate, a record. One of the biggest upsets came in North Dakota where Democrat Heidi Heitkamp defeated Rick Berg. In Hawaii, Daniel Akaka is being replaced by Mazie Hirono, one of the most liberal members of the House. She will be the first Asian-American woman in the Senate. Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, the first openly gay Senator, will replace Herb Kohl. Elizabeth Warren, a staunch progressive will be the next senator from Massachusetts, replacing Republican Scott Brown.\n\nMany of the new Senators are committed to reforming the filibuster, which has been used by Republicans to stop progressive reform. The significance of real filibuster reform can't be underestimated. If it weren't for the filibuster, a cap and trade scheme would have been approved in the previous Senate. It is also possible that a jobs program could have been passed soon after the health care reform bill was approved by the Senate in 2010. The likelihood of reform of existing labor law would have been much greater.\n\nIf any of the justices of the Supreme Court step down, the composition of the new Senate could be decisive. More liberal justices in the Supreme Courtmight lead to the reversal of decisions such as Citizens United.\n\nThe left will also have a better shot at stopping any \"grand bargain\" that makes regressive cuts to Social Security and Medicare.

That's a pretty broad question so let's tackle the question of the DSA's core philosophy first. The best source document for DSA's core philosophy is [**Where we Stand**](http://www.dsausa.org/about/where.html) although as noted in that document \"Since DSA is a pluralist organization, no single document can adequately and equally reflect our diverse perspectives.\" However the document goes on to establish some universal values that match my personal experience in talking to members. Probably the most concise description is:\n\nWe are socialists because we share a vision of a humane international social order based both on democratic planning and market mechanisms to achieve equitable distribution of resources, meaningful work, a healthy environment, sustainable growth, gender and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships.\n\nThat is probably the most concise description of the DSA's core philosophy. We know that every person deserves the dignity of a good job, safe housing, quality education, decent healthcare and, most importantly, the right to a say in how these things are distributed.\n\nOur vision of socialism is a profoundly democratic one, rooted in the belief that individuals can only reach their full potential in a society that embodies the values of liberty, equality, and solidarity. Only through creating material and cultural bonds of solidarity across racial, gender, age, national, and class lines can true equality of opportunity be achieved.\n\nSo how do we apply these principles to our everyday lives? As they say, the devil is in the details. There appears to be a significant difference of opinion on this from person to person even within the DSA and it is perhaps something that we need to discuss more. I'm not familiar with any practical guide to living like a socialist, so I'm going to draw heavily from my personal experience and thoughts on the matter. I will start with one of the least controversial – how we interact daily with the people around us.\n\nIn terms of our relationships with other people, it's important to think about that most important socialist concept: solidarity. What is solidarity? There is a sociological, technical definition, but for socialists, it's the idea that all of humanity is a family, so we have similar responsibilities to someone in Asia or Africa as we would to someone in our personal circle of friends and family. Another way of stating this is that we are all in this together, an injury to one is an injury to all or that actions taken on one side of the world have tangible repercussions for those living on the other. This is perhaps more true now then it has ever been in human history.\n\nNow does this mean we should go up to strangers in the streets and hug them? Most people probably are not ready for that. But it does mean that we should treat those around us with the same respect and dignity we all crave, regardless of truly trivial and arbitrarily determined things such as race, gender and class. This is not to say that differences do not exist, for they surely do, but if we want to reconcile those differences or work together towards goals critical to us all we need to think about what we have in common, which is a great deal.\n\nIn practical terms this may be as simple as being polite to the other sufferers of the morning commute, realizing that they are going though the same struggle as you. It may mean talking to the janitor(s) at work and learning about their struggles, maybe even offering your assistance or being honest with your coworkers about how much you make. Small steps such as these may seem trivial at first, but they can lead to big changes. If you can, talk to your coworkers about their grievances and consider forming a union. This is a big and somewhat risky step, but the rewards are tremendous. When we refuse to conform to a system, even in a small way, we are fighting that system which relies on our compliance. Capitalist society often discourages this sort of behavior, because a divided family cannot work together. It pits us against each other when we should be working together.\n\nThis is no less true in the household. This is of course a deeply personal matter, but it's important to remember that ties – blood, religious, hormonal or otherwise – do not negate human rights. The historical family unit has not been one of mutual respect and although it predates capitalism, it is a division that capitalists have exploited. However, you don't have to arrange your family in the traditional patriarchal way. If partners work together for common goals and seek to ensure each other's success while respecting each other's rights to self determination the outcome is more likely to be positive (of course nothing is assured).\n\nChildren are not something I have experience with so I would not presume to be an expert on raising a child as a socialist, but, here are some thoughts. The most important skill you can teach your children is how to think for themselves and question everything around them. Not only is this important to having a good, healthy social discourse and allowing them to participate in a democratic society, but it is also a critical survival skill in a deregulated marketplace. The other thing I would say is that it's essential to be engaged as a parent, particularly when your children are young i.e. Preschool-Kindergarten. There is a wealth of science to back this up, but it appears that this is when a great deal of essential soft skills are learned that are very difficult to learn later in life.\n\nYour finances are a place where it is easy to be a socialist. One of the most important things you can do is move your money to a credit union. A credit union is a great example of democratic socialist organization. A credit union is a member-owned financial cooperative, democratically controlled by its members, and operated for the purpose of promoting thrift, providing credit at competitive rates, and providing other financial services to its members. Many credit unions also provide services intended to support community development or sustainable international development on a local level, and could be considered community development financial institutions. This takes your money out of the hands of international banks and back into your community. While there are restrictions in the US that limit the ability of credit unions to completely take the place of private banks, if enough people took their money out of banks and put it into credit unions this could change. As an added bonus, depositors usually get higher interest rates then they do at banks.\n\nI could go on a great deal about what to do as a socialist in your everyday life. I have not even touched on subjects such as consumption and the environment, and I could go into much more depth on any of the subjects covered, like finance. I have tried to touch on some practical things that anyone can work on. Before I finish, I want to say two more things. First, one of the most important things you can do as a socialist is be an advocate for change. Volunteer your time and/or resources to protect others and yourself from social injustices. Second, nobody is perfect and you're going to make mistakes; that is OK, just make sure you learn from them. I hope this is a beginning to the answer of how to live like a socialist.","order":11},{"title":"That Emerging Majority","date":"2012-11-14","issue":"November 2012","author":"Jose Gutierrez","body":"Washington Socialist election extra\n\nTen years ago John Judis and Ruy Texeira wrote a book called *The Emerging Democratic Majority* in which they argued that demographic changes would lead to a Democratic electoral majority. The timing of their book couldn't have been worse. Months after the book, came out Republicans made gains in the 2002 midterm elections and then in 2004 Bush was reelected.\n\nThe election of November 6th seems to have proved, 10 years later, some of the points made in the book.\n\nThe writers argued that even though the George McGovern campaign had been defeated by a huge margin in the 1972 election it had over–performed among certain groups: minorities, working and single women, the college educated and skilled professionals — and that those groups would represent a majority of the electorate in the future.\n\nMinority voters went from being 26% in 2008 to 28% in 2012. This proved to be an unpleasant surprise to the Romney campaign. They had expected the minority vote to remain at the same level and had hoped to mobilize enough white voters through subtle and sometimes not so subtle cues appealing to racial resentment to win the election.\n\nIn both 2008 and 2012, 80% of minority voters voted for Obama. Obama actually did better among Hispanics in 2012 (71-27) than he did in 2008 (67-31).\n\nIn Florida he won 60% of the Hispanic vote, partly due to an increase in the Puerto Rican population of the state, which traditionally votes Democratic. According to some polls he might have won has much as 50% of the Cuban vote in Florida. If true, this would be the highest percentage won by a Democrat among an ethnic group that has voted Republican in the past.\n\nObama's support among Asian-Americans went from 62-35 to 73-26.\n\nObama won a substantial majority among women, in particular single women, among those with a postgraduate education, and among young voters. In fact, the number of younger voters went up from 2008.\n\nObama won more than 70% of the LGBT vote.\n\nHowever, democratic socialists can't count on the inexorable march of demographics to make the country more progressive for two reasons. One is a long-term reason, the other is more immediate.\n\nRacial identity is a very flexible and shifting concept and groups that are marginalized today will not be tomorrow. Hispanics and Asian-Americans have high rates of intermarriage. It is very likely that the ethnic identity of today's minorities will weaken and that they will move from supporting the Democrats to supporting Republicans much as did Italian Americans and Irish Americans.\n\nToday's Republican Party is exclusionary and xenophobic but tomorrow's conservatives will have to adapt to the new America.\n\nThe other much more immediate reason and more obvious to us democratic socialists and to other left activists is that much of the Democratic Party is committed to neoliberalism. We could end up with a country that is more racially tolerant, with more symbolic if not real gender equality – but one assimilated to the neoliberal consensus that persistent structural inequality is just the economic facts of life.\n\nPart of the broad project of the left has to be to rally as much support among the elements of this potential majority as possible to push the country towards social democracy before this opportunity slips from our fingers.","order":12},{"title":"A Corporate Tammany Hall on the Potomac: The Scandal of the Exelon Deal, and How PEPCO's Influence Peddling Made It Possible","date":"2016-03-31","issue":"April 2016","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"On March 23, the DC Public Service Commission betrayed the DC public interest. By a 2-1 vote, with PSC chair Betty Ann Kane dissenting, the commission at last approved the enormously controversial offer by the Chicago-based nuclear utility giant Exelon to buy control over our local electricity utility PEPCO.\n\nAs the *Washington Socialist* reported last year, local consumer advocates and renewable energy activists have been warning the PSC and the media for two years or more that this merger will harm the average PEPCO ratepayer in a host of interesting ways while likely frustrating the DC Government's alleged interest in promoting solar rooftop and windmill-generated electricity in the District, thus setting back the city's efforts to develop a more sustainable energy base.\n\nThis makes the PSC's ruling difficult to explain, especially since the Commission had issued a unanimous rejection of a previous Exelon offer only last August. Moreover, DC's Mayor Muriel Bowser, who also had opposed the original Exelon offer, only to reverse course later in the fall when Exelon and PEPCO submitted an alternative plan that included some $78 million in rather short-term benefits for residential ratepayers, by March 23 had changed course once again. By the time the Commission finally announced its approval of Exelon's third and latest offer, the Bowser administration was urging its rejection.\n\nDespite its own initial ruling of last August, despite its rejection of Exelon's second takeover proposal early this year, and despite the renewed opposition of the Mayor, the DC Office of People's Counsel and the DC Attorney General's Office, the PSC on March 23 surprised many local observers and chose to accept one of Exelon's three newest takeover options.\n\nAs a result, attorneys for Exelon and PEPCO have already merged the management structures of the two companies, and most observers think the long-delayed takeover is now an accomplished fact. True: at press time, a local renewable energy activist group called Grid 2.0 had submitted a new objection to the takeover, but most critics think it will become final by the end of May.\n\nWhy did the PSC finally change its mind? Given its unanimous rejection of the original Exelon offer and its 2-1 rejection of the second offer submitted last fall, why did the Commission reverse itself last week, and accept a very similar plan to the original one, especially when even the Mayor had come out against it?\n\nLocal utility industry watcher and environmental analyst Marchant Wentworth, in an interview with the *Socialist* just before press time, said the shifting stance of the Apartment and Office Building Association of Greater Washington (AOBA) was one operative factor in the PSC's flip-flop.\n\nFor some years now, Wentworth noted, apartment building owners and certain other local businesses, who have a low elasticity of demand for electricity, have been required to pay higher electricity prices in order to provide somewhat lower prices for residential customers. The commercial building owners natural resented this subsidy to residential ratepayers, and they were not pleased when Exelon, in order to sweeten its original merger proposal, agreed to make $78 million available to the Mayor's Office for redistribution to such ratepayers to buffer them against the next few years of rate increases, while providing little or no such protection to the apartment industry.\n\nHowever, when the PSC rejected the second Exelon proposal with the $78 million sweetener, and when Exelon responded by then submitting a list of three possible alternatives to it, one of the three new options called for the PSC rather than the Mayor's Office to control the $78 million buffer fund. This opens the possibility that the commercial owners may see some of the subsidy money, instead of all it going to residential power users. Given an AOBA press release from last fall, it also appears that the PSC may now considering changing its rate structures over a series of rate cases unfolding in time, to provide relief to commercial building owners – at the likely expense of other customers, it appears.\n\nThe apartment building owners therefore reversed their opposition to the deal and declared in favor of the option that the PSC ultimately approved. Of course the PSC, too, had reason to like the idea of getting to hold the $78 million instead of the Mayor controlling it. On the other hand, the Mayor's Office lost a bit of turf under the deal, and this may be why Mayor Bowser, the Office of People's Counsel and Attorney General Karl Racine all opposed what the Commission ended up accepting.\n\nYet the biggest winners from the apparently completed merger, Wentworth said, are PEPCO's shareholders, who collectively will gain \"billions of dollars\" from Exelon buying up their PEPCO stock at a premium price well above its market value. PEPCO shareholders and executives thus have the greatest interest in what the PSC approved, and that's why PEPCO's wide-ranging web of political influence in the District is likely a key important factor in the outcome.\n\nAs local and national media have noted, PEPCO in recent years has donated some $1.6 million annually in contributions to a wide range of local charities and civic organizations. Through its hiring practices and apprenticeship programs, the company also can offer attractive career opportunities to an admittedly rather limited circle of minority youth in need of such opportunities. PEPCO also has been relatively progressive in racial matters over the past several decades, hiring and promoting black executives to relatively high positions.\n\nAccordingly, when Exelon and PEPCO first proposed to merge a few years ago, PEPCO, its shareholders and its executives already had established a formidable web of local political contacts who would support the proposed deal, regardless of what common sense and hundreds of pages of expert testimony might say against it.\n\nFor example, as the trade publication *RTO Insider* reported back in October, and as the *Post* has reported as well, a former senior vice president and special advisor to the CEO of PEPCO Holdings, Inc., (PHI), Beverly Perry, has recently served as a senior adviser to Mayor Bowser. For his part, DC Attorney General Karl Racine is a lawyer who in his former corporate practice did work for PEPCO, and Phil Mendelsohn, the generally respected chair of the DC Council, owns enough PEPCO stock that he has been officially required to report it. DC Council member Vincent Orange is a former regional vice president of PHI.\n\nWithin the local corporate and nonprofit world, meanwhile, the CEO of PEPCO Energy Services, John Huffman, as of last fall sat of the board of the Capital Area Food Bank; a retired PEPCO executive, Linda Jo Smith, is listed as board chair of the DC anti-hunger group So Others Might Eat, or SOME.\n\nA little web research indicates that yet another PEPCO vice president, Marc Battle, sits on the board of the local art and music group Step Afrika! David Velasquez, former executive vice president of PHI and now the head of PEPCO operations under Exelon, appears to be serving on the boards of the Smithsonian Institution's National Zoo, the Greater Washington Board of Trade and the Trust for the National Mall, among other entities.\n\nThe retiring CEO of PHI, Joseph Rigby, who is stepping down following the merger, has until recently been a board member of the Federal City Council, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Greater Washington Board of Trade and the Greater Washington Sports Alliance. And according to PEPCO's own web site, the company in 2013 was \"partners\" with, and evidently a contributor to, dozens of DC, Maryland and national nonprofit groups, including:\n\n-   The Children's Defense Fund\n\n-   The Congressional Black Caucus\n\n-   The Cystic Fibrosis Association\n\n-   The D.C. Boys Choir\n\n-   C. Central Kitchen\n\n-   The D.C. Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy\n\n-   Emmaus Council for the Aging\n\n-   The Jewish Council for the Aging\n\n-   The Latin American Youth Center\n\n-   The Glover Park Citizens Association\n\n-   The Greater Washington Hispanic Chamber of Commerce\n\n-   Holy Cross Hospital Foundation\n\n-   The House of Ruth, a D.C. shelter for battered women and children escaping from domestic violence\n\n-   Mission of Love Charities, Inc.\n\n-   The National NAACP and the NAACP of Montgomery County\n\n-   The Spina Bifida Association\n\n-   Teach for America – DC Region\n\n-   Society for Ecological Restoration\n\n-   Special Olympics – District of Columbia\n\n-   The Nature Conservancy – Maryland/DC\n\n-   Washington Nationals Youth Baseball\n\n-   Studio Theater\n\n-   The Phillips Collection\n\n-   University of the District of Columbia\n\n-   George Washington University\n\nThe anti-hunger and anti-homelessness organization Thrive DC, and numerous other local and national organizations.\n\nWhen Exelon and PEPCO brought their case for the takeover before the PSC, the Mayor's Office and the local print and broadcast media, therefore, they had the backing of many local business groups that get financial benefits from doing business with PEPCO, as well as the Board of Trade and the Federal City Council, now headed by former DC Mayor Anthony Williams. They also boasted of having the endorsement of nearly four dozen nonprofit groups, whose representatives in some cases testified before the PSC that the proposed merger was clearly in the public interest – even though the ratepayers of Baltimore, where Exelon recently took control of the former local utility Baltimore Gas & Electric, have endured five rate hikes in two years since that merger was consummated.\n\nNo one can say for sure just how much sway PEPCO's \"partners\" – or more properly speaking, its charitable clients – had in persuading two of the PSC's initially skeptical commissioners to change their minds on the merger. But it's a fairly safe bet that the clamor from PEPCO-beholden nonprofits, along with pressure from the Board of Trade and the Apartment Building Owners Association, didn't do any damage to PEPCO's cause.\n\nObviously, the use of money to buy political influence has become all too common in our society, but there's one aspect of PEPCO's political strategy in the takeover proceedings that seems unusually outrageous, even by ordinary American standards.\n\nPEPCO – to the extent it still exists as an organization – is a regulated utility because it's a natural monopoly, and therefore enjoys a special status under law. It controls all or virtually all distribution of electricity in the District and other parts of its service area, encompassing an estimated 2 million customers here and in certain parts of Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, because of the physical absurdity of having rival power companies attempt to string competing networks of power line wires and electrical transformers over the area.\n\nAs a legally tolerated and regulated monopoly, PEPCO can essentially force almost everyone in its service area to pay for its electricity distribution, whether we choose to or not. And by using a small fraction of the enormous revenues it receives from us to buy influence with dozens, if not hundreds of local businesses and charitable and civic organizations, PEPCO has devised a way to use a fraction of the money we pay to it to thwart the voices of genuine consumer advocates before the PSC, not to mention in the commercial media. Most outrageously, PEPCO seems to be using its contributions to perpetually underfunded and needy anti-hunger and anti-poverty organizations and churches in order to get them to support a bad merger that's likely to impose additional economic burdens on their clients.\n\nFrom one angle, PEPCO's use of its remarkable influence web illustrates what Marxist economics says about the effects of \"alienation\" in the capitalist workplace and marketplace, where corporations can earn profits by overcharging their customers and exploiting their workers, then employ those profits to build larger economic and political structures to make these customers and workers even more powerless than we found ourselves originally.\n\nIn terms of mainstream American political thinking, though, it's probably better to reflect on the ways that PEPCO's influence buying in today's Washington resembles the mechanisms that big city political machines like New York City's notorious Tammany Hall used to profit from their political influence during the Gilded Age of the late nineteenth century. Under the rule of Tammany Hall in particular, and under the dominion of many similar urban political machines of its era, relatively poor and powerless city residents – in the case of Tammany's New York, poor Irish immigrants only recently arrived from the Old Country – could obtain very real and important short-term benefits from machine rule.\n\nIf a poor Irish family in New York was too broke to afford a decent Christmas dinner, say, or if a son or nephew in the family was jobless and needed paid work with the police force or the city water department or some other city agency, they could often call on the local Tammany precinct worker or \"ward heeler\" for aid. The precinct worker by working through the machine might then provide the needed Christmas dinner, or arrange for the necessary job with the city, or contribute to the family's welfare in some other important fashion – but at a price.\n\nThe price was the promise of the recipients of Tammany largesse to support the machine's favored candidates in the next election. And by using its influence with the poor and powerless to elect reliably corrupt politicians to office, the Tammany machine could ensure that various corrupt contracts and other deals would end up generating revenues for the organization – at the cost, of course, of the taxpayers and the general public. So long as you supported the machine, you probably could count on being able to afford a goose for Christmas dinner, but at the cost of having a corrupt police force, paying higher taxes to pay for streets and buildings that cost more than necessary, or that fell apart quickly after being constructed, or paying higher prices for streetcar service than you should have.\n\nThe analogy obviously isn't perfect, but it looks as if PEPCO, through its employment policies, its connections to the boards of locally important business and charitable organizations, and its seemingly generous contributions to local organizations that are genuinely doing good work, and genuinely need the money – organizations like the House of Ruth, or SOME, or the Cystic Fibrosis Organization or the NAACP, even – is doing what it can to build its own corporate equivalent of Tammany Hall here in the District.\n\nClearly recipient organizations like the House of Ruth and Greater Washington United Way really do need the money; the same is no doubt true for the Nature Conservancy and Emmaus Council on Aging. But the price of PEPCO's supposed generosity to these groups is that DC ratepayers and consumer advocates have apparently lost what little influence we might once have had over the decisions of the PSC, and that we're likely to be confronted soon with sharply rising electricity prices because of it. Worse yet, PEPCO's regionally based patronage machine will now be supplanted by the larger, multi-state patronage machine of Exelon, which should prove even harder for the PSC to regulate than PEPCO has been.\n\nBack in 1903, muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens labeled this sort of corrupt machine politics *The Shame of the Cities.* In 2016, it looks as if Steffens was right.","order":0},{"title":"A Great Marxist Historian Surveys The Rise & Collapse of Communism","date":"2016-03-31","issue":"April 2016","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"**Book Review** of Eric Hobsbawm, *The Age of Extremes: A History of the World, 1914-1991,* Pantheon Press/Random House (New York: 1994), 585 pages (627 pages including references and index).\n\nFor socialists of all varieties, the nature and ultimate fate of the 1917 Russian Revolution are topics that appear to be inescapable. Even today, 25 years following the collapse of the Soviet Union, democratic socialists are still likely to confront conservative [*critics who claim*](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/03/reminder-liberalism-is-working-marxism-failed.html) that \"socialism\" at heart is no different from Russian-style Communism, which was almost complete evil from the conservative perspective. To the left of DSA, meanwhile, we're still likely to encounter campus-trained Marxists, some with doctorate degrees, who claim to see the Bolshevik Revolution – properly interpreted, of course – as a template for what all \"real\" socialists should be doing in the twenty-first century.\n\nFor democratic socialists who haven't immersed themselves in this history of Soviet-inspired Communism and what became of it, and who thus find themselves caught in the debates between the right and the left with no clear position on Bolshevik-style Communism, *The Age of Extremes,* by the late British Marxist Eric Hobsbawm, offers a sweeping account of Communist history that's well worth reading.\n\nIt's an old book, admittedly, published just three years after the Soviet Union dissolved, leading much of the global Communist movement to dissolve along with it. By today's political standards, there are some obvious gaps in Hobsbawm's analysis, which says much too little about feminism, the politics of race or the problems of gender, and gets some of what it does say wrong.\n\nBut Hobsbawm during his lifetime was one of the world's leading Marxist historians, and his often provocative yet balanced account of what international Communism meant in its day is enormously impressive, and has been portrayed as such even by certain conservative reviewers. I think this book therefore is one that could be valuable for many younger DSA members, as well as for older socialists who know they like Hobsbawm, but haven't yet gotten around to reading this volume.\n\nFrom the perspective of many Americans, Hobsbawm (1917-2012) may seem a paradoxical figure. For much of the late twentieth century, Hobsbawm enjoyed a reputation as a leading British historian. He was accepted as a fellow of the British Academy in 1978; in 1998 he was appointed to the exclusive \"Order of the Companions of Honor\" for the Commonwealth countries (where his fellow members included several lords of the realm, Dame Judi Dench and the Queen). From 2002 through 2012 he served as president of Birbeck College at the University of London, and in 2002 the generally rightwing British journal *Spectator* hailed him as \"arguably our greatest living historian – not only Britain's, but the world's.\"\n\nYet for most of his life, from his decision to join the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1936 through his leaving it in 1991, shortly before the CPGB dissolved, Hobsbawm was a loyal Communist, albeit a scholarly one. As a Jewish teenager who had been born in Egypt, but who resided in Berlin in 1931, Hobsbawm was first attracted to a Communist Party youth group at the age of 14 and went on to join the British Communist Party at the age of 19, in 1936. His loyalty to Communism, which originally attracted him as an alternative to fascism, apparently never wavered afterwards.\n\nHe remained in the Party despite the Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939, Nikita Khrushchev's famous denunciations of Stalin at the 20<sup>th</sup> Party Congress in 1955, the Soviet crushing of the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, and the 1968 Russian invasion that ended the \"Prague Spring\" of Communist reformer Alexander Dubcek in Czechoslovakia.\n\nHobsbawm's open membership in the Communist Party over the course of his career, and his contributions to the Party's journal *Marxism Today,* did not destroy his reputation in the UK, as they might have in the US in the 1950s. They did attract some criticism, naturally.\n\nWhen Hobsbawm published *The Age of Extremes* in 1994, following the collapse of Soviet Communism in 1991, the financial historian Niall Ferguson, writing in the UK's generally conservative *Sunday Telegraph,* hailed him as the only living historian \"of whatever political affiliation\" with the knowledge and talent to complete such a sweeping history*.* Kenneth Prewitt of the Rockefeller Foundation wrote that \"Hobsbawm's magisterial treatment of the short twentieth century will be the definitive *fin-de-siecle* work.\" On the other hand, a number of vocal anti-Communist writers, including historian Robert Conquest and the Polish ex-Communist Leszek Kolakowski, publicly attacked *Age of Extremes* for allegedly soft-pedalling the crimes of such Bolshevik leaders as Lenin and Stalin.\n\nFor some readers today, it may seem from the tone of Hobsbawm's rather non-judgmental prose that the anti-Communist critics of 1994 had a point. *Age of Extremes* contains few lengthy passages expressing moral outrage over Stalin's crimes – or for that matter, Hitler's authorization of the Holocaust. There are few if any anguished descriptions of what European capitalism meant for European working people during the 1930s Depression, either, or what British imperialism meant for India and South Africa. Nor does Hobsbawm devote more than a few paragraphs to the violent Chinese convulsions that resulted from Mao's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.\n\nWhat Hobsbawm does in *Age of Extremes,* however, is offer an essentially Marxist critique, albeit at a high level of abstraction, of what he saw as the inevitable shortcomings of Russian Bolshevism following the October Revolution of 1917. He also concludes his work with an essentially Marxist repudiation of Soviet-style Communism – \"the original ideal of a single, centrally controlled and state-planned economy based on a completely collectivized state\" — as a workable model for future socialists.\n\nThe Soviet system that Lenin and the Bolsheviks established after the revolution of 1917, Hobsbawm writes,\n\n\"was designed not as a global alternative to capitalism, but as a specific set of responses to the particular situation of a vast and spectacularly backward country at a particular and unrepeatable historical conjuncture. The failure of revolution elsewhere \\[which Lenin and other Bolsheviks hoped would occur in response to the Bolshevik seizure of power\\] left the USSR committed to build socialism alone, in a country in which, by the universal consensus of Marxists in 1917, including the Russian ones, the conditions for doing so were simply not present.\"\n\nThe attempt to make the Bolshevik version of socialism succeed in the old Russian empire, Hobsbawm acknowledges, produced \"remarkable achievements – not least the ability to defeat Germany in the Second World War,\" particularly considering that Tsarist Russia had been unable to defeat the Germans in World War I. The fact that Stalin's USSR, despite its history of drastic political purges and mass starvation among the peasantry, managed to beat Hitler's armies in the 1940s while the Tsar's Russian empire had been unable to beat the Kaiser's military forces before 1917 showed that Communist Party rule had produced real benefits.\n\nBut in Hobsbawm's view, Russian Communism's achievements came \"at quite enormous and intolerable human cost.\" and \"at the cost of what proved eventually to be a dead-end economy and a political system for which there was nothing to be said.\" The \"really existing socialism\" of Eastern European societies under Soviet oversight during the Cold War operated under \"the same disadvantages, although to a lesser extent,\" as that of the USSR, Hobsbawm observes*.* The book therefore concludes that \"a revival or rebirth of this pattern of socialism is neither possible, desirable, nor – even assuming conditions were to favour it – necessary\" – a remarkable statement, given Hobsbawm's own political history.\n\nMost democratic socialists have long agreed the Soviet-style Communism offers no socialist answers for the future. But for those of us with only a limited familiarity with Communist history, it is worth reading through this long and multifaceted book, although selectively, to understand how Hobsbawm's Marxist analysis differs from that of the anti-Communist conservatives.\n\nIn a nutshell, Hobsbawm agrees with Marxist scholars who have written that Tsarist Russia, in 1917, was ripe for revolution and yet drastically unsuited for the development of socialism according to Marx's theories about the historical stages of economic development. Russia in 1917 was largely a peasant society, with a small although politically active industrial proletariat. As a multi-ethnic empire it was proverbial for cultural backwardness and superstition, with a low literacy rate and a largely feudal government. Marx and Engels had originally predicted socialist revolution only in much more economically advanced capitalist societies.\n\nAs Hobsbawm notes, then, virtually all Marxists before 1917 agreed that it would be impossible to build socialism in Russia – unless, that is, the Russian Revolution quickly inspired successful socialist revolutions in more advanced European societies, such as Germany, that had been enduring enormous suffering thanks to the First World War.\n\nGambling on the likelihood of their example inspiring socialist revolutions in war-torn European countries, the Bolsheviks seized power almost bloodlessly in October of 1917 and, after first trying to govern in alliance with anarchists in the left wing of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, soon found themselves forced to govern as a single party during an extremely brutal civil war. At the end of the civil war in 1920 they found themselves in control of a huge, still backward land in which the revolutionary wing of the working class had largely been killed off and an already limited industrial economy had been devastated.\n\nFor a few optimistic years it looked as if the European socialist revolutions the Bolsheviks had hoped for would occur, but by the early 1920s all these revolutions had failed, leaving the surviving Bolsheviks with the challenge of trying to build socialism – or at least a decent society – in a situation where Marxist theory said success was almost impossible.\n\nBy 1921 Lenin himself realized that the Bolsheviks represented almost no one but themselves, Hobsbawm writes, and to rebuild the economy they adopted a New Economic Policy (NEP) that essentially allowed the reemergence of small-scale capitalism, which peasants who had seized the estates of Tsarist nobles in 1917 took to enthusiastically. But the chances of building socialism on a basis of peasant capitalism were slim; there were potential conflicts looming between the agricultural peasant economy and the urban industrial workers, and eventually, following Lenin's death and Stalin's rise to power, the Communist-led government chose to push ahead for rapid industrial growth and the collectivization of agriculture.\n\nUnder even enlightened leadership this course of action would have meant forcing the vast majority of the peasants, and many industrial workers, too, to make immediate sacrifices in living standards that most Russians disliked, Hobsbawm indicates: \"Any policy of rapid modernization in the USSR, under the circumstances of the time, was bound to be ruthless and, because imposed against the bulk of the people and imposing serious sacrifices on them, to some extent coercive.\"\n\nEven without Stalin, too, the increasingly hierarchical structure the Communist Party had developed during and after the civil war meant that there was a risk of Communist rule in the USSR developing into dictatorship. Stalin, however, exercised a unique degree of \"ferocity, ruthlessness and lack of scruple\" in consolidating his rule, Hobsbawm reports.\n\nPartly because he lacked the charisma and self-confidence that Hitler could deploy to inspire members of the Nazi Party in Germany, \"Stalin ruled his party, as everything else within reach of his personal power, by terror and fear.\" Among other things, he purged the Party itself and the officials of the government of several million people between 1934 and 1939, and he had upwards of 400,000 of them executed. His authority as an autocrat, therefore, came to be nearly absolute. Meanwhile, Stalin's economic policy of rapid industrial growth did enjoy some positive results, although at great social cost. The collectivization imposed on the peasants, however, was a disaster and caused a major famine in 1932-33.\n\n\"It will probably never be possible to calculate the human cost of Russia's iron decades adequately,\" Hobsbawm writes of the Stalin years, but \"the number of direct and indirect victims must be measured in eight rather than seven digits.\" Whether the total number was closer to 10 million or 20 million victims, it was \"shameful and beyond palliation, let alone justification.\"\n\nYet largely because it suffered from a virtual economic blockade imposed by the West, Stalin's USSR continued growing economically in the 1930s even as the leading capitalist countries were wracked by depression, giving a real cachet to Communism in the Stalinist mode. Then during World War II, following Hitler's unbelievably ill-judged invasion of the USSR, the stubborn resistance of the Russian people to German sieges and military occupation broke the Nazi advance, and was soon followed by the Red Army pushing the Germans back to Berlin – a military feat crucial to winning the war, and one that added to the international allure of Communism.\n\nThe result, Hobsbawm argues, was that an improvised Communist economy cobbled together to bring about industrialism in less-developed societies that were unready for socialism ironically became the model for revolutionary socialists nearly everywhere. A Communist Party that had developed dictatorial or at least authoritarian features quite out of keeping with what most Marxist socialists had envisioned before 1917 became the backbone of a global revolutionary force of remarkable discipline and tenacity, while also inspiring the formation of similar elite-led, authoritarian parties in many Third World societies undergoing anti-colonialist revolutions.\n\nAnd yet by the late 1980s in Eastern Europe and in the USSR itself, socialist central economic planning as the USSR had first developed it found itself unable to compete effectively against the capitalist West, in part because Communist Eastern Europe and the USSR itself were now far more economically integrated with the West than Russia had been in the 1930s. The Russian people in the 1980s actually were living more comfortably than they had been in decades, Hobsbawm writes, but their economy was vulnerable to the global economic recession then plaguing the Western liberal democracies, and it was clear to Soviet leaders that their economy was in trouble, partly because it was less efficient in adopting new capitalist technologies.\n\nMeanwhile vanguardist Communist parties based on Leninist principles, but increasingly staffed by careerists with selfish motives, were failing to inspire most working people in the Communist world with any real zeal for either socialism or Marxism. This was partly because the Communist Party itself was committed in theory to being a revolutionary elite, standing above the mass of people rather than reflecting their ideas and desires. And when a Communist Party boss with a genuine interest in returning to a more democratic and egalitarian form of socialism, Mikhail Gorbachev, attempted to reform \"actually existing socialism,\" all he succeeded in doing was destroying it.\n\nThis is a gross over-simplification of what Hobsbawm writes in *The Ag*e *of Extremes,* which also surveys how the international Communist movement influenced revolutions and reform movements in a number of other societies, notably including China, Southeast Asia, Cuba and Latin America. But this is the essence of what Hobsbawm thinks went wrong with Communism. Besides outlining the history of Soviet Communism itself, however, Hobsbawm with considerable literary skill, and an almost novelistic talent for words at times, also uses this work to outline a variety of intellectual connections between Soviet-style Communism and other important developments in what he calls the Short Twentieth Century.\n\nPolitically and economically, these developments include the two world wars of the 1917-1945 period, the deep depression of the 1930s and the fascist and Nazi movements that emerged from it, the unusual cooperation between Soviet Russia and the western capitalist powers that defeated fascism in World War II, the global Cold War that resumed between the Communist bloc and Western capitalism from the end of the war through 1991, and the era of anticolonial, generally anti-European revolutions that already were underway in the 1920s and that continued until nearly 1980.\n\nHobsbawm also explores the capitalist \"Golden Age\" of 1945-1970 and how both the lessons of the Depression years and the challenge of Communist-inspired revolutions during the Cold War affected it, partly\nby inspiring capitalist governments to adopt social safety nets of\nvarious kinds as a political safeguard against domestic radicalism.\n\n*The Age of Extremes* likewise examines the emergence of \"modernist\" avant-garde developments in art, music and literature before 1914, and their further development through the 1930s; the era of \"postmodernist\" art and literature after 1970 that led to the repudiation of modernist thinking in several artistic fields and European philosophy; and (to a limited degree) the new feminist movement that emerged in western capitalist societies after 1960. This accompanied a general cultural revolution in prosperous capitalist societies in the 1960s that Hobsbawm – rightly or wrongly – essentially identifies as individualistic, and either anti-social or at least asocial.\n\nOn the other hand, Hobsbawm in this book seems shockingly indifferent to, and ignorant of, developments in black political activism and thought in the capitalist West and the USA since the 1950s. Thus his index contains no entries for W.E.B. Dubois, who had famously argued that \"the problem of the Twentieth Century will be the problem of the color line,\" nor for Malcolm X, nor for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., nor for the Pan-Africanist Marxist writer C.L.R. James, nor for Franz Fanon.\n\nShowing a similar set of intellectual and political limitations, Hobsbawm's text labels gay cultural pioneers as \"homosexual\" and spends virtually no time discussing them, much less the gay political activism that followed the 1969 Stonewall riot in the United States or the radical activism of Act Up protesters addressing the AIDS crisis in the 1980s. In these ways he appears oblivious to the socialist politics of intersectionality, although he must have had at least some exposure to the ideas of Stuart Hall, a British contemporary of Hobsbawm's and a cofounder of *New Left Review*, concerning the intersection of race, class and gender in leftwing British politics.\n\nOne of Hobsbawm's strengths in *Age of Extremes,* on the other hand, is his section on revolutions in science that contributed to sweeping changes in capitalist societies, and that through technological change probably contributed to the collapse of Communist societies, in the period leading to 1991.\n\nNoting that in both the Communist world and the capitalist West, the end of the \"Golden Age\" in the late 1970s ushered in a new period of crisis – across the heavily indebted societies of the Third World, Hobsbawm observes, the 1980s were a decade of economic catastrophe – Hobsbawm concludes *Age* *of Extremes* on a note, not of political despair, but of extreme political and economic uncertainty.\n\nAlthough he did not, by the early 1990s, foresee the growing popularity of rightwing fundamentalist religious movements or the anti-terrorist battles of the new century, Hobsbawm in this book portrays his Short Twentieth Century as uniquely marked by increasingly brutal forms of war, by ambiguous and often dysfunctional forms of revolution, and by a general breakdown of traditional social and religious mores and structures of cooperation, thanks largely to the advance of consumer capitalism and capitalist individualism.\n\nHe also, toward the end of the book, remarks on the evident incompatibility between capitalism – especially the neoliberal or \"free market\" form of capitalism that Reaganite USA and Thatcherite Britain adopted during the 1980s – with the preservation of the natural environment.\n\nHobsbawm in this book completely rejects \"zero growth\" environmentalism, noting that around the world, large and growing populations of poor people, many facing unemployment, wanted more economic development in the early 1990s, not less. And yet, he concludes in *Age of Extremes*, supporters of environmentally sustainable economic policies are correct: \"In the long run, a balance \\[will\\] have to be struck between humanity, the (renewable) resources it consume\\[s\\], and the effect of its activities on the environment.\" No one in 1994 knew just how such a balance can be established, Hobsbawm writes, but\n\nOne thing ... was undeniable. It would be incompatible with a world economy based on the unlimited pursuit of profit by economic enterprises dedicated, by definition, to this object and competing with each other in a global free market. From the environmental point of view, if humanity was to have a future, the capitalism of the Crisis Decades \\[e.g. the neoliberalism of the post-Reagan and post-Thatcher years\\] could have none.\"\n\nIn the last section of *Age of Extremes,* Hobsbawm therefore provides the reader with a series of seemingly overwhelming challenges, writing in his chapter *Towards the Millennium* that the short twentieth century had ended \"in a global disorder whose nature was unclear, and without an obvious mechanism for either ending it or keeping it under control,\" with the added proviso: \"The reason for this impotence lay not only in the genuine profundity and complexity of the world's crisis, but also in the apparent failure of all programmes, old and new, for managing or improving the affairs of the human race.\"\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union and its form of Communism in 1991 had cast doubt on all forms of revolutionary socialism by the early 1990s, Hobsbawm concludes; the experience of Thatcherite Britain by the 1990s had shown pure free market capitalism to be dysfunctional as well. More worrisome were the flaws and weaknesses of social democratic mixed economies in Europe during the crisis years that followed the Golden Age, and most worrisome of all were the challenges posed by rapid world population growth, climate change and other forms of environmental crisis, as well as the ongoing breakdown of the nation state as a mode of governance in much of the world.\n\nEconomic globalization and the transfer of industrial jobs from high-wage Western economies to low-wage Third World economies posed another set of unsolved problems, Hobsbawm noted in 1994, and the logic of capitalist labor-saving efforts indicated that the ongoing automation of work was likely to create added problems with unemployment.\n\nIn the last few pages of *Age of Extremes,* accordingly, Hobsbawm states that \"What I have written cannot tell us whether and how humanity can solve problems it faces at the end of the millennium.\" Yet it is clear, he concludes, that \"behind the opaque cloud of our ignorance and the uncertainty of detailed outcomes, the historical forces that shaped the century \\[are\\] continuing to operate. We live in a world captured, uprooted and transformed by the titanic economic and techno-scientific process of the development of capitalism, which has dominated the past two or three centuries.\"\n\nThere is good reason to think that this essentially capitalist process cannot continue indefinitely, *The Age of Extremes* adds, since \"the forces generated by the techno-scientific economy are now great enough to destroy the environment, that is to say, the material foundations of human life,\" while likewise threatening the \"some of the social foundations of the capitalist economy.\"\n\nIn later books published before his death, such as *How to Change the World,* (a series of essays on the merits and limits of Marxism), Hobsbawm went on to suggest that the problems with the line of development inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution do not have to doom all future hopes for socialist change. He also makes a few hopeful asides to this effect in *Age of Extremes*. But to Hobsbawm in 1994, both Soviet-style central economic planning and Western capitalism on the \"free market\" model had proved their bankruptcy, and the global history of the Short Twentieth Century had shown itself to be far more complicated than most capitalists and most socialists of his age were willing to acknowledge. In *Age of Extremes,* Hobsbawm fails to provide simple answers to the century's violence, economic turbulence, environmental distress and scientific upheaval; his attempt to grapple with its complexity, though, is something socialists should be able to learn from.","order":1},{"title":"Abortion Rights and Reproductive Justice: Continuing the Discussion","date":"2016-03-31","issue":"April 2016","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"Abortion rights, if they are to be meaningful for all women, need to be linked to other rights women are too often denied. Genuine reproductive justice therefore entails access to services and multiple other important legal and social protections. Explaining how existing rights can be protected while also expanding services within the context of current political realities were the themes of presentations given at Metro DSA's March 17 Socialist Salon by Michelle Woods, public and legislative affairs manager, Planned Parenthood Metropolitan of Washington and Tucker O'Donnell, PPMW's director of education. A wide-ranging discussion amongst the more than 20 attendees followed.\n\nLisa Stand introduced the meeting by referring to a demonstration held in front of the Supreme Court two weeks earlier as the Court was considering *Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt*, a case that challenges the constitutionality of a Texas law that has led to closure of more than half the abortion clinics in the state. The rally called attention to how such laws undermine the formal legality of abortion by creating obstacles such that many women – poor and working class, young or abused, single or unsupported and, overwhelming black and Latina – are unable to obtain one.\n\nThe sudden death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in mid-February means that the Court is unlikely to allow the Texas law to be used as a precedent elsewhere in the country. But the 4-4 divide on the Court means that it is also unlikely to strike the law down, and thus legislation causing abortion clinics to close or forcing them to turn away potential patients, will remain in place. The solution to this situation, therefore, must be political. Politics which were made visible at the rally, a multiracial, multigenerational gathering putting forward positive demands that spoke to full reproductive rights – and therefore social rights – for all women, embodying therefore the principles of reproductive justice.\n\nO'Donnell opened by describing her work helping high school students to develop and strengthen an understanding of healthy relationships and consent, both fundamental to any personal understanding of the social meaning of reproductive justice. This also brings home the limitation of many current discussions, which isolates individual circumstances from any broader context. For example, when defenders of abortion rights argue that it should at least be available for victims of rape, they often fail to the ask why so many women are so victimized, to raise the reality that assaults on women's bodies by laws which restrict choice is the flip side of assault in the form of violence against women, of violence against women, of domestic abuse. Regarding teenagers, O'Donnell added the critical importance of men being part of the conversation, otherwise all the pressure is on women.\n\nWoods talked about that broader context. She noted that the phrase \"reproductive justice,\" gets us away from \"choice,\" which is individual, too narrow and not strong enough to convey the full meaning of what is at stake. By contrast, bringing justice into the equation can demonstrate how choice is integral to women's physical, mental, spiritual, social and economic rights. This is the terrain of current struggles which in Virginia is to stop bad legislation and practices, in Maryland is to continue to develop positive programs and in DC is to promote best practices as well as end congressional interference with District government initiatives (her discussion on this reinforced the description of local challenges/possibilities put forward by representatives of NARAL at DSA's February membership meeting).\n\nBoth O'Donnell and Woods noted how many of the successful attacks on abortion current stem from the 1989 Supreme Court decision *Casey v. PA,* which gave states power to make their own laws as long as these don't constitute an \"undue burden\" for women. That decision weakened the abortion rights protections guaranteed by the Court's 1973 *Roe v. Wade* decision, they said. The full implications of that weakening have been made especially clear since 2011 when Tea Party candidates made enormous gains in gubernatorial and state legislative elections, as Republican-dominated states have placed increasingly onerous restrictions on women's access to abortion through the passage of Trap Laws (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) that have forced the closure of numerous clinics.\n\nThese laws put forward unnecessary licensing provisions that cause many clinics to close, require medical practioners to give patients false or misleading information about the medical risk of abortion, and impose waiting periods that are both financially and emotionally onerous. This is precisely what is at issue in Texas, as well as in Mississippi, Louisiana and other states. Trap laws put an undue burden on poor women who are economically disenfranchised – women who are primarily black and Latino. A recent documentary film [*Trapped*](http://www.trappeddocumentary.com/) gives viewers insight on the impact of this on those who are already vulnerable.\n\nAt the same time – and contrary to the implication of abortion opponents argument that is an isolated phenomena – abortion is common in the United States. According to statistics cited at the meeting, about 1/3 of women in the U.S. will have one during their fertile years, the majority when they are in their 20s (and the majority of whom are already mothers). Unsurprisingly, the number of abortions goes down when women have more sound information about reproductive health.\n\nQuestions that followed kept coming back to what we can do to do better, such as how to better organize locally and nationally. This discussion was, therefore, not the end of the discussion, but part of a continual process that we have to return to again and again. As reproductive rights historian Linda Gordon puts it, laws to limit abortion and to reinforce gender inequality are both a form of oppression in their own right and – in their appeal to sexism \"entice poor, working-, and middle-class citizens to vote against their economic interests.\" ([**False Protection, Real Oppression: Opposing Anti-abortion Legislation by Linda Gordon**](http://www.dsausa.org/false_protection_real_oppression_opposing_anti_abortion_legislation), **Democratic Left**, Spring 2016).\n\n\n\nThe links below provide background information that can also help further stimulate discussion on the reproductive justice issues discussed at the Salon:\n\n\n\n**Background**\n\n-   **The Hyde Amendment** bars federal dollars for Medicaid to cover abortion.

The obvious relish with which he turned [*Werner Sombart*](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=7&ved=0ahUKEwjIi-mT_tbLAhVIWSYKHe44AZsQFghQMAY&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyu.edu%2Fsteinhardt%2Fe%2Fpdf%2Fhumsocsci%2Fmias%2Freadings07%2F21.pdf&usg=AFQjCNFB7xd8SjAPvftboygB56Nns0sOJA&sig2=mUrxQ-0hJaFHaFowm3YY5A&cad=rja)'s \"Why is there no socialism in America?\" on its head set the tone for a well-attended conclave March 12 on how to turn the Bernie Sanders campaign – win or lose – into a permanent left movement, \"Continuing the Political Revolution.\"\n\nThe one-day conference at the Communication Workers of America international headquarters in downtown DC was put on by the Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nMeyerson suggested that the question of why socialists, why now was a useful angle into the creation of an ongoing movement. Polling shows, he said, that acceptance of not only the idea of socialism but the personal identification as a socialist was wider even than the considerable electoral success of the Sanders campaign, which has taken the Democratic Party establishment (and maybe even some longtime socialists)\nby surprise.\n\nDSA founder Michael Harrington, Meyerson said, saw an \"invisible social democracy\" within the Democratic Party and it is now becoming visible via Sanders. He said socialism actually began to emerge around 2011-2012 from the perennial low acceptance in the US that was a residue of the Cold War era.\n\nWhy? \"It's not clear people know that much about socialism,\" Meyerson conceded. But they know that \"capitalism isn't working\" (except for the one percent) and that leads them to be more open to alternatives.\n\nMeyerson attended a debate between Sanders and Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire and found a useful analytic device in the different noisemakers used by supporters of the two candidates. Clinton's supporters used a \"Jedi wand\" that made a distinctive sound – one that was quite audible during Sanders's speech when he hit his signature themes like single-payer health care, free college and a major infrastructure effort. \"There is something happening at the base of the \\[Democratic\\] Party,\" he said \"... not only has Clinton been moved left by the Sanders campaign, but \"Bernie didn't find young people \\[a major supporting cohort\\] – young people found Bernie. Michigan found Bernie.\"\n\n\"We may be having a political realignment... beyond our comprehension,\" he said later during a lengthy and fertile question-and-answer session.\n\nPart of the political realignment is the broadening of political expression and action. Brooks Sunkett, vice president for public employees of the hosting Communication Workers of America, introduced Meyerson with an account of the union's endorsement process – which chose Sanders.\n\nSunkett compared Sanders's positions and past work to those of his opponent, Clinton, saying the union's rank and file discerned the difference on issues of trade, race relations (\"admirable\") and other campaign staples such as the ones that Clinton supporters had applauded in New Hampshire. Unions, he said, were aware they were under attack in the courts and from employers. \"When the 401K was introduced, it was supposed to be a *supplement* to a \\[defined benefit\\] pension. Now, it's a *pension*.\n\nThe Sanders campaign, he said is \"a revolution that \\[CWA\\] needs to be a part of.\"\n\nFew international unions besides CWA have endorsed Sanders; many have endorsed Clinton (though some of their locals have broken away for Sanders). Meyerson observed that although most internationals were not asking their members whom they should endorse, it was an improvement over the first campaign in which he worked, in which the AFL-CIO endorsement and that of all its member unions came from the ultimate top down. \"It came from \\[Lane\\] Kirkland,\" the then-president of the AFL-CIO, he was told. \"That was it.\"\n\nUnder pressure from members and local unions, the AFL-CIO has stayed neutral so far in the Democratic primaries.\n\nMeyerson spoke before voters went to the polls in big Midwestern states and in Florida, but he accurately said Sanders would \"do well\" in Illinois and Ohio. Though he won no states in that round he was competitive in many (Missouri was too close to call for several days) and, because the delegates were awarded proportionally, he came away with a good haul of them. Meyerson said Sanders would go to the Democratic Convention in July with solid backing and the juice to affect the platform positively on issues of trade policy, health care policy and campaign finance.\n\nThe parallel organizing activity for radical policies that could travel and grow with the Sanders campaign's visibility and popularity was the other piece of the puzzle for this conference. Meyerson said DSA would have a role in a coalition that could advance the broader left agenda, within and without the Democratic Party, with \"strength on the ground\" coming from organizations like the [*Working Families Party*](http://workingfamilies.org/) and [*National People's Action*](http://npa-us.org/) (both of which have Maryland state-level affiliates).\n\nManaging the establishment of a stronger, more permanent left in the US is complicated because \"the left has a unity problem,\" Meyerson said, but the solution is \"too important not to figure out.\" He suggested that the terrain of struggle with most benefit is between states and their cities. \"Cities have never been more liberal and states have never been more controlled by the right,\" he said, and the fights, for example, for the $15/hour minimum wage had huge vitality in cities and set even red-state cities like Birmingham, Ala. against their state governments.\n\nIn an extended, productive question period Meyerson suggested that Sanders, as a candidate, was pinned down by his own emphasis on class politics, a \"class-oriented mindset\" – more so than would be true of many members of DSA – and that has limited his ability to appeal to identity-based tendencies like Black Lives Matter or more generally the intersectional issues of race and inequality.\n\nThe evident Wall Street power within the corporate wing of Democrats – which dogs Clinton and gives Sanders grist for his critique – gained strength as the Republicans \"morphed\" into a social-issues monolith, Meyerson said. But he has hope that \"something is happening at the base of the Democratic Party\" – perhaps represented by the [*endorsement*](http://senatorpinsky.org/) of Sanders by Sen. Paul Pinsky of Prince George's County. Pinsky is a reliable labor-left voice in the centrist Democratic blue state, and more recently (March 29) announced as one of Sanders's 15-member [*Maryland steering committee*](http://www.marylandscramble.com/2016/03/29/sanders-announces-md-steering-committee/). But his statement set the Sanders effort in a wider context: \"The outpouring of support for Sen. Sanders clearly represents a desire to build a strong, clear, progressive wing within the Democratic Party — in selecting a nominee for president and*beyond*the election.**He has clearly articulated the problem of the concentration of wealth in the hands of a very few**and how this concentrated wealth has come to assert its will in politics, elections and Congress.\" \\[emphasis in original\\].\n\nAsked how DSA members could recapture the socialist perspective that all Sanders's popular proposals are connected in a broad contest with capitalist practices, Meyerson suggested that \"the banks\" – the financialization of capital and its erosion of even the palliative Fordism that tempered capitalism until the late '70s – were the right image to use in establishing the connections among those issues that brought the sound of Jedi wands from the Hillary Clinton cohort in New Hampshire.\n\nClinton's incremental leftward policy moves – such as on trade policy – apparently in the face of Sanders's challenge, actually denoted the Democratic Party's leftward move at the base, Meyerson said – Bernie is not the only factor. \"That's what gives me some hope... there really is something happening at the base of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nHillary, he said, \"knows she can't go back to the '90s.\"\n\nPizza (which vanished quickly before the overflow crowd of 70-plus) and breakout sessions followed Meyerson's well-received remarks, with six working groups tackling questions of both granular strategy for a stronger left, and galvanizing many new to socialism through the Sanders effort.\n\nMerrill Miller, a co-chair of Metro DC DSA's work for Sanders through national DSA's independent expenditure effort, \"We Need Bernie,\" observed:\n\n\"The breakout groups contained individuals from many backgrounds, from those who had long been familiar with DSA but were finally interested in becoming more active to those who had been unfamiliar with the term \"democratic socialism\" until Bernie Sanders' campaign. Similarly, the breakout groups contained individuals with extensive organizing and activist experience, as well as those who longed to become more politically active but until this event had no idea how to do so. This wide range of experience allowed seasoned activists to teach new activists, while also revealing the ways in which the Bernie Sanders campaign has brought new people to democratic socialism and inspired passion for Leftist causes.\"\n\nThis cross-fertilization effect was reinforced by comments from Metro DC DSA activist Jessie Mannisto, who like Miller led one of the groups:\n\n\"Our breakout group contained a good mix of perspectives. We had Boomers and Millennials; DSA members and Bernie campaign volunteers who aren't part of DSA; people who were wary of the S-word and people who were ready to see it revitalized for the American mainstream. The highlight of our discussion was the need to think of new ways to mobilize Bernie voters — including young people who are excited about Bernie but have never voted, and people who don't vote in local and state level elections — both in the primary and beyond.\"\n\nFrom DSA member and group leader Sammy Almashat: \"We were about six people and from different backgrounds, ranging from Marxist to progressive democrat. One person spoke at length of their experience in and disillusionment with the Democratic Party, a sentiment most of us shared. There was palpable enthusiasm about campaigning for Bernie and everyone was curious to know more about what DSA was doing on that (and other) fronts. Overall, a very amiable conversation and hopefully not the last.\"","order":3},{"title":"Carrying a Legacy Forward: Joslyn Williams and the Metro DC Labor Movement","date":"2016-03-31","issue":"April 2016","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"After nearly 30 years, Joslyn Williams is stepping down as president of Metro Washington Council, AFL-CIO. He is succeeded by two people – Jackie Jeter, president of Amalgamated Transit Workers Local 689, will serve as Council President (the first woman elected to that position), and Carlos Jimenez, most recently field organizer for Jobs with Justice, will take on the new position of Executive Director. Each embraces the social unionism – unionism that connects workplace rights to workers' democratic and civic rights – Williams espoused.\n\nIn order to fully appreciate the meaning of this moment when the torch is being passed to a new generation of leaders, it is worthwhile to look back upon the tradition of struggle within which Williams played such an important role.\n\n**Labor Council History**\n\nOr perhaps we should say pre-history.Unions in Washington DC and nearby Maryland and Virginia have a much richer, albeit deeply conflicted, past than is often recalled. By the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, craft unions developed real strength at a time when light industry and small manufacturing were a central part of the local economy. Later, during the New Deal years, federal workers and other public employees unions experienced a surge of growth, coinciding with the growth of the federal workforce. Those unions had a left perspective and with that a focus on racial justice – twin concerns that led to McCarthy-era purges and blacklisting that undermined their strength and progressive perspective.\n\nAs to the more traditional craft unions, most in the Washington DC area accepted (and reinforced) the segregation which was fixed in the local economy of DC as well as throughout Virginia and Maryland. Thus by the mid-1960s local labor was particularly conservative in outlook and – apart from pockets of strengths in skilled trades – weak in its bargaining power. The sea change brought about by the civil rights movement's challenge to racism built into law, custom, industry and government, was to have a profound impact on our region, bringing to the fore people who saw the connection between the need to build labor the labor movement by changing the labor movement and thereby participate in changing our political environment. And this brings us to Joslyn Williams.\n\nBorn in Jamaica, he moved to Washington DC when he was 16 and later studied at Howard University. After graduation and working a variety of jobs such as a taxi cab driver (common in an era when most professional doors were closed to blacks no matter what their educational credentials), Williams gained employment at the Library of Congress. Like many federal agencies at the time, it was an institution which suffered from control by a federal government that even in the era of Kennedy and Johnson still acceded to the power of Dixiecrats in Congress (i.e. white southern Democratic representatives in the House and Senate who were unapologetic in their advocacy of racism as public policy).\n\nThus black workers could not advance, no matter what their credentials, no matter what degrees they earned, no matter what their seniority – a situation that the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) had accepted. Williams did not, serving first as a shop steward and, from 1970, as president of the local, he led a militant workplace campaign to push for institutional change at the Library of Congress.\n\n**Social Justice Unionism**\n\nThe change in the air stimulated by 1960s activism led to other upheavals in unions, including a challenge to the particularly conservative leadership of the local labor council. Robert Peterson of the Typographical Union (printing having been an important industry in the DC area) organized that challenge helping to bring more militant and progressive views to the Council when he was elected as president in 1975. Williams was later elected as his assistant, and then in 1982 as Council President in his own right – the first time an African American was elected to that post, though blacks have formed the majority of the city's population (and certainly the majority of the working class) of DC and the broader metropolitan area since the AFL had first chartered a Council in 1896.\n\nBut this is a story of change – the old guard leadership that opposed the civil rights movement came from ATU Local 689, Jeter's union and today one of the most militant and progressive locals on the Council. Subsequent to Williams's election, UFCW Local 400 and HERE Local 25 used disputes over small policy issues as a reason to disaffiliate, though such disputes had not led locals to disaffiliate in previous years, when Council officers were all white.\n\nBoth Locals eventually reaffiliated and played an important role in organizing campaigns and in supporting the direction Labor Council policy was to take thereafter. And showing the complexity of the process, construction unions in the region, though often a bulwark of labor conservatism in other cities, and sometimes disagreeing with Williams' progressive initiatives, remained affiliated and supported the revival of unionism that was taking place under his leadership. As testament to the path of internal unity, today nearly 200 locals with a combined membership of over 150,000 — the vast majority of eligible locals — are affiliates.\n\nGrowth like that was possible only because of the policies adopted: Quickly after assuming office, Williams took initiatives in support of the fight for pay equity for women workers, to improve workers health and safety conditions, reduce health costs and maintain rent control. Deeply engaged in the political process, the Council supported pro-labor, progressive candidates for local office. Yet that support was never unconditional; Williams was always ready to criticize those in public office when theynarrowed their vision or compromised their commitment to working people. And by that, he meant all working people. As, for example in 1991, street fighting erupted in Mt. Pleasant after a Latino was shot by a policewoman.\n\nIn this complex moment in DC's history, Williams issued a statement calling on city leaders to address the underlying conditions that led to the violence and chiding those city leaders who condemned the violence while forgetting the causes by reminding them of their own roots in the social movements of a then still very recent past. That past included the call for DC statehood, a call and a goal which Williams always supported, unlike others with jurisdictions that included parts of Maryland and Virginia as well as our nation's capital.\n\nIn a sense this is what social justice unionism is all about. The Council has (to name just several of many instances) supported organizing drives for parking lot attendants and taxi cab drivers, supported local unions negotiating campaigns at hotels, warehouses and grocery stores, supported municipal, state and federal workers whenever their rights have been threatened. Affiliates and activists also mobilized under the Council's banner in solidarity for workers engaged in local labor disputes that took on a national character as when pilots, flight attendants, and baggage handlers struck at Eastern Airlines in 1989; National Airport – the union-busting which took place there perhaps the only reason later renaming it for Reagan is apt – being one of the focal points of the struggle. So too, solidarity was simultaneously built on behalf of miners during the Pittston strike in southern Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nWorkers' struggles, however, extend beyond those that can be resolved by bargaining, as evidenced by the Council's engagement in the successful fight for a minimum wage hike indexed to inflation in DC in 2015, and to similar campaigns for a living wage in Maryland's Prince George's and Montgomery Counties and for paid sick leave and just hours across our region. These campaigns all speak to Williams' willingness to connect issues, equally reflected in his role in the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, Jobs with Justice, Labor Campaign for Single Payer Health Care, Alliance for Retired Americans. His engagement with these and other such bodies expresses in practice his commitment to an expansive solidarity. This means supporting the struggles and needs of non-union as well as unionized workers, premised on the understanding that the mutuality at the heart of labor is about giving as well as receiving support – and it is about meeting workers needs off the job as well as well as on it.\n\nNo institution built up under Williams' leadership embodies that as much as the Community Services Agency – which has established a pre-apprenticeship program to help young people gain the reading, math and other skills they need for full apprenticeship opportunities. CSA also helps families deal with job loss, health crisis, substance abuse, sudden unemployment. The importance of the Agency's work stems from the Council's recognition that the role of the labor movement is to be there for working people 24 hours a day – whether on a picket line, participating in an election, or taking part in a charitable drive.\n\nWith this framework, Williams was already acting in the spirit of Union Cities, initiated when John Sweeney was elected AFL-CIO president in 1995. It was a program to breathe new life in the labor movement by rebuilding central labor councils as vibrant organizations that speak to labor's entire program – on and off the job, building union unity within while building union-unity with community, civic, political, and faith-based organizations that engage in social justice advocacy.\n\nMany labor councils failed to act on the possibilities this created, but it fit within the vision and initiatives long a part of Metro DC unionism. One further aspect of this commitment to labor touching all aspects of workers' lives has been the Labor Film Fest, which has developed into LaborFest – bringing music, film, poetry, art that address union heritage, contemporary issues and possibilities of the future to working people in venues across the metropolitan area. All this speaks to a broader understanding of what trade unionism can be at its best. And it validates Williams dual perspective – not only do unions need to change to better defend the rights of all workers, they are capable of changing and a commitment to that process, is a necessary component of all struggles for democracy, civic rights and economic justice.\n\n**Peace and Global Solidarity**\n\nThis often means navigating among differing and conflicting points of view. Metropolitan labor councils, organs of the AFL-CIO, and responsible to the parent federation. As membership organizations, they are responsible to affiliates who elect leadership and pay dues. And they also stand apart as the most recognizable local voice of unionism to the public and to politicians within their jurisdiction. Such multiple layers of responsibility can be paralyzing, but they also create opportunities for leadership to lead by providing linkages across lines of division. But such a possibility can only succeeded if premised on the view of the long haul implicit in the concept of changing within and without that guided Williams throughout his tenure – including when looking out upon the world.\n\nAs noted, when Williams began his tenure at the Library of Congress, he was a member of AFGE. Through the years, AFGE had evolved into a union that fights for its members and so while defending the necessary role of federal programs and federal workers in maintaining the quality of our collective life, it has been vocal when needed in criticizing its employer – that same federal government. But that wasn't always the case, for in its early history AFGE was weak and insecure and so particularly unwilling to challenge its employer – the Executive Branch – on non-workplace issues. And therefore, its leadership in the 1960s-early 70s was adamant in its support of the war in Vietnam (as was the then-leadership of the AFL-CIO). AFGE's leadership, at that time, put in trusteeship and expelled locals that passed anti-war resolutions – including the one at the Library of Congress. Williams, however, among those opposed to that war, protected his Local's assets and played a key role in the ability of those federal worker locals to remain intact by joining AFSCME – whose president Jerry Wurf spoke out early against the carnage being launched from our shores. So when Williams was elected Council President he was Executive Director of its local council of federal workers (AFSCME Council 26).\n\nWilliams' opposition to war abroad and commitment to global solidarity have continued through to the present. One manifestation of this was the space and support he gave to the Central American Labor solidarity movement – a movement which brought together locals opposed to US policy in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua during the civil wars in those countries in the 1980's notwithstanding official AFL-CIO policy at the time that supported Reagan's foreign policy even while being punished by his domestic policy (with AFGE by then a leader of the peace movement nationally alongside the Machinists, and the Clothing Workers – one of the predecessor unions of UNITE-HERE). He also opposed US invasions of Iraq, gave support to ousted Haitian president Jean-Bernard Aristede and stood as a supporter of Michael Manley, the socialist head of state in his native Jamaica.\n\nMost outstanding, however, was Williams's deep engagement in the movement to end South African apartheid, taking steps far in advance of the AFL-CIO. In fact, he was one of the first AFL-CIO leaders to call for freedom for Nelson Mandela, doing so at a public rally in the early 1980s at a time when the Federation's national leadership was too willing to accept the State Department's definition of the ANC as a \"terrorist\" and a \"communist\" organization. Thereafter, Williams worked closely with the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists in the creation of local union anti-apartheid committees, led the Council to give support for the Auto Workers campaign to free imprisoned unionist Moses Mayekiso and committed major resources on behalf of the Mine Workers campaign to boycott Shell because of its support for the racist South African government. This solidarity escaped the sight and memory of many in US union circles, but not the South Africans. When Mandela gained his freedom and did a triumphal tour through the United States, it was Jos Williams who was the AFL-CIO leader who introduced him to the thousands who came to celebrate at the Convention Center.\n\nIn the years since, Williams has worked to oppose all those free trade deals that rob workers here and abroad in the name of global capital, and has worked with the Solidarity Center in support of workers fighting for justice in all corners of the world. This is the arena in which he plans to continue to engage in the future. As he told a reporter from the *Washington Informer*:\n\n\"Workers of the world are not separated anymore by boundaries or by sea ... There are companies with employees in third world countries where they go to find cheap labor and our survival in this country depends on what we do to those businesses who flee to seek cheaper markets.\n\n\"By doing that, those companies have driven down the quality of life in our own country so we've got to follow them. We've got to organize our brothers and sisters elsewhere to make sure that their quality of life is raised ... \\[and\\] stop the exploitation of workers by pitting workers here against workers abroad.\"\n\n**Moving Forward**\n\nThis is the legacy left to the Metropolitan Labor Council's new leadership. Jeter's work as ATU Local 689 president and leadership in the fight for the rights of their members and the safety of passengers, testifies to her ability to build upon the linkages made under William's leadership as well as to forge new ones. So too Jimenez' experiences at Jobs with Justice will serve him well in building coalitions and connecting issues that are essential to labor's ability to continually renew itself as new challenges are posed.\n\nAs a parting thought it is well to recall Williams's introduction of Mandela on that day in DC now more than 20 years ago. He recited the lines of *Solidarity Forever*, giving new meaning to an old song, by paying tribute to the worldwide struggle for freedom that is the true meaning of trade unionism:\n\nWhen the Union's Inspiration through the workers' blood shall run,\n\nThere can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun.\n\nYet what force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one?\n\nBut the Union makes us strong.\n\n...\n\nThey have taken untold millions that they never toiled to earn,\n\nBut without our brain and muscle not a single wheel can turn.\n\nWe can break their haughty power gain our freedom when we learn\n\nThat the Union makes us strong.\n\n...\n\nIn our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded gold;\n\nGreater than the might of armies magnified a thousand-fold.\n\nWe can bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old.\n\nFor the Union makes us strong.\n\n\n\n*Solidarity forever*!\n\n\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nD.C.

Democratic socialists with a tolerance for reformism might want to glance at how each magazine addresses the topic.\n\nThe cover of the March 7, 2016 *Nation* bears the title \"Game Changers: How we can unrig the rules and reverse runaway Inequality,\" and alerts readers to a special section inside outlining eight specific plans to create greater economic equality in the U.S. economy. These include, among other things, helping black workers to fight for union rights and the protection of public-sector jobs, imposing a small financial transaction tax on Wall Street to fund needed social spending, tackling metastasizing levels of student loan debt, and imposing new taxes on luxury consumption (like jet airline travel, for example) involving high levels of fossil fuel use.\n\nThe December 15 issue of *Foreign Affairs* features a somewhat more theoretical cover story by Pierre Rosenvallon called \"How to Create a Society of Equals: Overcoming Today's Crisis of Inequality.\" Rosenvallon states that the relatively greater levels of income equality in capitalist societies during the middle part of the 20th century were primarily due to three factors: a fear of socialist/communist revolution that inspired even rightwing autocrats – similar to Bismarck in the late 19th century — to support social welfare legislation, a growing sense of national community that drew together several societies out of necessity during the two world wars, and a sense among intellectuals that poverty does not reflect individual character failings, but the operation of social institutions. All three factors are largely lacking in contemporary societies, Rosenvallon concludes, and \"Only a more robust vision of democratic equality—based on the singularity of individuals, reciprocal relations among them, and a social commonality—can provide the foundation for broadly accepted public policies that can attack the trends toward inequality that are hollowing out contemporary economies and polities.\" Democratic socialists might not welcome every detail in Rosenvallon's description of how to achieve this, though.\n\n*Foreign Affairs* has a pay wall, but non-subscribers who register may access one free article a month.

The set design and costumes for the Ballet's current performance of a George Ballanchine version of the Shakespeare comedy \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" as many dance reviewers have noted, are supposed to make the action seem to take place underwater. Thus the comic character Bottom, who in Shakespeare's script magically acquires the head of a donkey, in this production acquires the head of a Florida manatee instead. The set, as described by *The Miami Herald,* includes a back wall and transparent scrim at stage front on which shifting images of \"enormous, ethereal sea plants and creatures\" are projected, while the costumes combine \"silvery, shimmery unitards, feathery seaweed skirts \\[and\\] swooping coral headdresses\" to make the dancers seem like darting fish. According to an interview in a Miami-based email newsletter called *The New Tropic*, the set and costume designer Michele Oka Doner, daughter of a former Miami Beach mayor, wanted the production both to reflect the natural beauty of the ocean front in South Florida and to evoke the risks of it all being wrecked by ongoing environmental change. Florida governor Rick Scott has forbidden state employees to even speak the words \"climate change,\" Doner noted, and \"Placing the ballet underwater ... was a call to look at and celebrate what we have before we lose it.\" For texts of what various reviewers have written about the production (including a bemused piece by *New York Times* dance critic Alasdair Macaulay, who found Doner's sets and costumes nonsensical but \"agreeably harmless\") see the Miami City Ballet's web site at [*http://www.miamicityballet.org/*](http://www.miamicityballet.org/) . ***–Andy Feeney***\n\n\n\n**&gt;&gt;**Even though the Democratic Primary continues to be tight, there's already a back-and-forth on the general topic of \"Bernie or bust,\" a sentiment that suggests that if Bernie is not on the ballot in November then progressives might as well stay home.

Deutsche Bank also is backing away from the financing of mountain-top-removal coal mining, although not from coal-based energy production in general. Corkery quotes a resource analyst with Standard & Poor's rating agency who contends that \"what is happening in coal is a downward shift that is permanent,\" although he also quotes coal industry officials who say that their industry's current economic woes, which partly reflect market competition from cheap and plentiful natural gas, will prove reversible. Corkery also cautions that the banks' apparent disinterest in new US coal-based power generation, which may reflect activist campaigns by groups like the Rainforest Action Network, doesn't mean they are cutting off all funding to the industry completely. JP Morgan Chase, for example, says it will still consider lending to coal-burning power plants overseas, \"so long as they employ environmentally sound technologies.\" For Corkery's article in the *Times,* go to [*http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/business/dealbook/as-coals-future-grows-murkier-banks-pull-financing.html*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/business/dealbook/as-coals-future-grows-murkier-banks-pull-financing.html) . – ***Andy Feeney***","order":5},{"title":"METRO SHUTDOWN SHOWS NEED FOR INVESTMENT IN THE SYSTEM","date":"2016-03-31","issue":"April 2016","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"The one-day shutdown of the entire Metrorail system on March 16 for safety checks was unprecedented for our local rapid-rail system. Whether it was necessary has been a lively topic of debate; but new General Manager Paul Wiedefeld obviously felt, with safety meltdowns coming in rapid succession, that it was time to go big on safety or go home. The 2009 Fort Totten crash that killed nine and last year's electrical arcing incident that caused the death of one passenger from smoke inhalation and sent dozens of others to the hospital were only the ugliest symptoms of a system in crisis. And last month's closure might be only the beginning: [*Metro now is considering shutting down entire lines for repairs for months at a time.*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/2016/03/30/fba8ae0a-f688-11e5-9804-537defcc3cf6_story.html?hpid=hp_local-news_no-name%3Ahomepage%2Fstory)\n\nThe current state of Metrorail represents a long, sad decline from the palmy days of the 1970s and 1980s when the system was spanking new and a rebuke to the dirty, often unreliable and sometimes unsafe systems in older U.S. cities. In the early days Metro prided itself on being as unlike New York's crime-ridden, rat-infested, graffiti-scarred subway system as it could be – with clean, airy stations, graffiti-free cars and smooth and efficient service. Today, a ride on the New York subway shows that Metro could learn a lesson or two from its big sister on how to turn around an aging urban rail network.\n\nA lot of media coverage and political sniping has cast blame on Metro management for the deterioration of the system. But no management, regardless of how brilliant or dedicated it was, could succeed in the face of decades of underinvestment in Metro by the local jurisdictions as well as the federal government. The lack of a dedicated local source of revenue has been a festering wound that has left Metro short of reliable funding since its beginnings. This was an issue that the local chapter of Democratic Socialists of America helped bring to light when it spearheaded the creation of the Coalition for Fair Transit Finance (CFTF) in 1984, demanding that Metro stop filling budget gaps with annual fare increases and that DC, Maryland and Virginia work together to create a dedicated funding stream for the system. CFTF did succeed in helping convince WMATA to forego further fare increases for several years, but a dedicated source of funding remains an unfulfilled demand.\n\nA region-wide gasoline tax is often suggested as a means to provide Metro with dedicated funds. Drivers who might object to paying a few pennies a gallon to support Metro might consider how the Metro system – both bus and rail – benefit all commuters in the region. The March 16 traffic was not as bad as some had feared – largely because the federal government allowed most of its employees to stay home – but if Metro closed for a longer period and everyone who had access to a car used it, the resulting gridlock would bring the region to a standstill. In addition, riding Metro contributes less to climate change and other environmental ills than driving, and transit riders don't gobble up parking in congested areas. Transit is a public service that benefits everyone whether they ride it or not, and it deserves better than to be nickeled and dimed to death.\n\nSo don't complain about Metro – demand that your elected officials summon the will to give it the funding it needs to fix its safety and reliability problems before they get worse.","order":6},{"title":"OBAMA SUPREME COURT NOMINATION: A MISSED OPPORTUNITY","date":"2016-03-31","issue":"April 2016","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and a former federal prosecutor, to the Supreme Court seat vacated by the death of Antonin Scalia was, as the pundits have noted, intended to present the Senate with a non-threatening, noncontroversial candidate to whom it would be hard to object. In the thinking of the president and his advisors, an anodyne figure such as Garland, someone without ideological baggage or a crusader image, would deprive Senate Republicans – who have vowed not to give any prospective justice nominated by Obama a hearing, much less a vote – of an excuse not to give his choice fair consideration. If Republicans are serious about leaving the Court one justice short for at least nine months, until a new president takes office – and one must believe they are – Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee and Democratic congressional candidates can use Republican intransigence as another club to batter the GOP at the polls this November.\n\nOr so the thinking goes. No doubt Garland is the paragon of \"[*decency, modesty, integrity, even-handedness, and excellence*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/us/politics/obama-supreme-court-nominee.html?_r=1)\" that Obama says he is. Nevertheless, there is a case that Garland is the wrong nominee for the times. Here are some points to consider:\n\n-   **He's a straight, white, older man** – Call him a SWOM, for short. That is the demographic of which I am a member, and if we were populating the Court from scratch, I might insist on having this group represented on it. But given that of the [*112 Supreme Court justices in U.S. history*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_Justices_by_time_in_office) all but six have been SWOMs (as far as we know – at least none of the other 106 has been openly gay) – we melanin-challenged menfolk could afford to stand back until better karma is in the air. Even with the Court having become more diverse since the 1960s, it still had a SWOM majority until Scalia's death. There were well-qualified women and minorities – including women of color – among the reputed finalists, and a 63-year-old white guy was the best Obama could come up with?\n\nI make an issue of Garland's age because the trend in recent decades has been for presidents to nominate relatively young justices – among incumbents, the oldest when taking office was Ruth Bader Ginsberg at 60; the youngest was Clarence Thomas at 43 – so that they could potentially serve on the court for decades, extending the influence of the president who nominated them far into the future. (Scalia, who was 49 when he joined the Court, served as \"Reagan in a Robe\" for more than a quarter century after his patron left the White House, and Reagan nominee Anthony Kennedy is still with us). In nominating the sexagenarian Garland – [*the oldest nominee since Lewis Powell in 1971*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whitehouse/standout-in-the-law-garland-would-blend-in-at-supreme-court/2016/03/17/620c2da4-ec14-11e5-a9ce-681055c7a05f_story.html) – Obama is attempting to placate Congress by sending them a nominee who probably wouldn't be on the court as long as a younger justice would. In doing so, Obama is sabotaging his own legacy. (Perhaps in the future we might consider a sensible reform such as limiting Supreme Court justices to a single 10-year term, which would create more churn on the court and be a disincentive to the subtle ageism built into the process).\n\nSince Republicans declared that no nominee of Obama's would get a Senate hearing, the only advantage of nominating anyone at all would be to provide a weapon to wield in the November elections. If Obama had nominated, for instance, a strong African-American woman – [*U.S. District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was a reported finalist,*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/activists-push-obama-to-nominate-black-woman-to-the-supreme-court/2016/03/08/cf8aad48-e56a-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html) but she was only one of many possibilities – Democrats not only could have hammered the Republicans on their intransigence, but on their hostility to women and people of color as well. That would have been a powerful call to the Democratic base to turn out to the polls en masse. Obama missed his chance.\n\n-   **He has no social-justice or activist background –** President Obama seems to be the last remaining person to regard Supreme Court justices as impartial arbiters of the law rather than political actors. But nearly everyone else, especially Republicans in the Senate, realize that the court is a third political arm of the government. It has been so at least since John Adams, having already been defeated for re-election by Thomas Jefferson, nominated his Federalist ally [*John Marshall*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall) as Chief Justice, and Marshall went on to be a political thorn in the side of Jefferson and his successors for decades to come. The two current Obama-appointed justices on the Court, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, have become reliable members of the liberal bloc, but neither took office having embraced ideological views as extreme as some Republican court nominees of the recent past, such as Scalia, Thomas, William Rehnquist and Samuel Alito (not to mention GOP nominees whose far-right views torpedoed their confirmations, including Reagan-nominated Robert Bork and failed Nixon nominees [*Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon_judicial_appointment_controversies)). As I argued above, given the Senate's foot-dragging on the nomination, Obama needed to energize the Democratic base by giving them a nominee who would fight for social justice in cases likely to come before the Court on issues such as worker rights, reproductive choice, racial justice, and overturning the Citizens United decision. Instead, [*as legal scholar Jonathan H. Adler notes*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/03/16/initial-thoughts-on-president-obamas-decision-to-nominate-judge-merrick-garland-to-the-supreme-court/):\n\n****On the D.C. Circuit, Garland tends to write and join narrow opinions that rarely break new ground. His decisions tend to hew closely to applicable precedent and (where possible) avoid larger questions, and are generally devoid of ideological thrusts or rhetorical flourish. . .Garland also has a reputation for not being particularly sympathetic to criminal defendants, at least as compared with other appellate judges nominated by Democratic presidents.\n\nThis is truly a nominee Republican senators should love – in fact, back when Obama nominated Sotomayor and Kagan, some of them were reported to lament that [*Obama hadn't nominated Garland instead*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/us/politics/obama-supreme-court-nominee.html?_r=1). Why should progressives leap to Garland's defense?\n\n**He is no friend of democracy for the District of Columbia –** Advocates of full democratic rights for the District have no reason to cheer Garland's nomination, since during his current tenure on the Court of Appeals he was involved in [*a ruling*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/10/17/dc-loses-bid-for-vote-in-congress/cc3fd85a-abe9-459d-9648-45d1998e992c/) that helped derail an attempt to achieve statehood or at least voting representation in Congress – both of which DC, which is under the legislative control of Congress, lacks. Garland, sitting as part of a three-member panel, in 2000 co-authored a decision that rejected a pair of lawsuits filed by DC residents for greater local rights. One of the suits would have required Congress to grant voting representation and the other would have mandated either a path to statehood or union with another state. The third judge on the panel dissented with Garland's dismissal of the suits. Even though the panel rejected the suits, they issue was nevertheless referred to the Supreme Court for review since it involved voting rights, but later that year the high court affirmed the panel's ruling without a hearing.\n\n****The nomination of Garland is another attempt by Obama to appease his domestic opponents – a habit that has been the tragic flaw of his presidency. Instead of staking out a strong position and forcing the opposition to come to him, Obama anticipates the other side's objections in advance and meets them more than halfway before negotiations have even begun. The Affordable Care Act was a case in point: He could have set forth a universal, affordable program such as a single-payer, Medicare-for-All plan as he was urged to by progressives (including Bernie Sanders) as a starting point for discussions. Instead, he anticipated Republican objections, and internalized them in proposing a watered-down proposal inspired by the Massachusetts state healthcare plan that even Mitt Romney supported. Therefore, he started talks from a weak bargaining point, and his already self-compromised plan was further watered down by Congress, including the jettisoning of the public option.\n\nNone of this is to imply that the Left should jump on an anti-Garland bandwagon. We should demand that the Senate respect the nominee of the President and give him a fair hearing and a vote. To paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld, we have to live with the nominee we have, not the one we wished we had. However, this cries out for an ongoing grassroots movement to pressure the White House to select judicial nominees – not only for the Supreme Court but all federal courts – who would bring to the courts a greater regard for social justice as well as more racial and gender diversity. But for now, we can only wonder what might have been.","order":7},{"title":"TRUMP ON DC DEMOCRACY: NO TO STATEHOOD, MAYBE TO REPRESENTATION","date":"2016-03-31","issue":"April 2016","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"In last month's *Washington Socialist*, [*I offered a rundown*](http://dsadc.org/dc-home-rule-whats-the-position-of-the-presidential-candidates/) on the views of the current candidates for President on DC home rule and statehood.

Join us or support us with a donation at our Paypal link over there in the right-hand column.***\n\n**THE COMPILER'S OPENING RANT**: The pace and fast-shifting focus of the presidential primary season has made it hard to take advantage of the opening for democratic socialism that Bernie Sanders's campaign has brought – hard for him, hard for us.\n\nThe peripatetic attention of the voters, and the equally kaleidoscopic methods of the media, have shattered the discourse into many, many issues and increasingly blurred the connections among them. And that's also blurring our unique socialist message – that all these apparently separate political and social issues are the well-meshed moving parts of capitalist political economy, a nicely forged set of fetters for workers well up into the middle class, blending into the tools of domination and subordination wielded by an (often only half-witting) ruling class. It's all connected, we understand – but not in the lens of the day to day campaign.\n\nIt gets worse. Like this writer, many of our readers probably get emails or snail mail with surveys asking them to rank various issues in order of importance to them. This is irritating because it helps in the disaggregation of the issues that emerge from this near-seamless hegemonic structure, as we prefer to view it.\n\nCore meta-issues of ours like better jobs *in a clean-energy, sustainable economy*, emancipation from the unfree workplace *that is fettered by anti-worker regulations*, publicly supported households *from which children can go to well-run public schools* and so forth do not fit well into the \"rank the issues\" framework, of course. It's counterproductive to isolate and rank issues when badly done governance, in a bundle of boss-bought rules, leads to toxic outcomes for individuals, their families and their communities in a self-reproducing bundle. But it keeps happening, because it keeps everyone's eyes off The Man behind the curtain.\n\nThe corollary irritant here is that progressive organizations, our allies, find it necessary to issue these invitations to rank the troubles under capitalism, giving the impression that only raising the minimum wage or only rebuilding the union movement through a better NLRB will be the magic bullet that makes everything else fall into place for a post-capitalist existence.\n\nWe understand why this is done – because most progressive organizations, like ours, have to prioritize their very limited resources and focus on a limited group of issues. So they want to know the ones that will gain them the most support. We at DSA, we have to admit, do the same, dutifully prioritizing by choosing one or two issues to front-burner for the year to come. Our intentions are good, our execution generally terrible because along come the issues of the moment like bowling balls to scatter our careful prioritizing. And we round out our carefully planned year by responding to ***all*** the issues, or at least most of them.\n\nWe wouldn't be surprised to find that other progressive organizations, having gathered those survey results, and prioritized what their members and supporters find most important, find the issues of the real world busting down the door and shredding their pretty priority list, as well. There's no question that DSA, like the other organizations, has to match its capacity to its goals, even as it tries to build capacity through such providential stimulants as the Sanders campaign. But it distracts our attention, and that of others, from what is both our glory and our bane – the recognition that the elements of capitalism are so hard to dislodge because they all lean on and interlock with one another, and the grudging understanding that tackling those elements individually brings only a game of Whack-a-Mole, because the highly adaptable lizard brain of capitalism will recover and renew its strength and dominance via some other element while we are working on the one in front of us. It hampers the message of the Sanders campaign too, contributing to our possibly unfair cavil that he's a social democrat. In this media environment, it's hard **not** to look like that.\n\nThis message problem is not that new, we find. Michael J. Lewis, in a [*recent book review*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/books/review/dream-cities-by-wade-graham.html?_r=0), grumped that most people skip the dialogue-form preamble about the troubles of English society that opens Thomas More's *Utopia* (1516) and move right along to his account of the \"perfected\" society out there in Utopia. That's a mistake, he says,\n\nIn the end, More's real accomplishment was less the far-fetched society he imagined than his recognition of the seamless unity that links economics, crime, health and even architecture — and its *corollary that reforms addressing social problems in isolation were doomed to fail*. \\[italics added\\] ... Jane Jacobs \\[later\\] drew the deeper lesson of \"Utopia,\" which is that one must approach the organic interconnectedness of society with humility and deference.\n\nMore, of course, has run the spectrum of cred today, from the martyred hero of religious liberty in Robert Bolt's 1960s play A *Man for All Seasons* to his role as a narrow-minded religious bigot, justly snuffed, in *Wolf Hall*. As Ellen Meiksins Wood (in *Liberty and Property*) points out, he was a landed-gentry sort who did some enclosing, like his peers. But Lewis has put a finger on why he continues to be read – even incompletely. The society More saw every day, in which communal ownership of the \"commons\" was being ravaged by big landowners who enclosed such areas for the burgeoning sheep-and-wool trade, was showing many of the early markers of capitalist destruction, including desperate lawlessness and the rural unemployment that would drive folk to huddle, near-destitute, in the cities and be fodder for the beginnings of capitalist exploitation throughout the next two centuries.\n\nMore, it appears, resisted prioritizing the ills of his society because of their deep connections – even in advance of capitalism per se. The problem persists for us, surveys or not. It's important to keep our ideal society in our sights – one that retains the lively give-and-take of getting, making and spending without being grounded on the ooze of property-based exchange – as we work against the interlocked obstacles to that ideal community, fighting their tendency to fly apart under our gaze.\n\n**Bogdan Denitch, DSA Honorary Chair and Co-Founder, Dies** – Author, activist and educator Bogdan Denitch, who was a co-founder of both Democratic Socialists of America and its predecessor organization, the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, died on March 28 at the age of 85.

Almost 3,000 people have signed up to risk arrest and sit-in to save our democracy in what will be [*the largest civil disobedience action of the century.*](http://www.dsausa.org/r?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democracyspring.org%2F&e=26583e95b61392ffa0c41aa2c61579a4&utm_source=dsausa&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=demspring2&n=1)\n\nThis Democracy Spring is a mass mobilization backed by over 100 organizations, including the[*Democratic Socialists of America*](http://www.dsausa.org/?e=26583e95b61392ffa0c41aa2c61579a4&utm_source=dsausa&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=demspring2&n=2), [*Young Democratic Socialists*](http://www.ydsusa.org/?e=26583e95b61392ffa0c41aa2c61579a4&utm_source=dsausa&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=demspring2&n=3), Working Families Party, the AFL-CIO, Avaaz, 99Rise, United Students Against Sweatshops and the United States Student Association.

Marchers will meet with their fellow citizens, talk to the media, and create a firestorm of anticipation by laying out a simple choice to Congress: either pass bills to make the 2016 elections free and fair for for all people, or send thousands of Americans to jail simply for demanding an equal voice. To make this march a success, Democracy Spring needs your support. There are already 100+ marchers pledged to participate in the full march, and hundreds more joining somewhere along the route. While the support provided to marchers will be nothing fancy, basic needs must be covered. Here's what we need:\n\n-   Are you a member of place of worship along the march route that'd be willing to host marchers? Are you willing to open your home for a few folks?\n\n-   Marchers need energy. And our energy comes from food. Donate non-perishables or volunteer to lead meal prep at a march stop!\n\n-   *\\[And see the April 9 Greenbelt event for Democracy Spring below\\]*\n\nIf you are able and excited to support Democracy Spring, please contact the Logistics Coordinator at [*democracyspringlogistics@gmail.com*](mailto:democracyspringlogistics@gmail.com). **If you want to meet up with DSA members in Washington, DC, too, contact** [***info@dsausa.org***](mailto:info@dsausa.org) **and/or fill out** [***this form***](http://www.dsausa.org/r?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2F19rZxB3vZIs1e7YrLsUfEhEKtjEeSQojkMoiiMacqEnM%2Fviewform&e=26583e95b61392ffa0c41aa2c61579a4&utm_source=dsausa&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=demspring2&n=5)**.** Lastly, the most simple way for you to support the marchers is through a donation.

Byerly","body":"Election night in Maryland was a downer to those who had supported progressive women candidates in their primary campaigns.\n\nIn her concession speech to Chris Van Hollen on April 26, US Senate candidate [*Donna Edwards*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/heres-what-donna-edwards-said-after-she-lost-her-senate-bid-in-maryland/2016/04/27/b929cd08-0c30-11e6-8ab8-9ad050f76d7d_story.html) noted that Maryland voters had chosen an all-male, nearly all-white slate of Democratic candidates to stand election for Congress in November. She lamented particularly that black women were denied a voice, saying:\n\n\"What I want to know from my Democratic Party is, when will the voices­ of people of color, when will the voices of women, when will the voices of labor, when will the voices of black women, when will our voices be effective, legitimate equal leaders in a big-tent party?\"\n\nEdwards, who had emphasized her gender and African American race during her campaign, raised her own voice to say, \"My friends, this is the 21st-century question for the Democratic Party, and it is time for the Democratic Party to call the question.\"\n\nAnother progressive candidate, [*Joseline Peña-Melnyk*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/joseline-pena-melnyk-for-congress/2016/03/12/598d3c94-e7bf-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html), from College Park, lost her bid to replace Edward in the 4<sup>th</sup> District for House of Representatives, placing third behind Anthony Brown and Glenn Ivey. Peña-Melnyk, who is Afro-Dominican, is a three-term Maryland delegate and a champion of labor, women's rights, and criminal justice reform. She served as a prosecutor, defense attorney, and College Park council woman before running for the Assembly seat – a seat she can fortunately keep now. Two years ago, she led the formation of the Latino Caucus in the Maryland Assembly.\n\nPeña-Melnyk's challengers, both African American, had better name recognition and funding than she did. Probably more important, they are both well ensconced in the powerful Maryland Democratic Party machine. Brown, from Baltimore, was Lt. Governor under former Governor Martin O'Malley, and Ivey was States Attorney in Prince George's County until recently.\n\nMaryland has elected only eight women — five Democrats and three Republicans — to Congress since 1941, including retiring US Senator Barbara Mikulski, who was elected in 1986. Donna Edwards was elected to the House in 2008, and she has been a vocal advocate for women, low-income and minority constituents, and labor. During the Occupy encampment in Lafayette Park, Edwards was reported as being the only member of Congress to meet with Occupy folks and hear their concerns.\n\nVan Hollen, a moderate Democrat who is a Party favorite, will more than likely win Mikulski's Senate seat in November, and Anthony Brown will more than likely win Donna Edwards' US House seat. Brown ran a lackluster and losing campaign against Maryland Republican Governor Larry Hogan three years ago. Lost will be two exceptional women of color to the US Senate and House.\n\n[*Good Reads for Socialists*](http://dsadc.org/good-reads-for-socialists-7/) May 2016\n\nSaturday, April 30th, 2016","order":0},{"title":"GOOD READS FOR SOCIALISTS","date":"2016-04-30","issue":"April 2016","author":"","body":"One of the longer authors' lists around... a cross-section of left thinkers co-signs a letter on the next steps.

Corporate capital, even at this level, calls the tune.\n\nSeveral big disappointments put a damper on some significant progressive victories as the Assembly wrapped its 2016 work at midnight Monday, April 11. A [*last-minute hostage situation*](http://marylandreporter.com/2016/04/12/tax-cuts-paid-sick-leave-fail-in-final-hours-but-hundreds-of-bills-enacted/) left two critically important bills hanging and unpassed – a sweeping tax package that would have harnessed the state and federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to broaden support for working people, and a requirement for employers to provide earned sick leave for up to 700,000 now-vulnerable Marylanders, many low-income. Both had been top priorities of progressive organizations during the session. Their joint demise on the last day of the session meant that the two most potentially far-reaching improvements in the lives of low-income workers were put off for at least another year.\n\nThe Senate leadership's push to add tax breaks for the wealthy to the EITC package led it to keep the earned sick leave bill, which had been passed by the House, trapped in a Senate committee, and both failed at midnight in the endgame. As Progressive Maryland organizer [*Justin Vest wrote*](http://www.progressivemaryland.org/assembly_session_a_reminder_that_power_still_favors_the_wealthy), \"lawmakers certainly didn't disappoint at disappointing Maryland's most vulnerable residents.\"\n\n\"The session started out strong,\" Vest continued, \"with the Democratic majority overriding six of Governor Hogan's vetoes from the 2015 session including one that returned the right to vote to 40,000 formerly incarcerated people, making them eligible to vote in the April 26th primary. But despite positive messages from both chambers, politics as usual got in the way of what stood to be a historic session.\"\n\nProgressives [*could enjoy modest victories*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-sine-die-20160412-story.html) on a big criminal justice package that will cut jail populations and ease sentencing constraints for nonviolent offenses, as well as a police accountability package that will let civilians be a part of police misconduct trials, where previously abusive officers were only judged by other department members.\n\nThe police accountability bill went down to the wire with constant pressure from police to weaken the role of civilians in a reformed process. \"We were wrestling to protect pieces of the police bill up until around 10 p.m.\" the final night, said Larry Stafford, Progressive Maryland's executive director.\n\nSeveral big environmental bills passed with wide support, raising the bar for [*the state's shift to renewable energy resources*](http://marylandclimatecoalition.org/2016-landmark-year-climate-action-clean-energy-maryland/) and the jobs and economic development that would – or should – accompany that shift. And the legislature sent the governor a protection for some of the hardest and most threatened workers around – literally, the \"worker bees\" – against [*lethal neonicotinoid toxins*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bal-bee-advocates-victorious-in-general-assembly-20160407-story.html) in agricultural and consumer lawn and garden products, associated with colony collapse.\n\nFew bills made it through the process without tough fights to prevent weakening by advocates for the business sector, mostly but hardly all from the Republican side. The tax breaks for the wealthy that appeared to have sunk both the EITC package and the paid sick leave bill were supported by the Senate's Democratic leadership and touted as [*making the state more \"business friendly,\"*](http://www.progressivemaryland.org/increasing_inequality_not_reducing_it) a mantra also of GOP Gov. Larry Hogan. For the Assembly's leadership, business-friendly has meant business-captured when push comes to shove.\n\nThe lawmakers were therefore enthusiastic about another tax break, nearly $40 million for defense megacorp Northrop Grumman to soothe the company's hints about leaving the state. Even Republicans cringed about \"corporate welfare\" and Del. Jimmy Tarlau (D-47) said he couldn't find any job creation in the bill (according to a tweet from the *Sun*'s Pamela Wood)... but it passed with near-unanimity.\n\n\"Advocates have been fighting as part of the [*Working Matters coalition*](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=cm#inbox/1541ab0b52ce928d) for four years to win paid sick days for the 700,000 uncovered Maryland workers,\" Vest wrote in his [*session wrap*](http://www.progressivemaryland.org/assembly_session_a_reminder_that_power_still_favors_the_wealthy). \"Fearful of a veto by a first-year governor, some members of the General Assembly thought it best to punt on the issue until now. The bill passed the House with a solid majority for the first time ever. The bill was poised to come out of the Senate committee, but the last-minute vote was canceled when it became clear that [*a tax package loaded up with goodies*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/why-tax-relief--and-sick-leave--died-in-annapolis-this-year/2016/04/24/be9e1860-04e8-11e6-a12f-ea5aed7958dc_story.html) for corporations and the very wealthy was falling apart.\n\n\"That same tax package did include one important component for progressives – expansions to the state [*Earned Income Tax Credit*](http://www.progressivemaryland.org/increasing_inequality_not_reducing_it). The changes would have allowed younger workers ages 18 to 24 to benefit from the credit along with workers without dependents. The EITC is already one of the most effective anti-poverty policies in existence, enjoying broad bipartisan support including President Barack Obama and Speaker Paul Ryan. Approximately 240,000 Maryland workers would have benefited from the expansion by seeing the average tax credit increase from $74 to $375. That money would have gone directly back into the local economy, but a policy benefitting workers without also providing handouts to the wealthy wasn't seen as a priority by those in power.\n\n\"... the legislature did come together to pass a [*comprehensive criminal justice reform package*](http://cnsmaryland.org/2016/04/12/maryland-general-assembly-ends-session-with-criminal-justice-reform-but-no-tax-cuts/) that increases funding for rehabilitation programs while reducing overly punitive policies such as mandatory minimum sentencing. Another bill championed by the Maryland Coalition for Justice and Police Accountability brought [*significant changes to policing*](http://www.progressivemaryland.org/maryland_could_lead_the_nation_on_police_reform) in the state. We came together with activists, victims of police violence, and even law enforcement personnel to demand common sense changes that put people first and eliminate special rights for officers. Among the changes are provisions making it easier for victims and witnesses of abuse to file complaints, including anonymously, creates an independent training and standards commission that will modernize recruitment and set best practices with an emphasis on community policing, increases transparency into department operations, and requires departments to track the number of officer-involved incidents and take preventive action,\" Vest recounted.\n\nDespite some qualified victories, Vest concluded, \"this session also serves as a reminder that politics – at least for those playing the game – isn't necessarily about doing what's right for those in need.\"\n\nOther bills with red flags for injustice or special interest entered the lists this year, and some made it through.\n\nA bill that would have given corporations and wealthy individuals tax breaks for providing [*scholarship money for private schools*](http://www.progressivemaryland.org/school_improvement_or_tax_dollars_for_religious_indoctrination_in_private_schools) finally failed, probably due to embarrassment, but the Assembly for the first time set aside money directly for private schools, a priority of the right getting a foot in the door against public education.\n\nHogan's budget, unlike last year's, fully funded education aid to the school districts around the state – apparently he learned his lesson after a significant furor last year, when the outraged legislators passed a bill (probably of dubious legal standing) that would force him to provide full funding this year. His budget originally shorted Baltimore – still restive from the Freddie Gray upheaval – but a supplemental provided the city some relief in reconstruction from the effects of the uprising, as well as in other areas. The city still will not forgive his de facto cancellation of a rail project, the Red Line, seen as crucial to righting the city's geographical inequality.\n\nBaltimore, heavily dependent on higher education as an economic engine, also stands to [*potentially lose*](http://www.progressivemaryland.org/merger_of_umd_campuses_needs_longer_look) as a result of the merger of two university campuses – the College Park flagship home of the University of Maryland and the university's system's Baltimore campus. The legislature jumped to pass the merger bill despite suggestions that a longer look would be prudent.\n\nThe carnage reminds us of the Assembly truism that it takes three or more years to get a good bill through the legislature but only one year to get a bad bill through. Bills to reform campaign finance routinely fail each year, never coming to the governor's desk, and it's no accident that the legislators' near-invulnerability to challenge at the ballot box is rooted in their creation of \"slates\" to pool campaign funds and fend off those challenges. Efforts to rally the legislature against the Citizens United decision and \"corporate personhood\" also foundered despite [*apparent lip service from the leadership*](http://www.getmoneyoutmd.org/).\n\nYou wonder if part of the reason Larry Hogan is so confoundingly popular among Marylanders (two out of three register Democratic) is that he has gotten in some respects a free pass. The Assembly is so careful not to lose on a veto override episode (needing a supermajority) that they don't send legislation his way that they might not be able to uphold, if vetoed. [*Like paid sick leave*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bal-sick-leave-bill-likely-to-die-in-the-senate-20160407-story.html) or the EITC bill. Like [*automatic voter registration at age 18*](http://marylandreporter.com/2016/04/07/senate-rejects-automatic-voter-registration/). [*The Center Maryland blogger Josh Kurtz*](http://www.centermaryland.org/index.php?option=com_easyblog&view=entry&id=1536&Itemid=286) observes that Hogan is \"a governor who is fluent in social media, skilled at masking his conservative priorities in bromides, and relentless in driving his messaging.\"\n\nThe leadership apparently doesn't want to give the impression of weakness that might be signaled by a failure to override. So they don't risk the confrontation. It's likely, too, that there are Democratic delegates or senators in risky districts who need to avoid voting on some of these bills. Well, next year is even closer to 2018 and they will have less time to tuck such votes into the memory hole. Meanwhile, good bills get the back of the hand for another year. Will next year be easier?\n\nThe leadership's power trip keeps these highly valuable bills, and the issues and failures of public will that they involve, basically out of the discourse at all. Because they don't want to lose. There are worse things, one would think, than \"losing\" to a governor whose right-wing allegiances are being hidden from the public – with the help of the Assembly leadership. How are people in general going to see what the genial Larry Hogan is fronting for – the pro-business, anti-worker forces that maintain affluent Maryland's many inequalities in everyday life – if the Democrats in the Assembly dodge that confrontation whenever it looks as though they might lose?\n\nIf Hogan showed his true colors by vetoing good bills like paid sick leave, police reform, and the many other good bills we have mentioned, people might begin to see through the good-guy façade to his being joined at the hip with the business community and the wealthy. Surely the Democrats – who are all too cozy with those same forces as well – could use to sharpen the contrast.\n\n*Woody Woodruff, a production editor for the *Washington Socialist*, also moderates the blog for* [**Progressive Maryland**](http://www.progressivemaryland.org)*, from which some of this material is shamelessly repurposed*.

I had spent six hours on foot trying to contact possible Bernie voters in a nearby Aspen Hill neighborhood characterized by biggish houses, large and widely separated building lots, very long driveways and a bewildering labyrinth of winding side streets and small cul de sacs, and I had had enough walking for the day. It had been a beautiful area to canvass, admittedly, with tall and stately trees and flowering azaleas and dogwoods and on one hilly street two deer gazed at me calmly from someone's front yard as I trudged past looking for an address. But now I wanted to go home.\n\nFor more than half an hour I had been standing on the highway divider along Maryland 182, Layhill Road, wearing my bright red \"DSA for Bernie\" shirt in hopes my ride from the office would see me easily. There's not that much to do or see at the intersection of 28 and 182, although the countryside is pretty enough, and I was growing a little bored when the crows caught my attention.\n\nFirst there were three or four of them, up ahead and to my right, and they were circling slowly in an updraft, high above an open field, as though looking for something edible. Then in a few minutes they were joined by several other crows, so that there were now six or eight of the birds crossing over Norbeck Road, Maryland 28, toward the big golf course to south and east of the intersection. Then still other crows joined them, so that nine birds were now gliding high in the air above the golf course. Then they crossed to the west over Layhill Road and were circling directly in back of me.\n\nIn curiosity, I turned to watch, thinking, \"I wonder if they've spotted something dead to eat. \" And then, for a second, I wondered if possibly they might be waiting to peck at me. I hadn't moved much in half an hour, and as I stood on the median strip I might have looked from the air like roadkill. I also was wearing a green khaki cap of a kind often sported by hunters and fishermen, which may have reminded this convocation of crows — highly social animals, with long memories that researchers have documented — of some nasty human who once killed one of their friends. Crows apparently don't forget these things.\n\nTaking off my fisherman's cap, therefore, and trying not to think of Hitchcock's horror movie *The Birds,* I waved in air in the crows' direction, then walked a few steps down the median strip and back. In a minute or two, all the crows silently drifted back across Layhill and disappeared behind some trees. I felt a little odd about this.\n\nMy bright red Bernie shirt attracted more than the crows that afternoon, though. As I stood there on the median strip, an affluent-looking older white man driving a Lexus and sporting a bushy mustache that made him resemble the rich banker pictured on the Monopoly cards pulled up beside me and rolled down his window. \"I'm for Bernie,\" he said proudly. \"I've contributed to his campaign – twice.\" He smiled and held up two fingers. \"Even though\" – his voiced dropped meaningfully and trailed off.\n\n\"Yeah, in Maryland he's facing an uphill battle,\" I said. \"But supporting him means you're sending *them* a message.\" The guy with the mustache nodded, rolled up his window, and made the light.\n\nA few minutes later I heard a beep behind me and a white man in his 40s driving a pickup truck, a man whose cargo and paint job suggested he was a landscaper, leaned out his window and yelled \"Feel the Bern!\" He gave me a big grin and a thumbs up sign, which I returned. \"Right on!\" I yelled, and he too disappeared.\n\nA bit later still – my ride was having difficulty getting away from the local canvass office – a white woman in her early forties, who was acting almost furtively, as if she were doing something naughty, rolled down her car window and declared from a lane over in the intersection, \"I'm voting for Bernie in the Tuesday primary!\" Then she rolled off, looking quite pleased with herself but a little guilty about transgressing some personal psychological boundary.\n\nFor me, it's the pleasure of small moments like these that have made canvassing for Bernie this season a lot more enjoyable than I expected it to be when I signed up for it. We all know — from DSA Activist emails, from endless appeals by Maria Svart, and from high school civics classes, too — that as Americans in a supposedly democratic society, we \"should\" do the nuts and bolts work of engaging in local political activism. As socialists and/or progressives, we know we \"should\" sign up to leaflet outside the polls on election day, hand out literature to potential voters, take part in worthy petition drives, reach out to minority and low-income communities, join union picket lines, host progressive house parties and so forth.\n\nAs leftists, a militant minority of us probably share the view of the English poet William Wordsworth, who in a famous ode described \"Duty\" as \"Stern Daughter of the Voice of God.\" Others on the wider left may agree with Nietzsche about local activism representing the \"will to power\" in action, whether for good or ill. But what's often forgotten, as we uneasily ponder the immense personal sacrifices that committed socialists must supposedly make for the class struggle, is that some grassroots political work — including getting out the vote – can be fun.\n\nI don't want to be guilty of stupid exaggeration about how much fun I had getting out the Bernie vote in Aspen Hills on April 23. It's a relatively high-income area, and I saw several yard signs for conservative Democratic candidates in the big front yards, and there some moments in the day that I found discouraging. I talked to one allegedly Democratic voter with a giant American flag in his yard and a hatred of the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, who thinks Hillary is a crook, Bernie is crazy and Trump makes a lot of sense. He indicated that he hates Obama, too, and while he did allow me to sit on his front porch and rest my feet after several hours walking, his ideas of what a \"sensible\" Democratic Party should be nearly made me despair.\n\nBut I really did enjoy seeing the deer and talking to the pro-Bernie drivers at the intersection, and in retrospect I appreciate my odd experience with the crows, now that it has ended well. And there were other, more substantial pleasures to be had from Aspen Hills canvassing as well. One favorite moment was when I knocked at a door shortly after talking to the conservative Democrat with the flag and the attitude and it was answered by a middle-aged man who said, \"My wife, my son and I all will be voting for Bernie on Tuesday. Thanks for the work you're doing.\"\n\nAnother good moment was when a woman in her fifties answered the door and said her husband I was hoping to talk to wasn't home and that she couldn't support Bernie in the primary, because she was a registered Republican. She couldn't say if he was a registered Democrat or not. But she thanked me for the Bernie door hanger and hoped I could stay dry, and it was raining at that time in the morning. \"Speaking of staying dry, could I use your bathroom?\" I asked. Sure, she replied, but please give her a moment so she could be sure it was clean. As I was leaving the house a few minutes later, she said one good thing Bernie had done was improve the quality of debate on the Democratic side.\n\n\"I won't say anything about the quality of the Republican debate,\" she added a bit tartly. We commiserated for a few minutes over the prospect of a Trump or a Cruz presidency, and after we each wished the other well I walked on.\n\nAt another Aspen Hills house, in mid-afternoon, the door was answered by a short, stocky man in his forties whose biceps looked as swollen as a weightlifter's. He had blue tattoos along his arms and shoulders beneath an Under Armor tank top. \"You must be here for Ricky,\" he grinned as he eyed my Bernie shirt. \"You're definitely not here for me.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I am here for Ricky,\" I said. He yelled for his son to come to the door and the son and I had an enthusiastic conversation about Bernie, so enthusiastic I marked him down as a possible Bernie volunteer. \"Do you have a phone number where we can reach you?\" I asked the son. He said he might as well give me the landline number for the house.\n\n\"If I answer the phone, I'll probably tell you he isn't home,\" his father joked. The three of us smiled at each other and I congratulated them for having a family where they could tolerate political differences, and we actually exchanged a few words about runaway technology under capitalism before I left.\n\nAt another Aspen Hills house there was the rich odor of exotic cooking inside when I knocked on the door at noon. A very nice Ethiopian immigrant woman in her twenties who answered said she was definitely committed to Hillary, but she said it with a smile; we both agreed that Trump needed to be kept out of the Oval Office.\n\nAt another house there was an electric car parked in the garage sporting a bumper stick that said, \"This is what the end of gasoline looks like.\" The man inside and his wife both seemed to be Hillary supporters, but it was their teenaged son who was on my list, and all three listened with interest to my spiel for Bernie. Eventually the son, a high school senior taking an honors AP course in history, said he really didn't have enough information to cast an informed vote yet and needed to do some serious online research in the few days remaining before the primary to make his choice. It was exactly what I would have wanted a son of mine to say under the circumstances, although I was sad to lose a possible vote for Bernie. I congratulated him and his parents for being honest and intellectually serious before taking my leave.\n\nI'm only one of several local DSA members I know personally who have done serious canvassing and get out the vote work for the Sanders campaign over the past half year. I can't speak for the experience of the others, who've include most the old guard activists on the Steering Committee as well as four highly dedicated younger members and David Duhalde, who now works for the national office. Several of the younger members have genuinely worked as organizers for DSA's Bernie work, scheduling regular canvassing events in the District, organizing a march for Bernie attended by local college students, assisting in the organizing of debate watch parties and the like. But I've confined my work to individual volunteering, mostly in the form of leafleting and door-to-door GOTV efforts. For me, human interactions like those I've outlined above make leafleting and GOTV work especially rewarding.\n\nThe weekend before three of us in the Metro DC chapter joined the National Nurses Union in getting out the vote for Bernie in Montgomery County, which is the event that involved me with door-to-door canvassing in Aspen Hill, our local co-chair Carolyn Byerly organized at least half a dozen DSA members in handing out DSA literature for the Bern in the Maryland suburbs. On that weekend I and a new DSA supporter distributed flyers and fact sheets for Bernie near the Silver Spring metro station, and it was a very different ambiance from that I discovered in Aspen Hills.\n\nIn Silver Spring it was mostly a matter of handing literature to people on the street, or in a few cases to local street vendors. There wasn't nearly as much walking and the work went faster, partly because a big fraction of those we encountered were already enthusiastic about Bernie. That was gratifying. However, my favorite moment of the day came when I approached a small group of black and Hispanic teenaged guys hanging out at Veterans Plaza near the Silver Spring Civic Center. When I handed them some DSA flyers on Bernie, including national DSA's new fact sheet on Bernie's record on racial justice issues, they were enthusiastic.\n\n\"Hey, man, could I have some of these to hand out?\" one of them asked. \"I think I could use them to meet some girls.\" Another of the group asked to help me and the other DSA volunteer in distributing our other flyers to people at the Plaza, and did very well at it. Closer to the Civic Center, where early voting for the primary was occurring that day, I talked to a campaign worker for a local progressive Democratic candidate for Congress who was extremely interested in DSA's history, current membership and structure, and said she might be very interested in attending local DSA meetings once her work for the candidate is concluded for the year. Also staffing a table outside the Civic Center that Saturday was the head of the Montgomery County Democratic Party, who said he was delighted to see us working for Bernie, since Bernie's candidacy has sparked such involvement by younger voters in Democratic politics.\n\nI got a different kind of enjoyment still from doing individual volunteering for the official Bernie campaign in Virginia in the last few days leading up to the Virginia primary. The two high points of my GOTV volunteering in Arlington were probably some extremely polite and civil exchanges I had with Trump supporters in one middle-class neighborhood, on the one hand, and on the other hand walking into a popular Italian restaurant nearby and having the cashier and the guys behind the sandwich counter both make favorable remarks about Bernie's candidacy and my tee shirt advertising it.\n\nThe next two days, while doing individual volunteering for the GOTV effort in Alexandria, I found myself visiting lower-income apartment complexes a few miles from King Street. When I knocked at the door of one second-floor apartment, the old woman who answered spoke more Chinese than English and was having a hard time remembering things, including the new phone number of her son, who was the Democratic voter I was supposed to canvass. Nevertheless she invited me in and had me sit on her sofa while she rummaged in her effects for her phonebook, and when she finally called him he assured her, and me, that he was a strong Bernie fan and would be voting in the primary.\n\nIn another apartment complex in the same neighborhood, a young Latino man was repairing a motorcycle on the landing outside of his mother's apartment and waved me through an open door when I asked to speak to her. His mother, too, seemed to speak very little English, but her daughter translated for her and after a somewhat lengthy conversation she decided that yes, she would vote for Bernie in the primary, as all the other candidates running were only representing the rich. At still another address in Alexandria the young white man who was on my list to canvass said of course he was for Bernie, but he actually believed in a more radical socialist vision. We then had a longish exchange about Marxism, capitalism and socialism before I'd gotten enough of a break from constant walking to want to move on.\n\nI've read a good deal of radical literature over the course of my life, although never in a disciplined way, yet there is something about encountering real people through political work for Bernie this election season that I find enormously exciting. Somehow, it represents a step far beyond what I've picked up in the way of pure socialist theory. There's a buzz to be had, a high you can experience from talking to people in this way, and I can easily see why some activists find it addictive. I'm hoping it makes me a better socialist over time. For now, though, I'm sure it's making me a happier one.","order":3},{"title":"The Team that Dare Not Speak Its Name","date":"2016-04-30","issue":"April 2016","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Review of *Redskins: Insult and Brand*. By C. Richard King. University of Nebraska Press, 2016. 256 pp.\n\nWhen the Cleveland Indians last month announced that they would [*miminize the use of their Chief Wahoo logo*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/04/03/cleveland-indians-have-officially-demoted-the-chief-wahoo-logo/) – the idiotically grinning Native American stereotype that disgraced the players' caps and sleeves – the campaign to eliminate Native names, logos and imagery from sports took a baby step forward – sort of. The Indians removed the Wahoo image from caps, replacing it with a block C, but the face still smirks from the players' sleeves, and the team will continue to sell Wahoo paraphernalia. By trying to be only a little bit racist, the club satisfied no one. But the move did show that the growing movement to eliminate Native stereotyping in sports is being heard, if not always heeded.\n\nThe fact that the Cleveland club was doing a little something put the spotlight back on the sports team engaging in the most egregious and offensive appropriation of Native symbols and verbiage – Washington, D.C.'s professional football team, whose name is the slur in the title of C. Richard King's timely and valuable new book. King examines the battle over the club's name and the campaign to eliminate names and imagery insulting to Natives from sports in general. While the dictionary-defined slur that is at the heart of the controversy appears in the books title, in the text itself King substitutes an asterisk for the \"e\" in most uses so as not to repeat the insult.\n\nKing, a professor of comparative ethnic studies at Washington State University, makes clear from the beginning which side he is on. \"*Redskin* is a problem,\" he writes. \"It is an outdated reference to an American Indian. It is best regarded as a racial slur on par with other denigrating terms.\"\n\nKing examines the Washington team's name, and Native names and imagery in sports in general, through a lens of the white privilege that has made it acceptable to degrade and stereotype minorities for fun and profit – that is, until the minorities fight back. While African Americans and Latinos have had a large measure of success at removing demeaning stereotypes of themselves from popular culture and advertising (gone are \"Sambo's\" and the \"Frito Bandito\"), Native Americans, due to their smaller population and isolation, have had a tougher battle. But, as King amply notes, they are making progress.\n\nKing explores the history of the Washington team's name, and finds the official backstory fails to hold water. Owner Daniel Snyder claims that the team, formerly located in Boston and nicknamed the Braves, was renamed in 1932 by its new coach William \"Lone Star\" Dietz who was said to be of Lakota heritage. Therefore, said Snyder, the name \"was, and continues to be, a badge of honor.\" But King explodes that myth, finding that Dietz was in fact of German heritage and claimed Native ancestry likely due to the early 20<sup>th</sup> century \"nationalist zeal for authentic Indianness and the popularity of playing Indian.\" Dietz, in fact, tried to evade the draft during World War I by calling himself a \"non-citizen Indian,\" a claim that was deemed fraudulent by the FBI and led to his spending a month in jail.\n\nThe real story behind the name seems more straightforward. The change in the team's nickname coincided with its move from Braves Field to Fenway Park, and seems to have been largely what we today would call a \"branding\" decision, both to call attention to the new venue and distinguish the team from the baseball franchise also called the Boston Braves. The new name, which traveled to Washington with the team's relocation in 1937, was similar to the old one but just different enough, and owner George Preston Marshall had no compunction against adopting a name that stereotyped and demeaned Natives. Marshall's team, King notes, was the last in the NFL to sign African American players, and not until 1962 when it was pressured to do so by the federal government.\n\nThe origin of the word \"Redskin\" itself is even murkier, with various sources linking it to war paint once used by some tribes, and others to the bloody scalps of Natives collected when colonial governments put a price on their heads. But there is no question that as Western settlement advanced and Natives were driven from their land, the word increasingly became recognized as a slur.\n\nThe popularity of Native team names, logos and imagery, King effectively shows, is bound up in white America's contradictory and changing views of the country's original inhabitants. While in the 19<sup>th</sup> century Natives were often viewed as little better than pests that, along with the bison, needed to be exterminated or at least removed to where whites would not have to encounter them, by the 20<sup>th</sup> century – when most remaining natives lived on remote reservations – it became safe to view them through the lens of nostalgia. \"It was,\" King writes, \"a paradoxical love of imagined Indians and a loathing of actual, embodied Indians that continues to this day.\" Native names and imagery made a transition from denoting savagery to hearkening back to a time of simplicity and bravery, to the \"noble warrior.\" The traditions of disparate nations – feathered headdresses, tomahawks, teepees, totem poles – were lumped together to create a single, generic \"Indian,\" more a fictional character and a childhood game than a real, breathing human being. And, of course, a sports mascot.\n\nOne of King's more valuable insights is how Native team names and mascots stem from the white man's desire to dominate and appropriate Native culture. \"Native Americans,\" King writes, \"are not unlike trophies, remnants from a kill, longingly kept reminders of past glory, and continuing signs of the prowess and superiority through which Euro-Americans channel the strength and energy of those they . . .have vanquished.\"\n\nFor decades, Native Americans – and their non-native allies – have fought back against the hurtful stereotyping of their images and traditions. As early as 1972, Native advocates pressured the Washington team on its derogatory nickname. More recently, lawsuits have challenged the team's ability to trademark merchandise bearing a \"disparaging name;\" the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office ruled against the team, which is appealing the decision. Native organizations such as Change the Mascot and Not Your Mascots have kept up the heat on the Washington team while convincing many college and high school teams to change their names; while most of these teams did not have a nickname as offensive as the Washington club, their uses of Native symbols and stereotypes remained offensive and insulting. A November 2014 demonstration in Minneapolis, where Washington was playing the Vikings, took the demand for a name change directly to the team. Non-natives also are joining the cause of changing the Washington team's name; many prominent sports journalists, including ESPN's Mike Wise and NBC's Bob Costas, have been outspoken on the issue. And in Washington, a grassroots organization, [*Rebrand Washington Football (RWF*](http://www.rebrandwf.org/)), has been conducting a petition and informational campaign to change the name; King includes quotes from RWF co-founders Ian Washburn and Josh Silver in his book. (Full disclosure: the writer of this article is a member of RWF).\n\nThe book marshals a wealth of evidence showing why the Washington team's name in particular, and most Native names and mascots generally, should be changed. Unfortunately, King too often resorts to academic jargon to get his point across, and the book can be dense at times. King also could have benefitted from tighter editing: He repeats information and ideas throughout the book, such as the team's origin in Boston, the heritage of \"Lone Star\" Dietz, and the team's use of the offensive \"Little Indian\" image. He also restates the notion of real vs. imagined Indians in a number of different places and different ways.\n\nKing offers only hints to two questions on readers' minds: Why does Snyder cling so tenaciously to the name in the face of protests and criticism, and what will it take to bring about change? King cites Snyder's childhood as a fan of the team and his fondness for everything connected to it, but the real answer is more likely the man's stubbornness and willful refusal to be told by outsiders what to do. Now that he has dug himself in on the name, dislodging him will be doubly difficult. Nevertheless, King suggests a number of possible wedges that might separate him from the name, such as his desire for a new stadium in DC coupled with the District government's stated unwillingness to let him bring the name with him. An unfavorable final outcome to the trademark case could be an impetus, as well as growing recognition among fans that the team's name and symbols are stigmatized by racism. If nothing else, someday Snyder will no longer own the team and the new owner or owners will be able to look at the issue with fresh eyes. But advocates hope it won't take that long, and continued pressure and public education are the sometimes slow but necessary steps toward forcing the team to change. King's book provides valuable ammunition that might help bring about that change sooner rather than later.\n\n[*This Pie is Not in the Sky: How Idealism Moves Reality*](http://dsadc.org/this-pie-is-not-in-the-sky-how-idealism-moves-reality/)\n\nSaturday, April 30th, 2016\n\n**Progressives don't know their cultural history, while the Right Wing has capitalized the power of idealism **\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;* May 2016**\n\n*By Jessie Mannisto*\n\nWe're hearing the phrase \"pie in the sky\" tossed around a lot these days. Center-left readers of respectable news sources—the type that have compared Bernie's proposed policies to [*unicorns*](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/16/my-unicorn-problem/) and [*puppies with lottery tickets tied to their tails*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/16/us/politics/left-leaning-economists-question-cost-of-bernie-sanderss-plans.html)—often note that as tasty as that pie sounds, there is an election coming up and they're on a diet.\n\nIt's ironic to compare a socialist crusader's proposals to some sort of celestial pastry, as it was the radical labor leader and songwriter [*Joe Hill*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hill), a [*Wobbly*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World), who [*coined*](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/pie-in-the-sky.html) the phrase \"pie in the sky.\" Hill (who later became a martyr when he was executed for a crime of which he was likely innocent, but I digress) wrote a song called \"[*The Preacher and the Slave*](http://www.folkarchive.de/pie.html)\" to the tune of a hymn associated with the Salvation Army, \"In the Sweet Bye and Bye.\" [*Utah Phillips*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Phillips) will [*sing it for you*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ236CwhlPw):\n\nOr if you'd prefer to stick with text, here's the first verse and chorus:\n\n*Long-haired preachers come out every night, Try to tell you what's wrong and what's right; But when asked how 'bout something to eat They will answer with voices so sweet:*\n\nCHORUS: *You will eat, bye and bye, In that glorious land above the sky (Way up high!) Work and pray, live on hay, You'll get pie in the sky when you die. (That's a lie!)*\n\nWhen Hill sang of pie in the sky, he was attacking what he believed was an imaginary reward intended to tranquilize the otherwise volatile masses. The Salvation Army's decision to worry more about souls than about hunger here on Earth infuriated him. \"Pie in the sky\" is an insult directed at that sort of nebulous promise that one day things will finally be great if you just fall in line and believe what the powerful are telling you.\n\nThat's definitely *not* a criticism that fits Bernie Sanders.\n\nMost other wealthy nations have baked the very pies Bernie's proposing. Things like universal health care, paid sick leave, and publicly funded college can and do work. The task now at hand is convincing policymakers, current and future, that we can smell the pie and would very much like a slice.\n\n*And there's the rub!* say too many who otherwise support these policies. *We could never convince our leaders that they should support such radical plans!* If you don't actually support these progressive goals yourself, that's one thing; I'm not talking to you here, and I don't consider liberal opinion disseminators like Nicholas Kristof and his ilk progressive allies after articles like the one [*I criticized*](https://counternarration.wordpress.com/2016/02/07/nyts-kristof-spreads-wall-street-austerians-fud/) last month. (Perhaps these folks have themselves used these goals as their own sky pie to herd the masses along and are now alarmed that we're actually serious about them. I dunno, I don't hang out in their circles.) But many people who I know actually support these policies nevertheless are convinced we live in a country of ever-ascendant right-wingers and see no room or reason even to try.\n\nThis is not only wrong (see, for instance [*a February poll by Vox*](http://www.vox.com/2016/2/3/10904988/bernie-sanders-political-revolution-poll) suggesting broad support for Bernie's proposals); it's also dangerous defeatism. And parsing the success of those very right wingers who scare us so much shows us why.\n\n\n\n**The \"Overton Window\"**\n\nA central concept underlying the growth of the plutocratic deregulating antidemocratic movement is the [*Overton Window*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window). This bit of political theory comes from the [*Mackinac Center for Public Policy*](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Mackinac_Center_for_Public_Policy), which SourceWatch describes as a right-wing pressure group established by activists seeking to promote free market, pro-business policies. What they called the Overton Window, after one of the think tank's vice presidents, refers to the small section of the overall range of all conceivable policies, from one extreme to the other, that are deemed acceptable by mainstream voters and that, therefore, a politician can support and still survive the next election. The image shown here above gives you an example of what this means. If you shift the position or size of the window, represented in teal in the graphic, you change what is politically possible.\n\nThis is what the Right has been doing over the past few decades. With funding from the Koch Brothers and Michigan plutocrats, the Mackinac Center has normalized and pushed ideas that would have been seen as crazy not so long ago.\n\nAnd look at what the Right's version of idealism has achieved. Not so long ago, the goal of making Michigan—*Michigan!* We named a freeway after [*Walter Reuther*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reuther)!—a Right-to-Work-For-Less state would have been considered among the most egregious of celestial pastries. The Emergency Manager law that brought us the suspension of democracy that led to the poisoning of Flint represent another realization of the Right's wildest dreams.I'm sure you can think of plenty of other noxious right-wing pies, but I'll stop before I depress everyone. The point is, Republicans haven't sat there and said, gee, we'd like to do this, but people aren't on our side. They went out there and shifted the window of discourse.\n\nI'd wager that the Right's willingness to champion their goals has even helped mobilize their voters, giving them a reason to get excited and come out to vote in midterm elections. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, has hunkered down and trembled under the banner of \"no, we can't,\" trying to position itself as a defender of a status quo in which many voters, including plenty of moderates, see cracks.\n\nBernie Sanders's campaign has already been a tremendous success, because he's opened the Overton Window on the left. Progressive economic goals are now back inside of it. But this won't go any further without a fight, and I'm not talking about the one with the Right. I'm talking about the alumni of the [*Democratic Leadership Council*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Leadership_Council) and their elite allies — the ones who closed the left side of the Overton Window in the 1990s — who are telling us that economically progressive goals are forever out of reach. No, we can't.\n\n****** Radical labor leader Joe Hill, who coined the phrase \"pie in the sky\"**\n\nMore than anyone in national politics today, Bernie stands for the same ordinary working Americans for whom Joe Hill wrote his songs. Bernie understands that there needs to be a real fight to make the system work for all of us. Our detractors who fancy themselves pragmatists tell us that, y'know, Bernie's not going to be able to implement all these changes. (I wonder if they think a Republican Congress is going to go along with Hillary Clinton, but I digress.)\n\nWe know that. But we also know that each vote for Bernie opens the Overton Window a little further. If you are for social safety nets, if you want to push for an economy whose benefits are accessible to all, if you think banks that are too big to fail are too big to exist, if you're impatient waiting for cautious politicians to recognize the rights of oppressed minorities, if you are embarrassed that our country is the only major industrialized country that doesn't mandate paid family leave or sick time, et cetera, then voting for Bernie is at present is one great way to show that.\n\nIt can't be the only way. We need a movement, much like the one described recently in [*an excellent article*](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/miles-mogulescu/time-to-transform-bernies_b_9547060.html) in the Huffington Post. And hey, if you're a progressive for Hillary, we still would love to welcome you on board; I know you have your reasons to support her in 2016, and that's cool. Just don't believe anyone who tries to tell you what can and cannot be. And if they bring up celestial pastry, perhaps they'd be interested in the story of a Wobbly named Joe Hill.\n\n*This* pie is real. It can be done, no matter what the comfortable elites at *The New York Times* want you to believe. They're the ones who are really promising pie in the sky, in the original sense of the term.\n\nSing with me now!\n\n*Pay your loans, bye and bye,* *With that glorious job in the sky.

There was even a brief period – between the US withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973 and our invasion of Grenada in 1983 – when the military's hand was stayed in circumstances which would now elicit drones or ground troops or mercenaries. Such days are long gone, our country now engaged in what amounts to endless war, bringing death and destruction around the world without even a pretense that these will ever cease. The change didn't just happen, the militarization of our economy and culture are part and parcel of the corporate neo-liberal assault on democracy and workers rights.\n\nThere was also a time, in the not too distant past, when the dominant leadership of US unions cheered wars as a source of jobs, as a way to \"prove\" a patriotism often called into question by business interests. And such support had adherents amongst rank-and-file unionists at a time when US capitalism appeared to offer opportunities not known elsewhere. Although there was always more working-class and union opposition to war than official mythology would have us believe, it is also undeniable that those resisting the siren call of the battlefield have generally been a minority – especially before the body bags start piling up. Yet this is no longer the case, the AFL-CIO in its majority has spoken out against war, and in so doing has expressed sentiments of rank-and-file members. This too, didn't just happen, it came about as a result of conscious work by union activists who sought to democratize the labor movement and widen its vision to better combat the destructiveness of unbridled corporate power at home and around the world.\n\nAlthough not a central part of either campaign, Clinton's hawkishness has made clear that her support for the invasion of Iraq was no accident, has made clear her readiness to continue to assert US military power abroad no matter the cost in human life or social well-being. Sanders, by contrast, in his opposition to the Iraq war, his willingness to speak of Palestinians as human beings who have suffered injustices, his inclusion of climate change and corporate free trade pacts as foreign policy issues, has sharpened the distinctions between the two of them. The political revolution Sanders has spoken of, is connected to the question implied above — are we a country of war or a country of peace?\n\n**Talks**\n\nThese themes were in the background of DSA's March 21 Socialist Salon which featured two USLAW – US Labor Against War – co-conveners: Brooks Sunkett, Senior Vice President for Public Workers, Health and Education for CWA – and Bob Muhlenkamp, former Executive Vice President and Director of Organizing for SEIU-1199, and Director of Organizing for the Teamsters during its brief period under reform leadership. USLAW is a union organization, financed by affiliated locals across the country that recognize the connection between the labor's domestic issues and the struggles for peace and justice workers are engaged in around the world. USLAW'S National Assembly held in Washington DC the weekend of March 19-20 provided a forum to analyze the global issues confronting working people today and a place to strategize on how to forge stronger connections between social and economic justice initiatives with the peace movement.\n\nSunkett began the Salon reminding participants that working people are the first to suffer in war, recalling his own experience as a soldier in Vietnam while still a teenager. That experience – what he and his fellow GIs endured, the suffering they witnessed being inflicted on the Vietnamese people – scarred him but also gave him an understanding of the world which he subsequently brought to his work as a union activist and leader. He explained that what he observed and felt during that war was in his mind when he introduced a resolution developed by USLAW at the 2005 AFL-CIO Convention condemning the US war against Iraq. The resolution – passed without opposition – marked the first time a US labor federation condemned an on-going war. The broad backing for the resolution was built upon the heritage of unionists who opposed the war in Vietnam, then, a decade later, opposed US intervention in Central America and US support for South African apartheid. USLAW was able to come to the Convention having already garnered support from state and municipal labor federations, as well as from union locals and regional organizations for the resolution Sunkett introduced. It was the prior work of organizing that created the basis for this historic anti-war measure.\n\nBut not that alone. Sunkett noted that USLAW also organized tours of US unionists to Iraq and of Iraqi unionists to the US – tours which brought out the common interests of working people in both countries, making solidarity more concrete by giving it a human face. Mutual opposition to the war machine was also due to the shared public consequence for war not only brings death and destruction, it also distorts the economy by taking investments out of socially useful production and undermines social spending because massive arms expenditures takes money away from public needs. This led Sunkett to speak of an initiative CWA developed and outlined in a brochure: *Building a Movement for Economic Justice and Democracy*. The Communications Workers of America demonstrates in those pages the linkage between the growth of inequality in society to the successful decades-long corporate assault on organized labor. That linkage, in turn, provides the basis for an appeal to progressive and civic organizations from all walks of life and communities to work together to repair our broken political democracy. It is a logic consistent with the platform put forward by Bernie Sanders, and consistent with that CWA endorsed Sanders for president – an endorsement was based upon the democratic participation of union members, in a process Sunkett explained. Running as a thread in his remarks was the need to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision to equate corporate money with free speech. This, Sunkett stressed, is not simply needed to limit the direct power of big money in elections, it is needed to end the distorting power of the 1% in all phases of our society – including that of the arms industry and military establishment.\n\nMuhlenkamp took up that theme when describing his work helping organize the massive 1982 Nuclear Freeze march in New York at the height of war tensions fueled by Ronald Reagan's nuclear weapons build-up. At the time Muhlenkamp was an officer of 1199, a groundbreaking hospital workers union that had made an enormous difference in the lives of its members. Leon Davis, the founder and then president of the union said, however, that all the gains working people had made through hard fought struggle could be wiped out in an instance if work broke out. It was a reminder that unionists had to break out of their own silos, their own narrow focus on only what lies immediately before them, for labor rights can't exist without peace.\n\nBringing this sensibility back to the present, he then recounted his trip last month to Vietnam and Cambodia, countries that are still living with the destruction caused by the rain of bombs our government dropped on them during that long war. Yet despite the environmental and human loss, the people of those countries are looking forward toward building a future, a reminder that we should do so as well. Yet, Muhlenkamp added, there is one figure for whom forgiveness should impossible, and that is Henry Kissinger – the architect of war policies during the Nixon Administration who unleashed a blood bath Christmas 1972 simply to demonstrate US power at a time when the US government was already preparing to withdraw from the conflict.\n\nThe significance of that for today is that Hilary Clinton has referred to Kissinger as a man whom she respects and from whom she has learned. And what those lessons amount to can be gleaned from a *New York Times* article (\"How Hillary Clinton Became a Hawk\"[*http://nyti.ms/1WH99LV*](http://nyti.ms/1WH99LV)) that speaks to her intimate associations with military contractors and arms manufacturers — wielding the kind of influence she pretends does not exist with her Wall Street financial backers. A symmetry between military power, corporate power and anti-unionism Muhlenkamp noted, was on full display in Iraq – for the first action taken by the US occupation authorities after Baghdad was conquered was to ban public sector unions. Oil fields and most industry had been nationalized in Iraq, so this action was effectively a US ban on the country's unions.\n\nSuch connections, in turn, led Muhlenkamp to speak of the importance of the political alternative the Sanders campaign has opened, an alternative which, importantly, has allowed socialism to re-enter our country's political discourse. That said, and notwithstanding the clear difference between Sanders and Clinton on issues of war and peace, Bernie's campaign has focused on domestic issues. Muhlenkamp suggested that this is a reflection of a change in society which was also discussed at the just-concluded USLAW assembly.\n\nYoung people – the millennials – have grown up in a time of on-going war, with the consequence that war has become virtually normalized as an inevitable part of our modern world. Moreover, the stagnating economy combined with growing poverty has meant that a career in the military is one of the few avenues open to young people who want to break free from the limitations that surround them. So whereas ROTC – the Reserve Officers' Training Corp – was kicked off one college campus after another in the late 1960s and early 1970s, they have made a huge comeback not only at universities but even high schools. USLAW recognized that this is a reality which the anti-war movement has to take into account. So it is passing the reins to a new generation, one less marked by the Vietnam War, but instead is attuned to today's realities.\n\n**Discussion and Reflections**\n\nRealities that have found expression in the Sanders' campaign, the support he has received amongst young people itself providing a bridge from struggles of the past to today while expressing an energy, a hopefulness and an openness that will be needed if the opportunity now before us is ceased. Much of the discussion after the presentations focused on Sanders, not only his candidacy but those running for Senate and House seats, those running for local offices.\n\nThe Maryland primaries held but a few days later were a reminder of how much more need be done – for not only did Sanders lose in the state, but so too did many of those running on an anti-corporate platform akin to his. And although there were some bright spots, such as Jamie Raskin's victory, there were more defeats, including those of Joseline Pena-Melnyk and Donna Edwards by establishment Democrat candidates, that were especially painful. Edwards loss in particular was a loss that spoke to systemic opposition to independence, that racial and gender representation is only allowed to tokens beholden to those above rather than their constituencies. All of which were predictable and all of which touched on questions raised at the Salon – most pointedly that posed back to participants by Sunkett asking what each would do if Clinton not Sanders is the eventual nominee of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe answers varied from person to person, yet the agreement expressed lay in the need to continue to organize, to continue to address the issues behind the broad support for Sanders. This was on display during the Awakening Democracy/Rally for Democracy actions the week before, simultaneous with USLAW's Assembly. Alongside direct action civil disobedience with arrests of over 1,000 there was congressional lobbying; alongside workshops to encourage civic engagement and knowledge there was a public rally at the Capital Building. The twinned themes of all were the need to end the corrupting role of money in politics and the need to defend and expand voting rights. The expression for the need for such change was the need for environmental protection, an end to anti-LBGT laws, for immigrant rights, an end to gun violence, support for peace not war.\n\nAnd, just as at our Salon, the voice of labor was heard – especially in the presence of members of the Amalgamated Transit Union embroiled locally in conflicts with our Metro system; and in the presence of leaders and members of CWA now in the midst of a 39,000 member strike. Sunkett spoke of the strike, the issues workers were facing and called on everyone to join the picket lines and give financial assistance to those who walked off the job rather than give in to the concessionary demands of business. People at the meeting opened their pockets to contribute – demonstrating in action that the movements for peace and for social and economic justice are all different aspects of the same demand for a genuine democracy – aka — socialism.","order":5},{"title":"W[","date":"2016-04-30","issue":"April 2016","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"**Perspective**\n\nBernie Sanders likely will not get the nomination, nor win the presidency. But that doesn't mean that his campaign was in vain. Rather the work done serves as a reminder that organizing to improve conditions of life in our own communities when joined to a vision of social solidarity can sustain struggles over the long haul – and can sometimes even surprise us with a victory. What follows is a description of just such efforts undertaken to stop Walmart expansion in Prince George's County.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nGood neighbors are trustworthy, good neighbors take care of their own houses or apartments and lend a hand to those around them when help is needed. By any such definition, Walmart has been a bad neighbor to communities across the country. One doesn't have far to go to discover instances of such; an example can be found in Prince George's County's Duvall Village. Walmart announced in 2013 its intention to put a 24-hour store in a small community. Residents, concerned about safety, environmental damage, and a further hit to property values in an area that still hasn't recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, organized opposition. Walmart countered with the alleged economic benefits of the store. But that myth was countered when neighborhood activists cited statistics revealing that Walmart destroys three jobs for every two it creates (by causing layoffs or store closings in existing businesses unable to compete), and underpays its workforce (half of its employees earn less than $25,000 per year). The weight of such evidence, backed by public meetings, public hearings and a signature campaign, contributed to a decision by the Prince George's County Council – exercising its land use capacity authority while wearing its District County hat – to vote unanimously in 2015 to deny Walmart's application. That decision should have ended matters but Walmart lived up to its reputation of not caring about the opinions of communities; it appealed the Council's decision, showing a complete lack of respect for the residents of Duvall Village. The Court hearing was held on April 22, residents waiting to see if the victory they thought they won is protected or if they will have to resume their organizing.\n\nMeanwhile, a new battle is looming. Walmart's treatment of its own property and the property surrounding its Capital Plaza store over the past decade has demonstrated the lack of respect to the entire Prince George's County community that Duvall Village residents feared. And that record of bad behavior is the reason for local opposition to Walmart's proposed expansion at the Capital Plaza site it has occupied for nearly a decade.\n\nWalmart elicits such opposition because it operates on a business model opposed to any accountability to customers, to employees, to communities. Thus it has no compunction to break promises made, as recently witnessed in DC where Walmart announced it was not opening two stores in distressed Southeast communities that had been promised as part of an agreement that allowed the company to open stores in three more lucrative neighborhoods. A handshake had sealed the deal – the District government's mistake was banking on Walmart's integrity. At the same time, Walmart announced it was closing hundreds of stores across the country. Business conditions change, consolidation and closing of existing outlets, plants, offices, can happen to any company. But what makes this especially problematic when Walmart is involved is the gap between the jobs and development promised when they go into a community and what they deliver. Their cost-cutting methods of operation drive other businesses out of an area—so when they do shutter their doors they often leave a community worse off than when they entered.\n\n\n\nSuch an outcome flows from an unsustainable business model that pushes costs on those it serves. The low-wage, often part-time jobs Walmart does provide allow its employees little in the way of benefits or possible savings. When a wealthy company acts irresponsibly, taxpayers must bear the burden – as when people with jobs still need subsidized health care, rent assistance, food stamps. After all, one must live even when not earning a living wage. Moreover, that low-wage model undermines the ability of other retailers that want to treat their employees with more justice from doing so, because they can't compete against those low costs. Walmart's refusal to pay its fair share extends beyond its mistreatment of employees to all other areas of business. Unlike responsible companies, its pays for neither security nor groundskeeping – not caring whether these are provided by the local communities, by volunteers, or not at all; just so long as it doesn't come out of their bottom line.\n\n**Forum Talks: Looking Back**\n\nConcerns such as those above lay behind many of the remarks made at Progressive Cheverly's February 4 Forum: *The Proposed Super Walmart at Capital Plaza — is it good for the local community?*Addressing a full house of residents concerned about the possibility of having a \"Super Walmart\" as a neighbor were Cheverly Mayor Mike Callahan; Progressive Maryland Staff Representative Jennifer Dwyer from Duvall Village; Madeline Golde and Clareen Heikal, Progressive Cheverly representatives in the Community Standards Coalition; and Malcolm Augustine, community leader and Progressive Cheverly member. They described Walmart's failure to adequately address past concerns or keep promises once made, and explained the reasons that more space for Walmart will not lead to the economic development area communities want and need. And they concluded with suggestions of actions people can take to ensure that citizen concerns are heard.\n\nPast is prologue was the theme of Heikal and Golde's remarks as they described the background to current concerns over Walmart's plans. Prior to the Capital Plaza Walmart being built in 2007, the property in Landover Hills had been empty for 11 years. Although there was a great deal of interest within the community for retail stores opening at the site, the kind of development Walmart provides did not appear to offer a solution to the lack of local shopping and lack of jobs. Progressive Cheverly helped found the Community Standards Coalition in 2005, with the initial goal to keep Walmart from coming into the area. Once their presence in our area became inevitable, the Coalition established criteria the company needed to meet in order to become a good corporate neighbor – criteria which Walmart has, for the most part, fallen short of. Since putting in the expansion request, they have made some improvements; after 8 years of not being responsive to community concerns these latest actions are likely only being made to weaken opposition to store expansion.\n\nThe Community Standards Coalition – comprised of the Town of Bladensburg, Town of Cheverly, City of College Park, Town of Colmar Manor, Town of Edmonston, City of Glenarden, Greater Landover Knolls Civic Association, City of Hyattsville, Hyattsville Organization for Positive Environment, Landover Area Revitalization, City of Mount Rainier, City of New Carrollton, Port Towns Community Development Corporation, Progressive Cheverly, Radiant Valley Civic Association, Town of Riverdale Park – agreed upon nine goals when first formed. The nine demands are:\n\n-   Prohibition on sale of guns and ammunition.\n\n-   Prohibition on alcohol sales.\n\n-   Provide parking lot security to protect customers and employees.\n\n-   No 24-hour store; hours should be comparable to other retailers in area.\n\n-   Work with community leaders in adjoining neighborhoods to address congestion and security issues.\n\n-   Design a building with attractive façade and landscaping.\n\n-   Establish an energy-efficient and environmentally innovative site.\n\n-   Recruit workers from the area and engage in workforce development.\n\n-   Engage in ongoing dialog with elected municipal and civic association leaders in the area concerning these issues during the duration of the store's operation.\n\nIn addition, the community insisted that Walmart not open up a grocery store at the Capitol Plaza store. Beyond that, the aim was for Walmart to be an anchor store that would lead to the development of the rest of the site; this did not happen. If Walmart gets its way and expands, its larger store and parking lot together will take up a disproportionate share of Capital Plaza's 39 acre lot, thereby inhibiting any other use of the mall. They also typically include a full-service grocery store, which would hurt sales at other local businesses. Walmart has agreed to meet with community representatives, has agreed that the store will not be open 24 hours (a major concern for nearby neighbors), but to ensure that those promises are kept and result in lasting changes means continuing to organize. And so those nine goals remain as goals the Coalition wants Walmart to meet in full.\n\n**Forum Talks: Organizing for a Different Change**\n\nAfter hearing about past conflicts with Walmart, speakers addressed how to work for a better outcome in the present. Dwyer – who led the fight against Walmart in Duvall village — explained that her involvement began after being notified that Walmart wanted to open a store that would be virtually at her front door – a proposal made without any prior consultation or discussion with those who would have to live with the consequences. She took the initiative, talked to her neighbors, and soon discovered that her opposition was shared. Organizing from neighbor to neighbor, doing their own research and so gaining usable knowledge that could be shared, the voice against Walmart's plans grew from one individual to hundreds, leading to the victory – and current court case – described above.\n\nThe experience is relevant to the issues faced at Capital Plaza. The Planning Board is pro-development, pro-Walmart, and is unlikely to give equal weight to community concerns relative to corporate interests. Therefore opponents need to create a body of evidence at the hearing, even if the Planning Board will go along with Walmart's proposal. Although the whole process is constructed as a narrow legal procedure, ultimately it is a political process – and much will rest on the ability of concerned communities to make their feelings known and create a body of evidence at the Planning Board (even if it is ignored) and use that to mobilize and create political pressure on Prince George's County Council.\n\nDwyer was followed by Callahan who reiterated the Town of Cheverly's long-standing support for the Community Standards – and that those nine standards remain the basis of Cheverly's opposition to a Super Walmart at the site. Cheverly's mayor is working with the mayors of Landover Hills (where Capital Plaza is located) and Bladensburg to make development of the entire mall a condition of support for Walmart expansion. Those communities had initially been supportive of Walmart opening up a store, and now feel let down because it is such an eyesore and because it hasn't led to increased local employment opportunities or the shopping expansion promised and anticipated. In meetings with local elected officials and the Coalition, the property owner had claimed Walmart would attract other businesses, but that hasn't happened – though perhaps that is because he has been unwilling to offer the incentives that mall owners typically provide (outside maintenance, financial incentives, work on exterior facades, and the like). If true, it reflects the adoption of a business model similar to that of Walmart – pushing costs onto others that are usually borne by a proprietor.\n\nThis need for real, sustainable development is key, Callahan stressed. What is at issue isn't opposing Walmart per se; rather it is to promote an alternative model of mixed use development, with walkable areas, and several anchors. Such a project is what adjacent and nearby communities want and need.\n\nTo allow for the possibility of such an alternative we need to make our voice heard now, as Augustine stressed in his concluding remarks. Explaining the importance of engagement, he recalled Walmart's underhanded methods of getting its original application for the store approved in 2007. That approval was strongly influenced by a then recent transplant to Cheverly, Phillip Hoffman, who was elected to the town council and was a strong proponent of the economic benefits which would follow if Walmart opened a store in our area. About six months after the application was approved he relocated back to Bentonville, Arkansas where his wife worked as a Walmart Executive Vice President. This is an example of a culture of corporate duplicity and manipulative behavior, of \"win\" at all costs in pursuit of quick dollars symptomatic of the entire process. Neither trust nor honesty are part of Walmart's method of expansion. Only action now can prevent such behavior from being again rewarded, a sentiment that was repeatedly affirmed in the subsequent discussion.\n\n**What is to be Done**\n\nThere are numerous steps that local residents can take in order to resist this expansion. All can speak up and speak out – not as experts (though we have expertise on our side) but as citizens with rights. A broad mobilization is expected for the public Planning Board Hearing which will be held on May 5.\n\nFor more information on this fight and on forms of action Marylanders can take please read a fuller version of this article posted on the Progressive Maryland Blog: *Cheverly Residents, Neighbors, Say \"No,\" to Walmart expansion as May 5 Hearing Nears* by Kurt Stand, April 16, 2016.

He was active in pushing for changes in state law to reduce the exclusionist legal hegemony of the two major parties.\n\nThe *Washington Post*'s obituary reported that Bob \"was a lead plaintiff in a 2003 lawsuit charging the state with discriminating against alternative political parties.

Yet while the Great Depression created a political crisis in Germany that brought the Nazi Party to power, the financial meltdown of 2008 and the \"great recession\" that followed have so far failed to generate a rightwing authoritarian takeover in any leading capitalist country.\n\nThe 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression that followed also spurred the U.S. Congress to pass the notoriously protectionist Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which soon inspired other capitalist powers to adopt extreme tariffs of their own – causing a drastic and ruinous contraction of world trade. Yet since 2008, the leading capitalist governments of Europe, North America and Japan and even the aggressively interventionist government of China have largely tried to coordinate their efforts to stabilize the world economy, although some of their efforts at cooperation have been flawed\n\nDuring the global economic crisis of the 1930s, again, hyper-nationalistic governments in Japan, Germany and Italy pushed the world towards war – seemingly validating Lenin's earlier argument that the \"highest stage of capitalism\" is imperialism, and that it almost inevitably produces war. Yet fortunately, the global economic crisis of 2008-2013 has so far failed to generate serious military competition among leading capitalist nations, and no new global war seems imminent..\n\nWhy hasn't the dog barked in the night? Why is it that while the 2008 financial crash originated in the United States, and while the US Treasury has racked up huge new levels of debt since 2008 while the Federal Reserve Board has been inflating the U.S. dollar, foreign investors and foreign governments are not shunning U.S. Treasury bonds – as many conservative economists expected – but are eagerly buying our bonds instead?\n\nAccording to Canadian labor economists Leo Panitch, long-time editor of *The Socialist Register*, and Sam Gindin, former research director of the Canadian Auto Workers union, the answer is that the U.S. government since the 1930s has successfully worked along with the New York financial sector to stabilize, regulate and dramatically expand the scope of global capitalism as a whole.\n\nTo a degree often unappreciated by the American left, Panitch and Gindin write, a largely informal American empire – resting partly on the global reach of U.S. corporations, but also encompassing a strong U.S. state sector practicing extensive financial and economic regulation – has become critical to the functioning of the entire global capitalist system.\n\nRather than simply serving the narrow interests of U.S. business in expanding American export markets and foreign investment outlets, or even access to important resources like oil, the informal empire has established itself as the best protector of capitalist enterprises everywhere – even those that are potential rivals to American firms.\n\nCiting former Secretary of State Madeline Albright's words, Panitch and Gindin suggest that in terms of global capitalist stability, the United States has in fact become the \"indispensable nation,\" so much so that even such potentially serious rivals as the French, the Japanese and the Chinese are relying on Washington to lead the way out of the current global slump.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, Panitch and Gindin show some striking disagreements with Lenin's analysis in *Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism*, and they also partly reject the argument made by the American revisionist historian William Appleman Williams, in *The Tragedy of American Diplomacy,* about American empire primarily arising in response to U.S. business interests seeking foreign markets as a supposed cure for domestic market gluts.\n\nTheir analysis is likely to be controversial among many supporters of European social democracy and American \"New Deal\" liberalism, too.\n\nEssentially, Panitch and Gindin see New Deal liberalism, higher working class incomes and living standards, and the \"social contract\" that prevailed between American labor unions and American corporations in the immediate postwar period as constituting the main way in which global capitalism recuperated its strength and expanded globally in the aftermath of the 1930s Depression and World War II.\n\nRather than seeking out foreign markets and foreign investment outlets in the colonial world to compensate for glutted markets or working class \"underconsumption\" at home, they believe, global capitalism under American leadership relied on rising working class living standards in the postwar period to provide the capitalists with the markets and the investment opportunities they needed.\n\nPanitch and Gindin therefore consider New Deal liberalism in the United States and the reforms won by European social democracy to be key elements in an ultimately capitalist and globalist project.\n\nSocial democracy and New Deal liberalism both helped to resolve theexplosive economic andpolitical tensions of capitalism that had severely threatened the system in the 1930s, according to the book. Yetthey did so not by empowering the workers or feeding their militancy, but by encouraging working-class consumerism,working class home ownership supported byeffective financial regulationand growing levels of consumer debt, and similarreforms that made it more easierfor western workers — at least until recent decades — to live in a mixed-market economy, rather thanbattling corporations for control ofit.\n\nRather than trying to use the process of economic globalization to escape entirely from government regulation in the developed countries, Panitch and Gindin add, large multinational corporations (MNCs) today are still relying heavily on government protection to stabilize the global investment and production system as a whole. Admittedly, today's MNC's may rely on many states for protection, not just one. Yet they are far from trying to hollow out the state or destroy its power entirely, for such power remains central to the corporations' profitability, if not their survival.","order":0},{"title":"DC Proposal to \"Ban the Box\" for Ex-Inmates Deserves Another Look","date":"2013-01-07","issue":"January 2013","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Just before Christmas, the DC Council put a lump of coal in the stockings of ex-convicts trying to get their lives in order. The Council rejected a bill introduced by Councilmember Marion Barry that would bar employers from asking job seekers about past criminal convictions during the application process. The proposal had gathered more media attention for Barry's parliamentary maneuvers to get the bill before the Council, and for Council Chair Phil Mendelson's equally determined opposition, than for the merits of the issue.\n\nBut first, some background. Approximately 65 million Americans have had some sort of brush with the law that has left them with a criminal record. [*A disproportionate percentage is made up of persons of color*](http://www.prisonpolicy.org/graphs/raceinc.html) – about 62 percent of incarcerated persons are African American and 27 percent are Latino – with arrests heavily weighted to men in their late teens or early twenties. Many of them are the products of poor neighborhoods and troubled families where disincentives to antisocial behavior are weak or missing, and where the full weight of the criminal justice system tends to fall on even minor transgressions. [*If current trends continue*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-missed-opportunity-to-help-ex-offenders/2012/12/21/5395270c-4af6-11e2-9a42-d1ce6d0ed278_story.html), three out of four young African American men in DC are likely to be incarcerated at some time. For these young men, even a minor crime can come with a life sentence of near-unemployability, since most job applications ask whether the applicant has ever been convicted of a crime. Those who check the \"yes\" box often find their resume landing in the trash.\n\nEspecially in the United States – which [*incarcerates more than seven million people, more than any other country*](http://www.naturalnews.com/021290_prison_system_incarceration.html) both in absolute numbers (even more than China) and as a percentage of the population — ensuring that former prisoners can obtain gainful employment after release is a critical part of rehabilitation. To be sure, the U.S. criminal justice system pays little more than lip service to rehabilitation while focusing on removing prisoners from society and meting out punishment. But the specter of thousands of ex-convicts being dumped on the streets each year, many of them driven back to crime by lack of meaningful employment opportunities, should give everyone pause – especially given the fact that [*of all persons arrested for alleged crimes, half of them have prior convictions.*](http://www.convictcriminology.org/pdf/roots.pdf)\n\nWith this in mind, starting in the late 1990s, advocates for ex-prisoners began advocating restrictions on employers' ability to ask about the past criminal convictions of job seekers. Under \"ban-the-box\" proposals, employers would be allowed to ask about criminal records only after an interview – and deny employment only if the conviction indicated the applicant would be unsuitable for the specific job. For instance, an embezzler could be denied a job handling money, and a child molester could be kept out of a daycare center. But no one could be routinely denied employment for, say, a teenage drug-possession rap.\n\nThe first statewide ban-the-box law was passed in [*Hawaii*](http://www.nelp.org/page/-/SCLP/ModelStateHiringInitiatives.pdf?nocdn=1) in 1998, banning both public and private employers from asking about an applicant's criminal record until after being offered employment. The idea spread, if not exactly like wildfire; since then seven other states have adopted similar measures – although only one state, Massachusetts, goes as far as Hawaii in banning discrimination by both public and private employers; the laws of the other states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, Rhode Island and New Mexico) apply only to hiring by state agencies. In addition, [*over 40 cities around the country*](http://www.nelp.org/page/-/SCLP/2011/CityandCountyHiringInitiatives.pdf?nocdn=1), including Baltimore, have passed their own municipal versions of the law. Most \"ban the box\" for only city hiring or for vendors who do business with the city, but a few – including Philadelphia and Newark, N.J. – also cover private employers in their bans.\n\nThe District of Columbia is the only Washington-region government to pass a ban-the-box law. Its 2010 measure applied only to hiring by the DC government. Under Barry's proposal, the ban would have been extended to private employers as well.\n\nCynics have said Barry's sympathy for ex-convicts stem from his own celebrated run-ins with the law. But more likely, he draws his inspiration from his long career as an elected official serving mostly minority constituents, many of them suffering under employment discrimination due to their criminal records – including Barry's current constituents in Ward 8, with its high concentration of poverty and overwhelmingly African American population. His activism, prior to being in elected office, in SNCC and the Free DC movement, also undoubtedly inform his understanding of discrimination against ex-convicts as a civil rights issue.\n\nIt is understandable that many employers might believe it is in their interest to avoid hiring ex-convicts. But it also is in the interest of society at large to reintegrate ex-convicts into society, and to stop adding to the large underclass of former prisoners with minimal prospects of earning an honest living.\n\nStudies are lacking on the impact of ban-the-box laws on recidivism. However, when one looks at [*crime trends in Hawaii*](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/hicrime.htm), the state with the longest experience with these laws, it's notable that overall crime rates and the rate of property crime have declined dramatically – by 32.0 and 34.4 percent, respectively – since the law was passed in 1998, compared to [*nationwide*](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm) declines of 28.6 percent in overall crime and a 28.2 percent in property crimes. Crimes against property – burglary, larceny and vehicle theft – are what one might expect less of if ex-convicts are able to find work in the legal economy. (Interestingly, Hawaii's rate of violent crime has risen over that period, while that of the United States as a whole has dropped).\n\nOf course, helping ex-convicts find legal employment should be only part of the reform of the prison-industrial complex. Other problems abound: the lack of meaningful training and rehabilitation opportunities in prison, the trend toward prison privatization (which provides a financial incentive for prison-owning corporations to lobby for more incarceration and harsher sentences) and the tendency of government to view low-income communities of color as largely law-enforcement problems rather than people in need of jobs, education, health care, better housing and other services that affluent Americans take for granted. Nevertheless, ban-the-box statutes could provide a first step toward breaking the stranglehold of past mistakes on millions of Americans' future life prospects. The Council should take a fresh look at a comprehensive ban-the-box bill in the new year.","order":1},{"title":"DC-area action on GMO foods, labeling on tap","date":"2013-01-07","issue":"January 2013","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"If you eat food products containing corn, soybeans or canola grown in the United States, there is a good chance you're consuming food affected in some way by commercial genetic engineering. If you wear clothing made from American-grown cotton, you also have more than a 50% chance of being a consumer of fibers from plants whose DNA has been artificially modified. What's more, there's a good chance the genetically modified food and fiber you're consuming is not clearly labeled, so that you may be purchasing it without knowing.\n\nOut of growing concern over this situation – and in many cases, out of outrage – a growing number of environmentally-minded activists are employing political, legal, and direct action strategies to put pressure on Monsanto, a leading promoter of genetically engineered crop plants in the US and the world and a bullying presence in the electoral arena and the courts to enforce its control of its major patents and products.\n\nFor democratic socialists in the metro Washington DC area who want to join the fight against Monsanto and genetically modified food, several opportunities for activism invite your participation over the new few months.\n\nBut would-be activists should be warned: the scientific and legal issues at stake are complex, and some factual issues in question are bitterly disputed. To paraphrase the title of a famous John Steinbeck novel about a Communist-led farm workers strike in the 1930s, it may be that in some cases, the activists and company are engaged \"In Dubious Battle,\" a battle that may not appeal to the finicky.\n\nAmong the organizations leading the anti-Monsanto, anti-genetic engineering fight are the Organic Consumers Association or OCA, and the direct action group \"Occupy Monsanto.\" Both groups were represented at a January 3 meeting, held at the Friends Meeting House in Washington, on Monsanto and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food.\n\nA key strategy of OCA in the anti-GMO fight, according to OCA's director Ronnie Cummins, involves state-level ballot initiatives on \"right to know\" legislation, to ensure that consumers can tell from clear labeling whether GMO ingredients are present in food. In last November's election, some 6 milllon California voters – nearly 40 % of those who went to the polls – voted for Proposition 37, a ballot initiative that would have required GMO labeling.\n\nOpinion polls taken before the ballot indicated that a large majority of Californians, from both major parties, want to have the right to know whether they're purchasing GMO-modified food, Cummins said.\n\nBut Monsanto and other corporate interests involved in genetic engineering and agribusiness waged a $45 million scare campaign against the labeling measure, and although ballot proponents got financial support from several organic food related businesses and were able to mount a modest media effort to counter the corporate barrage, the ballot question lost by a narrow margin in November. Many \"no\" voters indicated that they ended up opposing the measure because they feared it might hurt small family farmers, or that it would cause large increases in food prices, or that it would subject California agriculture to an unwieldy state regulatory bureaucracy.\n\nOCA and its allies are studying the reasons why people who want more information about GMOs in food nevertheless rejected the ballot measure, Cummins said. But activists are not considering the California vote a real defeat. Instead, organizing efforts are underway to pass ballot initiatives on GMO labeling in more than a dozen other states, with the state of Washington being a special focus for the near future.\n\nMany activists in the GMO labeling campaign are opposed to all use of genetic engineering in foods, Cummins acknowledged at the Friends Meeting event, but the focus of the campaigns is on \"honesty,\" on the public's right to know.\n\nIn addition, Cummins said, the anti-GMO and pro-labeling activists are reaching out to activists in other movements, notably the ones against the overuse of pesticides and the abuse of farm animals in agribusiness feedlots, as well as environmentalists working to battle global climate change.\n\nMost genetically modified grain crops are fed to animals, not directly to human beings, Cummins said, and there is a clear connection between Monsanto's promotion of GMO crops, excessive use of agricultural chemicals, and the fattening of animals in overcrowded feedlots where large doses of antibiotics are needed to prevent outbreaks of disease.\n\nAnimal-based agriculture also is a major source of \"greenhouse\" gases, both because of the methane generated by animal feedlots and because of the fossil fuels used in farm equipment, in transporting meat to market, and in agriculture chemicals used to grow feed grains. By forging closer ties among animal welfare groups, anti-pesticide activists, climate change activists and the anti-GMO movement, it may be possible to organize a much stronger movement for fundamental change.\n\nTwo recently organized activist campaigns in the metro DC area are poised to join the fight, according to Alexis Bader-Mayer, the political director for OCA, who organized the Jan. 3 meeting at the Friends Meeting House. A new organization in the District called \"GMO Free DC\" and a sister organization, formed only last month, called \"GMO Free Maryland\" both are organizing to for local labeling laws to inform consumers about GMO foods.\n\nAddressing the issue of GMO foods from another angle is Adam Eininger of \"Occupy Monsanto,\" a loose coalition of activist groups in many different states and several foreign countries who are using nonviolent civil disobedience and other forms of direct action to spread awareness about Monsanto and GMOs.\n\nOne focus of Occupy Monsanto activism in this coming week will be a demonstration outside the courthouse of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit at 171 Madison Place, N.W., in Washington, as the court prepares to hear an appeal in the case OSGATA v. Monsanto.\n\nIn this case, the Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association (OSGATA) originally sued to prevent Monsanto from engaging in the practice of bringing \"intellectual property\" suits against non-purchasers of the company's genetically engineered \"Roundup Ready\" crops – including corn, soybeans and canola – who find their own organically raised crops cross-pollinated by pollen from nearby fields using Monsanto's products.\n\nIn the past, Monsanto has filed some 144 lawsuits (and settled around 700) involving non-purchasers of Monsanto seeds genetically engineered to be resistant to the company's popular \"Roundup\" herbicide. The company has won several lawsuits it which it claimed that farmers whose fields have been pollinated by pollen drift from \"Roundup Ready\" crops had violated Monsanto's patents, by raising Roundup-ready plants without paying Monsanto for the privilege.\n\nMonsanto in its defense has claimed that the farmers in question were not raising Roundup-ready crops by accident, but were deliberately making use of pollen drift and accidental pollination to take advantage of Monsanto's technology without paying for it. In its defense against the OSGATA lawsuit, it argued that it had no intention of bringing suit in the future against organic farmers who did not welcome cross-fertilization from Roundup-ready fields.\n\nIn February 2012, the federal district court for the Southern District of New York sided with Monsanto in the case, ruling that the organic seed farmers' allegations against Monsanto were \"unsubstantiated\" and that the plaintiffs had no evidence that Monsanto had threatened them with legal action due to their crops being pollinated with Roundup-Ready genes through \"inadvertent means.\"\n\nIn its appeal of the lower court ruling, however, OSGATA and a number of public interest groups filing amicus or \"friend of the court\" briefs are arguing (among other things) that Monsanto's patents and its practice of taking aggressive legal action to prevent the unauthorized use of its patented GMO crops have created a situation of fear and uncertainty for organic famers.\n\nAccording to the plaintiffs, this has subjected organic seed growers to unwanted expenses in the form of spending large sums to plant buffer crops between their crops and neighboring fields, so as to prevent cross-pollination, and spending extra money to clean their equipment to make sure it is not contaminated with patented Monsanto GMOs.\n\nAs the court of appeals prepares to hear the appeal on Jan. 10, Occupy Monsanto plans to join organic farmers from around the country in a demonstration outside the courtroom, and Eininger is inviting other concerned activists to attend.\n\nOccupy Monsanto also will hold a small, basically friendly demonstration at President Obama's second inauguration celebration on January 21, Eininger said.\n\nThe demonstration is not designed to be overly critical of Obama, given the overall celebratory atmosphere of the second inaugural event, Eininger said. But demonstrators will seek to inform the President's supporters of Obama's promise on the campaign trail in 2007 to exercise adequate oversight over large agribusiness – a promise seemingly belied by the Obama administration's later appointment of Michael Taylor, a former vice president for Monsanto, to become Deputy Commissioner for Foods at the FDA.\n\n*Washington Socialist* readers who are interested in learning more about the anti-Monsanto and anti-GMO fights may access more information about these issues at the web sites [*http://occupy-monsanto.com/*](http://occupy-monsanto.com/), for Occupy Monsanto, [*http://www.gmofreedc.org/*](http://www.gmofreedc.org/). for GMO Free DC, [*https://www.facebook.com/GMOfreeMD*](https://www.facebook.com/GMOfreeMD), for the recently formed GMO Free Maryland, and [*http://www.organicconsumers.org/*](http://www.organicconsumers.org/), for the Organic Consumers Association.\n\n[*Democracy in the workplace*](http://dsadc.org/democracy-in-the-workplace/)\n\nMonday, January 7th, 2013\n\n***The Washington Socialist*** &lt;&gt; **January 2013**\n*By Luke Abel and Coleman McFarland*\n\n*Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism* (Haymarket Books) is Richard Wolff's passionate argument for Workers' Self-Directed Enterprises as a social project, a way forward for egalitarians to change the organization of production in a globalized world.\n\nThe book – less than 200 pages – feels like a pamphlet, and is divided into three parts. Part I is a historical treatment of the various crises of modern capitalism from a Marxist perspective. We get a somewhat dry summary of causes and consequences of the crisis of the 1930s that will be familiar to everyone who's done any political reading at all for the past 10 years. This is the \"boring but necessary\" part, needed to educate readers without much exposure to post-capitalist politics and thought. Wolff tries to show that crisis is built into the economic system itself, and that an alternative way of doing things is necessary.\n\nPart II deals with the kinds of alternatives we have already tried, from social democracy to Stalinism. The \"actually existing socialisms,\" Wolff claims, were (and are) actually state capitalisms. This rhetorical move, familiar to the left, might frustrate the general reader. However, it speaks to the central point of the book. The revolutionaries of 20th Century socialism only removed capitalism from the economy's commanding heights, but kept it in the workplace. And it's there, Wolff argues, where democracy matters most.\n\nThe final third leads us to Wolff's proposed solution, the (awkwardly named?) Workers' Self-Directed Enterprises (WSDEs). WSDEs are reorganized cooperatives where the workers not only collectively own and/or manage the business, but direct it as well. This entails appropriating and distributing the surplus – paying workers, paying taxes, choosing community endeavors to support (like education), and determining reinvestment. In a WSDE this is handled democratically, with elections of actual workers to a larger board of directors.\n\nOther than that, the WSDE is like any other autonomous firm in the market: buying inputs, selling outputs, and generating environmental externalities. Wolff explicitly states that WSDEs have good incentives in the market and society, where capitalist firms – whose owners may live thousands of miles away from the river they're polluting – do not. For instance, when faced with a decision of how to deal with industrial waste, we can imagine a firm directed by its workers to decide to purchase technology that minimizes pollution rather than paying out more profits in dividends. This is because the workers live near the site of production and raise their families there as well. He speaks again to the general reader steeped in market ideology: We should want good behavior from our firms. The question is what kind of organization achieves that?\n\nThe descriptions of the inner workings of the WSDE are where the book really shines. Every worker would have two jobs with a particular task within the division of labor, and also the job of directing the firm by deciding what to produce and where, and what to do with the surplus. Day-to-day management could take many forms – and Wolff glosses over this a bit. Perhaps the firm's board will maintain a traditional management structure, or maybe workers would decide to use other approaches to coordinate decisions, such as rotating management positions or using consensus-based decision making. It's up to them.\n\nIf the aim of the WSDE as an organizational form is to democratize the directorial decisions of firms, Democracy at Work would benefit from a more serious treatment of how to democratize roles in the division of labor that have been historically assigned along gender lines, or how a movement for WSDEs would incorporate struggles against racism and sexism. These topics were conspicuously lacking, and they deserve a higher profile in further commentaries on workplace democracy.\n\nLike any good pamphlet, Democracy at Work ends with assessing what is to be done in our current political context. Wolff favors lobbying the state for a federal jobs program that could, in the vein of Italy's 1985 Marcora Law, provide startup capital to workers committed to building a WSDE. This is an alternative to vague provisions to support \"small businesses\" – a regulatory distinction much abused. Proponents of WSDEs should also seek alliances with existing worker cooperatives as well as trade unions. Wolff also argues for founding a broad-based political party that supports WSDEs in its platform.\n\nShould there be any doubt, Wolff explicitly locates a movement for WSDEs in the socialist tradition, but he is far more interested in engaging mainstream liberals and conservatives on some fresh terrain, away from the old fields of right vs. left politics and closer to contemporary politico-economic language. An exciting aspect of WSDEs is that economic democracy – within firms themselves – is something that anyone can argue for in our current political climate without committing himself or herself to the margins of debate. Workplace democracy – having workers set production targets and decide what to do with profits – is something that the average person can discuss at lunch with their coworkers.\n\nSee http://democracyatwork.info for more on Wolff's project.\n\n[*New Year's 'Revolutions' for Socialists*](http://dsadc.org/new-years-revolutions-for-socialists/)\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;* January 2013**\n\n*By Bill Mosley*\n\nMany of us enter a new year with a commitment to turn over a new leaf, to usher in a new and improved \"us\" to accompany the change in the calendar. For many, New Year's resolutions may include losing weight, spending more time with the family, spending more time at work, spending *less* time at work, etc.\n\nBut as socialists, shouldn't the changes we envision in ourselves revolve around the goal of creating a more just and egalitarian society? We can't exactly \"resolve\" social change –saying \"I resolve to bring about a single-payer health care system\" doesn't make it so. Real social changes requires being part of an organization or movement of like-minded individuals over a lifetime of struggle.\n\nNevertheless, there are numerous changes in our individual behaviors and practices that can help move the struggle forward, if only a little, by injecting a little socialism at the grass roots. After all, virtually every important social change started with an individual taking action.\n\nSo following is my (very incomplete) list of \"revolutions\" individual DSA members can take to make 2013 a more \"socialist\" year than any other in U.S. history (at least since 1912):\n\n1) **Come out of the socialist closet** – Do you identify yourself as a socialist outside of DSA meetings or other progressive gatherings? If not, try displaying the \"rose and hands\" at unusual venues. Wear your DSA button at the supermarket; show up at a family reunion in a DSA T-shirt. Drop quotations from Michael Harrington or Joe Schwartz where least expected. Think about showing the colors at work, especially if you work in a lefty/progressive organization, and even if you don't.\n\n2) **Patronize small, local businesses** – Seek out the true Mom and Pop businesses in your neighborhood and shun the giant corporations whenever possible. Buy your produce at farmer's markets instead of Safeway. Seek out your local co-ops.\n\n3) Especially – in a corollary to 2 – **don't EVER shop at Wal-Mart** – The world's most hegemonic corporation hasn't broken ground in DC – yet – but it's ensconced in the suburbs and online. I don't need to go into detail here about its abuse of its workers, its destruction of local businesses, its contribution to sprawl, its shameless exploitation of near-slave labor abroad. Think what would happen if everyone adopted this.\n\n4) **Create more, consume less** – As David Byrne writes in *How Music Works*, \"\\[T\\]hose in power don't want us to enjoy making things for ourselves – they'd prefer to establish a cultural hierarchy that devalues our amateur efforts and encourages consumption rather than creation ... Capitalism tends toward the creation of passive consumers.\" Instead of buying a CD or downloading an MP3, why not spend an hour playing an instrument (or learning one if you don't know how?) Reading a book or article is fine; but why not occasionally write something instead (like an article for the *Washington Socialist*)? Instead of watching football, go out and toss a ball with a friend. Instead of watching a commercial movie, put on a puppet show (especially if you have kids, but even if you don't)!\n\n5) **Subvert advertising** – Just because a product is being pushed online, on TV or in print doesn't mean it's any good, but only that someone wants to make a profit by selling it to you. I've adopted this \"revolution\" for several years running: I make a note of the products advertisers are most aggressively pushing at me and will make a point of NOT buying any of those things. (I may not be the only one: I recently bought \"No-Ad\" sunblock whose very name touts its refusal to advertise – and implies that at least some shoppers are attracted to the idea).\n\n6) **Be a \"Pistachio Socialist\"** – Mix some green with your red! Any just, egalitarian future must include protection of the environment as a central cause. We can't save the Brazilian rainforest in a day, but there are lots of things we can do: If you drive, do so as little as possible; walk, cycle and use transit; recycle and use recycled materials; turn off the lights when you leave a room; plant a tree.\n\nNone of this substitutes for the basics: being active in political work, paying dues, and making financial contributions to the extent you can. But being a socialist should be more than checking the right boxes – it should be a way of life. Try working more of the \"S-word\" into your daily life in 2013.\n\nBe Sociable, Share!","order":2},{"title":"Prospects for Reducing Mass Killings","date":"2013-01-07","issue":"January 2013","author":"Bill Boteler","body":"\"We need to make access to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun\" said President Obama in a recent speech addressing the need for policies to prevent future recurrence of mass killing tragedies such as the one in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14th.\n\nThis would be a worthy policy goal but can it happen in a political system like the contemporary United States? I decided to explore recent efforts to address these issues and how special interest groups have supported or opposed them.\n\nOne reason for inadequate access to mental health care is discrimination by the insurance industry, which has been unwilling to pay for mental health treatments on a par with other health treatments.\n\nTo address this, the mental health parity act, HR1424, was designed to require insurance companies to require coverage of mental health care as they cover so-called physical illnesses. But according to MapLight.org, a nonprofit organization that tracks campaign contributions and relates them to politicians' votes, opponents of health care parity gave five times as much in contributions as did proponents over a two-year period.\n\nGroups such as AFLAC, Inc., the National Restaurant Association, America's Health Insurance Plans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbied heavily against passage of mental health parity in the US House of Representatives and, though they did not prevail, were able to outspend the bill's proponents, which included groups such as the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nClearly, there are many groups trying to influence these sorts of policies. These groups are motivated by financial gain as well as other values. The National Rifle Association is supposed to represent the interests of private gun owners and their constitutional rights. According to Sourcewatch, a nonprofit watchdog group, NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre made over $900,000 a year, circa 2007. This is not to say that he doesn't believe deeply in the Second Amendment. But according to the Better Business Bureau, in 2004 the NRA spent 46% of its contributions on fundraising.\n\nThe NRA has called for putting more guns in schools and creating a bigger list of people treated for mental illness, which would be quite a large one since it is estimated that 1 in 4 Americans are treated for a mental illness each year.\n\nThe Gun Industry has its own lobby group, the National Shooting Sports Foundation located, ironically, in Newtown, Connecticut. The NSSF spent over $500,000 on lobbying in 2012. The NSSF has been promoting military-style assault weapons to increase sales in a saturated gun market. It has lobbied to keep assault weapons on the market.\n\nOne law that was intended to control the mass gun violence was the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004. There has been some question about whether or not the ban was successful in halting mass shootings since such events are too few to be statistically analyzed. Nevertheless, the number of mass shootings has doubled since the ban expired.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) stated she will be introducing new legislation after the beginning of the year to regulate assault weapons. Her bill will ban the sale, transfer, importation and possession of assault weapons. It will not affect assault weapons that people already own. It will also affect big clips, drums or strips of more than 10 bullets.\n\nClearly, there is a lot of momentum now for some kind of action on these issues. Other cultural factors such as the effects of violent media are not part of this article but similar interests will come into play with any attempt at regulation. The question is whether strong public support can lead to the persistent pressure needed to overcome the power of well-heeled interest groups with professional lobbyists.

A lot of the ideological work that goes on in our everyday lives (often to our grief, as socialists) takes place in the sentences we utter and the sentences we allow to get uttered without challenge. In other words – a familiar term – ideology lives in \"the discourse.\"\n\nLuntz knew this in 1994 when he helped Gingrich author the well-known/infamous \"GOPAC memo.\" Based on focus-group cullings, \"Language: A Key Mechanism of Control\" contained what Wikipedia calls a list of \"contrasting words\" and \"optimistic positive governing words\" for use in describing political factions, self and \"other.\"\n\nThis seminal path to power in the era of Newt's original incarnation\\[Cc1\\] has much to do with the contested terrain of today's political discourse, and we socialists and progressives recognize the specific areas where we have to fight uphill battles past terms like \"entitlements\" and \"fiscal cliff\" – let alone \"Kenyan socialist.\"\n\nSo, a good resolution for socialists in 2013: Take control of the language in public discourse, or (realistically) more control than we have now.\n\nLuntz and Gingrich were thorough, intuiting the emotional language of metaphor that we see echoed in the work (on our side of the political fence) by George Lakoff, of whom more below.\n\nThe GOPAC memo shows that opponents can be labeled or emotionally associated with words like decay, fail(ure) collapse, destructive, sick, pathetic, traitor. These qualities can be applied to liberals, union \"bureaucracy\" and, of course, \"they\" or \"those people.\"\n\nWords and emotions to associated with \"our side\" include share, change, opportunity, legacy, challenge, control, truth, moral, courage, reform, prosperity, movement, children, family, competitive, candid, humane, provide. These qualities apply to \"we\" and \"us.\" After the triumphalist linguistic mishaps of the Iraq war, the 1994 good-guy term \"crusade\" may, however, have discreetly vanished from the current right-wing glossary. But it may be back someday. Luntz is still in business with many clients on the right, including the religious right.\n\nSocialists and progressives need to recognize the truth in some of what Luntz says, and recognize, too, that his glossary of positive terms spills over with language (\"change,\" \"reform,\" \"prosperity\") we already use in our progressive discourse. The argument here is not that we have to reverse course, but that we should be more conscious of:\n\n&gt;&gt;the values expressed in the words and combinations we use and\n\n&gt;&gt;the additional value of using terms like this consensually, systematically and as a matter of organizational practice. We need to sharpen our vocabulary and consciously use it in our organizational statements and in concert with other progressives.\n\nThe immediate reaction – maybe yours, the reader's – will be to freeze up at the thought of \"political correctness\" in language, of the – yes, Orwellian – label often applied to regulated language within an organization. And it is a concern.\n\nStill, we need to be opportunistic. Our glossary of positive language should not be exclusive and reductionist, but inclusive and accumulative. When contesting a pernicious meme like \"fiscal cliff,\" we should gleefully jump on a great piggyback meme-reverser like \"fiscal bluff,\" which NPC member Theresa Alt tossed into the mix on the DSA Activist listserv recently.\n\nGeorge Lakoff, surely our ally in most things and a regular linguistic analyst of the metaphoric meme traffic in political discourse, points out that \"fiscal cliff,\" for instance, partakes of a cognitively rooted linkage that says up is good, down is bad. Lakoff (a HuffPost regular) has much to offer us when we test-drive our potential organizational memes.\n\nWe (in our local DC-DSA) are already engaged in this kind of work. Our \"GETUP\" training sessions are designed to provide alternative terminology and narratives for the conventional-wisdom pseudoeconomic labels that mask ruling-class control of resources, workers and the reins of government. Terms like \"job creators\" and \"mismatch of jobs and skills\" need to be vigorously countered.\n\nAs socialists and progressives we need to be conscious of the power of our words, phrases and narrative schemas, and whenever possible float and refloat the successful ones. We as socialists need to develop specific, easily graspable narratives that power our vision of democratic public control and management of resources and provision, of putting market power to the service of people rather than making people servants of the market.\n\nAnd, when we as an organization see this language is successful in pulling off the mask, we need to put that language out there much more competitively than we are now – make DSA statements and issue DSA working papers that get some resonance in the main channels of information.\n\nResolved?\n\n[*The passing of Gerda Lerner, 92*](http://dsadc.org/the-passing-of-gerda-lerner-92/)\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;* January 2013**\n\n*By Carolyn Byerly*\n\nGerda Lerner, a pioneering feminist scholar, lived a long and unusually grounded life for one who was radical in spirit and deed. A refugee from Nazi-occupied Europe and later one of several co-founders of NOW, the National Organization for Women, she grounded her feminist analysis in her own experiences as a wife and mother but also addressed women's roles from a class perspectiveover the course of her career. She died Jan. 2 at age 92.\n\nAs a major influence in my own consciousness-raising,Lerneroffered an important starting point for thoseof us grasping for real information about women's place in society. She made her mark as a feminist scholar for her leadership in women's studies, having founded the first university program in women's history at Sarah Lawrence College in 1972. What drove her, she said, was the absence of women's presence in historical accounts. She told the *New York Times* in 2002 that whatever contribution she might make to women's history and studies \"came out of my practical life experience.\"\n\nLerner's work was anchored in her own daily life and its varied experiences, including six weeks spent in an Austrian prison in the late 1930s. She later said that everything she needed to survive the rest of her life was learned from those women she lived in close quarters with during those difficult weeks. In the course of her life, she experienced anti-Semitism, misogyny, and McCarthyism.\n\nGerda Hedwig Kronstein was born April 20, 1920, into a prosperous Jewish family in Vienna, according to the *Washington Post* (Jan. 5, 2012, p. B4). She came to the United States in 1939 with a fiancé who would become her first husband in a short-lived marriage. It was her second husband, Carl Lerner, who became her intellectual partner for life. They collaborated on a 1951 musical, \"Singing of Women,\" published a novel on the rise of fascism in Austria, and co-wrote the screenplay for \"Black Like Me,\" a story about a white man who disguises himself as black in the South.\n\nGerda Lerner spent most of her academic life at University of Wisconsin, Madison. She leaves behind a significant body of work that included numerous books, including *Black Women in White America* (1972), *The Creation of Patriarchy* (1986) and *The Creation of Feminist Consciousness* (1997), and *Fireweed: A Political Biography* (2003), among others. In leading the establishment of women's history as a recognized field of study, she was never narrow in her own research pursuits. She was, for instance, concerned about white women's role in the abolitionist movement, about black women's place in history, and about housewives and mothers.\n\nVarious obituaries have cited Lerner's autobiographical writings in which she explored her own central identity as \"a typical American housewife who stayed home to raise my children.\" Lerner didn't begin her college education until age 38, when her children were older. She completed a bachelor's at the New School and master's and doctoral degrees at Columbia. Toward the end of her graduate studies, she joined with feminist labor activist Betty Friedan and others to found National Organization for Women.\n\nOne of Lerner's well-guarded secrets until she began to publish her autobiographical works, e.g., *Fireweed*, was her membership in the Communist Party. Her husband Carl was a member when she married him in 1949 and she later also joined. Her memoirs state that what was important to her was what she believed to be \"a strong international movement for progress and social justice.\" No lover of the Soviet Union, she was nevertheless interested in the \"vibrant experiment\" that was going on within that country. As witness to history, she predicted the capitalist nations would unite against the Soviet Union, as they had done against Russia after the Bolshevik revolution ([*http://jwa.org/media/gerda-lerner-writes-about-communist-party-and-hollywood-10*](http://jwa.org/media/gerda-lerner-writes-about-communist-party-and-hollywood-10)).\n\nLerner's Marxist feminist analysis can be seen in her understanding of class relations, but most markedly in concerns about women's role in domestic production and reproduction (aspects of women's experience which she believed feminist scholars neglected). In her efforts to theorize patriarchal social systems, she factored in women's birthing and caretaking roles, which she believed had served to differentiate gender roles in ways that gave men more power. She inspired other socialist feminist scholars globally to advocate for women's unpaid domestic work. Lerner and others who agreed with her have argued women's domestic labor should be figured into nations' GNPs, and women who stay at home should be compensated through social security.\n\nLerner was a private person who gave few interviews. A few years ago, a media activist filmmaker I know, Janet Fitch, managed to make contact with Lerner who agreed to give her a 15-minute interview for her film on gun violence. Gerder Lerner remained engaged in social justice to the end of her life.","order":4},{"title":"2015 Young Democratic Socialists Winter Conference: Toward an Intersectional Left: A Reportback","date":"2015-03-01","issue":"March 2015","author":"Bryan Kovalick","body":"Over Valentine's Day Weekend I, along with four other members of the Metro DC DSA, rode a bus bound for New York City. We headed to this year's Young Democratic Socialist Winter Conference. And though we arrived far too late on Friday night to attend the conference's opening plenary on police violence, our trip north was not without its own discussions on politics, labor, and socialist news.\n\nThe Saturday morning plenary included two speeches on the importance of being a socialist and roles that socialists can have in shaping a more just, free, and egalitarian society. Speaking immediately after DSA Vice-Chair Joe Schwartz was our comrade Jose Gutierrez. Together, Jose and Joe began the day of the conference on a high note speaking of the necessity of raising the minimum wage into a living wage, the need for fully-funded public services and goods, and the need to organize working class [*\\[DD1\\]*](http://dsadc.org/2015/03/page/2/#_msocom_1)power to build a mass movement for socialism in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.\n\nFollowing their morning talk, I attended a workshop on the 7 habits of highly effective chapters. To my actual dismay, there were not 7 habits that Philly DSA member Dustin Guastella could impart to me. But Dustin had plenty of useful tips for improving the growing and improving of one's chapter. This workshop gave me a moment to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of our own chapter. [*\\[DD2\\]*](http://dsadc.org/2015/03/page/2/#_msocom_2)\n\nWhen I assess our chapter I see that we do organize great salons and talks on interesting and very topical matters. However we do not do the best job advertising our events and ourselves as socialists to the interested public. And although we do have several ways for prospective members to become involved with our chapter, we do not do the best job at retaining their long-term interest and commitment. Furthermore we also seem to fail at times to develop prospective socialists into fully-fledged socialists. But I think both of these issues would be improved by committing more of our chapter to the Fight for $15 campaign. I think there's a lot of truth to the saying that we grow as socialists by doing socialist work. And committing ourselves to this work would not only help build working class power by reducing the power of the 1%, but it will also help us to grow as a chapter and as seasoned socialist organizers.\n\nAfter Dustin's workshop concluded, I attended another one given by Boston DSA member Jared Abbott that delved more deeply into meaning of socialism. Jared's presentation asked us to define socialism in our terms, before he then challenged our notions by posing a series of thought-provoking hypothetical questions to us. This presentation gave us some much needed time to unpack our conceptions of socialism by asking us to critically ponder our own understanding of the term. From this I gained a little more insight into my own assumptions, and learned a little more about how I could defend my belief in socialism from valuable criticism. For that reason, I really enjoyed Jared's presentation.\n\nSaturday concluded with a reportback section where each individual chapter and regional organizer had the opportunity before the entire conference to present their members, talk about their campaigns and issues they're working to address, and a little about the struggles and success they've had as a chapter . Some of the newer chapters like the students from Case Western University talked about the struggles they're having as they move from an organizing committee to an established chapter, particularly with membership recruitment and choosing a campaign focus. Likewise some older and more established chapters like Sewanee University discussed their continuing success in developing their chapter and their work in solidarity with the local Nashville, Tenn. Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThough I was happy to see so many older chapters in attendance, I was especially thrilled to learn that New York City colleges were so well represented at the conference. Just within the last year or so, many young socialists, who were almost all of working class backgrounds from around NYC, helped organize and start four new campus chapters at different city colleges. All of these are in addition to the New York DSA local, which has been revitalized with several new members.\n\nAfter the reportback period, we left the conference's CUNY grounds and made our way to Brooklyn for our socialist party that night. The party gave us a nice way to socialize together in a very stress-less and unstructured setting, which the very scheduled nature of the conference often doesn't allow.\n\nSunday's opening plenary was given by a representative of the A. Philip Randolph Caucus and one from the Left Caucus. The representative of the former was our chapter's own David Duhalde, while the latter was NYC DSA member Neal Meyer. David and Neal presented their vision of DSA's electoral strategy and the goals DSA should position itself to achieve in the near and immediate term. Both speakers felt the old DSA electoral strategy of realignment was dead. Duhalde and Meyer differed over what that should mean for DSA and YDS. Duhalde embraced deprioritizing electoral politics, while Meyer embraced supporting explicitly socialist candidates. One longtime YDS member I spoke with described the plenary as one of the best he's ever seen.\n\nTo echo their sentiment, I will add that altogether the conference was one of the best that I have ever attended. It was not only well attended in terms of numbers, but also in that so many of the attendees were passionate, committed, and dedicated socialists. I was even pleased at the demographic makeup of the conference attendees. Truth be told the conference did not achieve gender and sexual equality of representation. But it did come closer to that goal than any other conference I've attended. I was also astounded at the presence of so many nonwhite attendees. Again, racial and ethnic representation at the conference was not proportionately equal to society at large. But it was yet again closer to achieving that goal than any other YDS conference I've been to.\n\nFor these reasons, the issues and topics discussed, and the feeling of optimism amongst us, I'm very glad that I chose to attend. And I am very glad that for all the attendees who came to their first YDS conference, they had this moment to help mold their socialist identities.\n\n***David Duhalde contributed to this article***","order":0},{"title":"Activism Pushed FCC Ruling on Net Neutrality","date":"2015-03-01","issue":"March 2015","author":"Carolyn M. Byerly","body":"The historic adoption of a policy of Net Neutrality by the Federal Communications Commission passed by a 3-2 vote (along party lines) on February 26, and activists across American can take a bow for a victory that is theirs to claim.\n\nThe policy is the product of several years' careful strategizing, letter writing, picketing (outside FCC offices), and other hallmarks of progressive activism by an eclectic coalition across the country. The call for Internet Neutrality has been actively championed by public interest groups for several years, but this hot potato issue pitting citizens (and their advocacy groups) against the giant corporations controlling Internet and other media services heated up after a January 2014 federal court ruling ([**Verizon v. the FCC**](http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3AF8B4D938CDEEA685257C6000532062/$file/11-1355-1474943.pdf)) that told the FCC it had overreached its authority in its policy barring broadband providers from slowing or blocking Web traffic.\n\nThe 2010 [*FCC policy that Verizon challenged had *](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-14/verizon-wins-net-neutrality-court-ruling-against-fcc)required Internet providers to treat all customers equally and to disclose their network practices. The US Circuit Court ruling said before the FCC could regulate companies' operations, it would have to decide whether the Internet was a telecommunications industry (under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, regulating common carriers of information), or a content provider. This legal distinction is one that, in the first instance, enables the FCC to regulate the Internet like a utility and prescribe how service shall be provided, but in the second does not. With the new February 26 policy, FCC is now able to prevent the creation of a tiered pricing structure (and the differentials in speed and capacity based on what a client pays that would come with it) as lobbied for by the telecom giants.\n\nPlans to roll out a strikingly progressive policy were first announced by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler in January, and the details were revealed in a February 19 posting to the [*FCC website*](http://www.fcc.gov/document/statement-fcc-chairman-tom-wheeler-fccs-open-internet-rules). But the back story is one that brings the role of [*leftist*](http://centerformediajustice.org/tag/net-neutrality/), [*feminist*](http://www.savetheinternet.com/blog/09/10/29/feminist-majority-foundation-supports-net-neutrality), and [*civil rights*](http://www.freepress.net/blog/2015/02/19/communities-color-speak-out-real-net-neutrality) activism clearly into view – including the positions that our own local [*Metro DC DSA*](http://dsadc.org/dc-local-weighs-in-on-net-neutrality-cable-megamerger/) has taken. After the *Verizon v. FCC* ruling, activist groups coordinated their letter writing and visits to FCC commissioners to [*make a case*](http://dsadc.org/net-neutrality-and-the-ordinary-folks/) for classifying the Internet as a telecommunications industry in order to assure Net Neutrality.\n\nAn unprecedented 4 million-plus letters were filed with the FCC after January 2014, most of those taking the public interest position. By November 2014, [*President Obama*](http://www.commondreams.org/news/2014/11/10/response-unprecedented-public-outcry-obama-goes-big-net-neutrality) called the Internet \"one of the most significant democratizing influences the world has ever known,\" and advocated protecting the Internet from monopoly control. Although an independent agency, FCC is presently under Democratic control with three commissioners, including the chairman. All FCC commissioners are by presidential appointment, with the party in the White House holding the majority.\n\nBut the story does not end with the February 26 policy adoption. Conservative forces in Congress are now plotting to thwart the FCC with [*a strategy*](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/gop-game-plan-on-net-neutrality-115124.html) that includes investigations into alleged White House interference in FCC process, launching public criticism of the FCC, and crafting legislation to reverse the present policy of Net Neutrality. The telecom giants are also threatening lawsuits saying that the FCC has over-reached its authority and essentially put regulation of the Internet into the hands of government. There is logic to their claims in the second of these contentions, but government (remember that representative of citizens?) is the only entity with the power to speak and act for the great majority of US residents who rely on digital communications.\n\nActivists' work is not over if Net Neutrality is to be maintained. Ironically, because the mainstream news (owned by some of those same giant parent companies that control the Internet) covered this David and Goliath contest so avidly, there is a strong likelihood that the number of media activists has swollen these last months.\n\n***The author has been part of the public-interest lobbying for Net Neutrality through her role in*** [****Howard Media Group****](http://www.howardmediagroup.org/)***, an activist academic organization at Howard University***","order":1},{"title":"DC Politics Roundup: Democracy Takes a Back Seat in DC Special Elections","date":"2015-03-01","issue":"March 2015","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"We in Washington DC are often told we live in a democracy, but reality often seems to indicate otherwise. The most obvious democratic shortcoming is the ability of Congress to intervene at will in the District's governance, something it cannot do to, or in, any of the 50 states. But sometimes elements within DC itself conspire to undermine what little democracy we have.\n\nTake the April 28 special elections to fill D.C. Council vacancies in Wards 4 and 8, for example. The ascension of former Ward 4 Councilmember Muriel Bowser to the office of mayor, and the death of Ward 8 Councilmember and former Mayor Marion Barry, could have provided an opening for fresh ideas and a vigorous debate about issues facing the wards and the city. And indeed, there have been no shortage of candidates for the seats, with 14 on the ballot in Ward 4 and 16 in Ward 8. However, in both wards there are attempts to turn both elections into coronations and to short-circuit any debate on the issues.[*\\[Cc1\\]*](http://dsadc.org/2015/03/page/2/#_msocom_1)\n\nIn Ward 4, Mayor Bowser has cranked up the Green Machine, the ward's formidable Democratic organization, in support of her hand-picked successor Brandon Todd, whose principal qualification is his service to Bowser as a campaign and Council aide. Ward 4 has slipped into something resembling monarchy, starting in 2007 when Adrian Fenty, leaving his Ward 4 seat to take office as Mayor, tapped Bowser as his successor and put his electoral machine at her service. During Fenty's four-year battle with DC unions, especially those representing teachers, he had in Bowser a reliable ally on the Council. Now Bowser is seeking to give Todd a leg-up, regardless of what voters of the ward might think, and [*Todd's 10-to-one fundraising advantage over his closest rival*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/bowser-backed-candidates-hold-big-fundraising-leads-in-dc-council-races/2015/02/03/c7bdfc80-abc0-11e4-9c91-e9d2f9fde644_story.html) is thanks to his patron's influence.\n\nBowser is also hoping to extend her influence to Ward 8, where she has thrown her weight behind former Barry aide [*LaRuby May, who also enjoys a huge fundraising edge*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/bowser-backed-candidates-hold-big-fundraising-leads-in-dc-council-races/2015/02/03/c7bdfc80-abc0-11e4-9c91-e9d2f9fde644_story.html) over her gaggle of rivals. But other ward activists are looking for a more old-fashioned kind of coronation – the elevation of Barry's son, Marion C. Barry (who was known as Christopher Barry before his father's death when his political ambition kicked in). Those pinning their hopes on the younger Barry do so despite his seeming to possess none of his father's political skills or vision but all of his penchant for generating bad headlines, and then some: [*Earlier this year, Marion C. was arrested for threatening a bank clerk, and, like his father, he has a history with illegal drugs – having pleaded guilty a few years ago to possessing marijuana and PCP*](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/christopher-barry-son-late-mayor-review-article-1.2077811). His political resume is largely a blank slate.\n\nIf one looks beyond the mayoral endorsements and familiar names, the huge fields of candidates offer numerous hopefuls with promising backgrounds if not prospects to match. In Ward 8, Nate Bennett-Fleming is making a second run for the Council, having lost the Democratic at-large primary last year to Anita Bonds. Fleming was an able advocate for DC statehood in his single term as statehood (or \"shadow\") representative to the House of Representatives. Also in Ward 8, Eugene D. Kinlow runs on his record of advocating DC voting representation in Congress as a staff*\\[Cc2\\]* member for DC Vote. Sheila Bunn is running on a thick resume that includes stints as aides to former Mayor Vince Gray and Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton.\n\nIn Ward 4, Renee L. Bowser (no relation to the mayor) is making a second run for Council, having lost to the other Bowser in the 2007 special election. Bowser, an advisory neighborhood commissioner and a former attorney for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, is championing strengthened workers' rights and affordable housing programs. Pedro Rubio Jr., a past council candidate, is hoping to become DC's first Latino councilmember by taking up former Councilmember Tommy Wells' \"livable, walkable city\" crusade.\n\nThese are not the only \"outsider\" candidates worth considering; many of them are still shaping their platforms and priorities. But will these voices get a fair shot in a campaign that is shaping up to be dominated by machine politics, money and name recognition? Although the pols have been picking their favorites, progressive organizations that plan to make endorsements – including the Metropolitan Washington Council AFL-CIO – are still scrutinizing the choices.\n\n**Bowser Pulls Plug on Franklin School Arts Center**\n\nMayor Bowser's decision to scuttle the planned arts center in the Franklin School, the landmark 1869 building at 13<sup>th</sup> and K St. NW, may be a troubling portent of the priorities of her two-month-old administration. The old school, which has been unoccupied since Mayor Fenty closed the homeless shelter there in 2008, has been eyed hungrily\nby developers due to the commercial potential of the structure and its\ncentral location. However, Mayor Gray's administration backed proposals put forward by nonprofit arts groups, which would include using the site for arts education for children. [*As Philip Kennicott reported in the *Washington Post*,*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/a-setback-for-dc-arts-and-culture-years-in-the-making/2015/02/16/94371d20-b3b7-11e4-854b-a38d13486ba1_story.html) developers interested in the site contributed heavily to Bowser's election campaign and inauguration. One could argue that an arts center may not be the best use of a downtown space – the former homeless shelter addressed a more pressing need – but at least it preserved the building for public use, unlike those who would turn it into a hotel or a high-end retail center. If this is an early indication of how Bowser will treat public properties, it will be a happy one for deep-pocketed developers but for no one else.\n\n**Marijuana Legalization Moves Ahead, then Backward**\n\nIn the wake of attempts by Congress to undo last November's voter initiative to fully legalize marijuana in the District, the DC Council fell into its time-honored pattern of mild defiance followed by hasty retreat. In the face of a rider in the DC appropriations bill stating that the District could not use local funds to \"enact\" the measure, DC officials said they would nevertheless move ahead with legalization, since voters had already \"enacted\" the measure at the ballot box. But last month, at the urging of newly elected DC Attorney General Karl Racine, the Council cancelled a planned hearing on how to regulate legal marijuana over concerns that this would violate the congressional restriction. As a result, as legalization took effect on Feb. 26, uncertainty reigned as to exactly when and where one could possess or use marijuana, and there were no guidelines for commercial cultivation or sale. Meanwhile, congressional Republicans who opposed legalization threatened Mayor Bowser with legal action for allowing the initiative to move forward. This battle has a long future, and if nothing else it may convince more District residents of the urgency of getting DC out from under the thumb of Congress.\n\n**DC More United on Budget Autonomy**\n\nOn a happier note, it seems that the [*mayor and Council may now be on the same page when it comes to challenging Congress on the need to free the District's budget from the congressional appropriations process*](http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/looselips/2015/02/13/bowser-could-back-budget-autonomy-amendment/). In 2013, DC voters approved a referendum declaring that DC would henceforth spend its own locally raised funds free of congressional interference, as the governments of all 50 states do. Whether the vote would pass constitutional muster was in grave doubt – the Constitution gives Congress authority over all DC legislation – but as a political matter, it at showed that patience of DC voters with federal meddling in its affairs (such as the marijuana referendum) was at an end. Yet Mayor Gray sided with ever-cautious DC Attorney General Irving Nathan and challenged the city's own referendum in court, choosing to support legalistic reasoning over the fight for democracy. However, Mayor Bowser has publicly indicated that she is rethinking Gray and Nathan's position, a strong hint that her office may drop the challenge and present a united front with the Council in demanding budget autonomy. If so, this would be a welcome development; instead of meekly asking for its rights, DC government and its citizens need to demand them.\n\n[*February Salon Examines the State of Greek Politics on the Threshold of Crisis*](http://dsadc.org/salon-examines-the-state-of-greek-politics-on-the-threshold-of-crisis/)\n\nSunday, March 1st, 2015\n\n**The Washington Socialist&lt;&gt;March 2015**\n\nSimon Davis, a DSA ally who grew up in and got his bachelor's degree in economics in Greece, led the DSA Salon discussion on the financial crisis and the rise of the radical Syriza party in the midst of wide public discontent with the crushing effect of austerity measures dictated by the country's (mostly Northern European) creditors. Just a few days after the Salon discussion, Syriza's coalition gained a four-month breather on their required loan repayments – an outcome variously characterized as a defeat or a partial victory for the beleaguered nation.\n\nDavis provided ***WS*** with the notes with which he led off the conversation:\n\n**How do you pronounce Syriza?**\n\nPer [*Paul Mason*](https://twitter.com/paulmasonnews/status/557670343142559745) on twitter: \"Like Syria but with a Z\"\n\n**What is Syriza and where did it come from?** (from Dimitris Bounias [*writing for *The Nation**](http://m.thenation.com/article/195441-syriza-rising))\n\n\"Syriza, or the Coalition of the Radical Left, is the product of a turbulent series of realignments on the Greek left outside the ranks of the KKE, the veteran Moscow-oriented Communist Party. Its origins can be traced to the coalition that was formed in 1989 between the Communists and the reformed left wing, which (after the Communists' departure) joined with other Marxist, Trotskyist, Green, feminist and independent groups. Popular in intellectual and cultural circles, it had little success at the polls (SD note: typically around 4-5%) until the crisis propelled it to second place in the elections of 2012.\n\nSyriza still has many Marxist voices among its active members (including the party's head of economic policy), and the red flag and five-pointed star in its logo will forever scare away the anticommunists. But its internal debate about whether to stay in the eurozone was largely settled by 2012; since then, its rhetoric has been both softened and streamlined. The party that once vowed to tear up the bailout agreement and nationalize the banks now speaks in a more unified and conciliatory voice, affirming its commitment to Europe while promising to open tough new negotiations with the lenders.\"\n\n**Does this win mean Greeks turned radical leftist within the space of a few years? **\n\nNo. A comparison of the [*2009*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_2009) and the [*2015*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_legislative_election,_2015) election results shows that Syriza largely took over old PASOK center-left strongholds.\n\nHere is how party leader Alexis Tsipras himself discussed the issue at [*Brookings on Jan 2013*](http://www.brookings.edu/%7E/media/events/2013/1/22%20greece%20economy/20130122_tsipras_transcript.pdf):\n\nreece is a country with the uniqueness of having two large parties in its political scene — what we call the Democratic and the Conservative party. In years past, this was the difference between the Venizelists and the Royalists\n\nDuring the National Resistance, which was a great moment in Greek history, the democratic side fought on the side of freedom and progress and identified itself with the National Liberation Front. After the civil war — as you know, history is usually written by the victors — there was a continuation of this tradition. Historical analysts say that the Democratic Party in our country always was the majority. And following the dictatorship, this group was won over by Andreas Papandreou. And many say that he copied slogans from the radical left.\n\nToday, following the unfortunate choices of George Papandreou and the tragic path taken by our country, this political area is now being represented by SYRIZA, a party that does not abandon its traditions, its values, and all its beliefs from the left; however, it meets together with other parties from the socialist side and wants to express a younger generation and the social strata that are the middle class but especially, the poor class, that is being disparaged by this economic crisis, who are on the fringes of society. And unfortunately, it's a large part of the population.\"\n\nFun fact also from that Brookings talk: The precursor to the current center right New Democracy was called the [*National Radical Union*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Radical_Union).\n\n**So what will Syriza try to do, and what are the odds it might happen?**\n\nFirst and foremost achieve a favorable renegotiation of the current troika programme. Per FinMin Varoufakis and other analysts, same principal on bonds, lower interest, extended maturity, lower primary surplus targets, rollback on required reforms, and some kind of commitment to growth strategies for the economy. This is a far cry from his [*Modest Proposal*](http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/euro-crisis/modest-proposal/) which is an EU-wide plan that is quite sensible indeed, but Greece needs immediate relief.\n\nAs of right now, Greece applied for a 6 month loan extension broadly under those terms and ECB+European Commission seemed OK with it, but Germany seems unconvinced and wants more concessions. It's anyone's guess what it will take to sway the Germans right now, but Greece has committed to an EU/Euro course and shown good faith. Next days are crucial.\n\nOn the other domestic policies, expect less police state, improved human rights policies, but no strong butting heads with the powerful Orthodox Church. Likewise oligarchs will probably not be fought, at least not right away. Syriza leaders have cited Latin America as their model for Left reform, so expect that–as well as pragmatism about EU, NATO, and long term strategic interests to guide decision making.\n\n**Additional reading:**\n\n*NY Times* op-ed by Kostas Vaxevanis: \"[*Greece's Rotten Oligarchy*](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/opinion/greeces-rotten-oligarchy.html?_r=0)\"\n\n*Washington Post* Wonkblog: \"[*Greece Really Might Leave the Euro*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/30/greece-really-might-leave-the-euro/)\"\n\nYanis Varoufakis: \"[*A Modest Proposal for Resolving the Eurozone Crisis – Version 4.0*](http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/euro-crisis/modest-proposal/)\"\n\n(Long read) Michael Pettis: \"*Syriza and the French indemnity of 1871-73*\"\n\n***Simon Davis, a DC resident, writes for* VICE USA *and is active with the Center for Inquiry.***\n\n[*Good Reads for Socialists*](http://dsadc.org/good-reads-for-socialists-2/)\n\nSunday, March 1st, 2015\n\n***The Washington Socialist*&lt;&gt;March 2015**\n\n**We devoted our February Salon to the Greek finance crisis**, just days before the newly elected Syriza-led coalition got a four-month extension on loan payments.

Even the great hero Hercules eventually suffers a tortured death after he dons the poisoned shirt of the Centaur Nessus; the Titan Prometheus, the benefactor of all humankind, is chained to a mountain in the Caucasus where a giant eagle tears repeatedly at his liver, for eons. The bloody robber Procrustes straps victims to a cramped bed and lops off protruding limbs to make them fit. And the Athenian warrior king Theseus, hoping to rescue his city from paying an annual tribute of young men and maidens to King Minos of Crete, faces a flesh-eating monster, the Minotaur, in a huge underground labyrinth where escape initially seems unimaginable.\n\nWhat even the most terrible old Greek tales generally lack, though, is an appreciation for the kinds of torture that can be inflicted by modern capitalist financial relationships and government institutions enforcing them. In *Crisis in the Eurozone,* the Greek Marxist political economist Costas Lapavitsas and several colleagues at the University of London help correct this deficiency. In this book, they describe the institutions and the social and economic results of the Eurozone project in dry, unemotional prose that might be lifted from a bank auditor's report; yet the picture that emerges evokes much of the \"pity and terror\" that the bloody, tragic ancient myths inspire.\n\nSince the global financial crisis began unfolding in 2007, initially as a result of speculative trading in mortgage-backed securities in the United States, the Eurozone as a totality has experienced severe economic shocks. The weaker, smaller economies at the periphery of the European Monetary Union or EMU –those of Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland, and Italy – have experienced a long season in hell, which continues today with barely a pause. As Lapavitsas writes in the preface to this volume, the rules and structure of the Eurozone have \"grossly magnified the recessionary forces present in the European economy,\" and the burden of paying for the crisis has been passed to the European working class in the form of \"reduced wages and pensions, higher unemployment, unraveling of the welfare state, deregulation and privatization.\"\n\nThe so-called troika consisting of the Eurozone countries, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the European Central Bank (ECB), have imposed drastic austerity in the name of supposedly helping the indebted periphery governments recover economically, and the austerity hasn't worked. Greece, perhaps the hardest hit economy, has now suffered from five years of depression with unemployment exceeding 25 percent and youth unemployment reaching 50 percent. A large fraction of the population is in poverty. That's why the new leftwing political coalition Syriza, to the dismay of the Troika, won the recent Greek elections, and why Syriza leader Alex Tsipras has recently been demanding a renegotiation of Greece's financial program with the country's creditors – although with how much success seems unclear at this writing. At press time Syriza's late-February deal with the \"troika\" to forestall loan payments four months is being declared a victory for austerity by some and a tactical advance for Syriza's anti-austerity drive by others, with opinion ranging widely in both the financial and mainstream press\n\nWhy have things unraveled so badly for Greece and other weak economies in the EMU?\n\nBeginning in around 2009, when the ripple effects of the \"subprime\" mortgage crisis in the United States began to threaten the European banks, the weaker European economies suffered their own financial crisis, and to keep their private banks from collapsing and triggering further catastrophe, the governments of Greece, Spain and other peripheral economies went deeply into debt themselves to bail out their banks. Yet their rescue efforts, like the labors of Sisyphus, may have been futile, for their creditors – chiefly large banks in Germany and France – quickly became alarmed by their rising public debts, and international speculators began making bets against Greek government bonds, hoping to make a killing. Meanwhile the Eurozone's rules, although they have not always been strictly enforced for stronger economies at the European core, mandate strict limits on government deficits. Greece and several governments in the periphery were quickly deemed in violation of these rules.\n\nThe upshot is that since 2010, when a major rescue package was put in place for Greece, the Greek government, to placate its creditors, has been required to impose sweeping austerity measures on its citizens, as have the governments of Portugal and Spain, among others. In fact, governments across the Eurozone, including in the stronger economies of the core, have adopted austerity programs of varying severity. Rather than fighting the recession with deficit spending, they have restricted public social expenditures and public employment, adopted more \"flexible\" labor regulations and the like, to reduce deficits or increase surpluses.\n\nYet because such austerity measures have reduced total spending, the EU in the last year has come dangerously close to falling into a condition of persistent \"deflation,\" which to some economists is mostly a polite word for serious recession. And in Greece, the recession has turned into the Greek Depression, which in turn has increased rather than reduced the debt in proportion to the size of the economy.\n\nFor years, economists such as Nobel laureate Paul Krugman and Dean Baker, along with some European politicians and leftists, have been calling for a redesign of the Eurozone to deal with these problems, and especially to reduce the cost to labor in general and the working people of the periphery in particular. As noted, Syriza won control of the Greek government by vowing to fight for a relaxation of the harsh austerity agreements now governing their nation's relations with its creditors, whose financial help Athens needs to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nYet the German government, as this goes to press, so far refuses to cut Syriza much slack, and to Lapavitsas and other members of the Research on Money and Finance (RMF) group who collectively composed *Crisis in the Eurozone,* persistent hopes within the European left for a kinder, gentler Eurozone are likely an illusion. The Eurozone as it exists is \"unsustainable,\" this book argues, and it is unsustainable primarily because of the class interests of the European financial elites who constructed it.\n\nAs Lapavitsas puts it in his preface, the Eurozone exists because \"The ruling strata of Europe have been determined to create a form of money capable of competing against the dollar in the world market, and thereby furthering the interests of large European banks and enterprises.\" To allow the euro to serve as such a global reserve currency, the elites designed the Eurozone to be resistant to inflation as well as high government debts, and this goal has generally militated against European governments employing Keynesian monetary and fiscal measures to control the business cycle, leading to intractable recessions.\n\nIn particular, by mandating the use of a single currency in 19 very different economies with differing levels of development, the Eurozone has taken away a traditional tool that governments could otherwise use to restore their global competitiveness: currency devaluation, which makes their exports cheaper and imports more expensive. With Greece and other Eurozone members unable to devalue national currencies to address problems with competitiveness, and with Keynesian stimulus ruled out, the primary way Eurozone members can boost their international competitiveness is through reducing both their imports and their labor costs. Given the lack of any alternative short of leaving the euro, many have done so – at a severe cost both to labor and the general population.\n\nIronically, though, financially the strongest economy in the Eurozone at the moment, Germany, has been more successful than the weaker members, such as Greece, at reducing labor costs over the years. This is partly because Germany was more technically developed to begin with and partly because its workers enjoy higher average incomes, making reductions in them easier. For this and other reasons, including some biases built into the way value of the euro was initially established against those of various national currencies, German exports have been far more competitive within a Eurozone context than Greek, Portuguese or Spanish exports.\n\nIn an effort to maintain adequate consumer demand and national economic growth, therefore, the weaker economies of the Eurozone before 2007 mostly stimulated economies by running up debts – in some cases, to their own banks, but in many cases to the banks of Germany and other core EU countries. In the case of Spain, the debts mostly propped up a real estate investment bubble comparable to the one that prevailed before 2007 in the US. In the case of Greece, individual households stopped saving and racked up debts in order to support enhanced consumer spending, while the government also increased its debts while, with the help of Goldman Sachs, hiding this from its foreign creditors.\n\nBefore 2007, the German bankers didn't mind the rising indebtedness of the Eurozone periphery, for they were profiting from it. The low inflation rate in the EU made it cheap for them to obtain capital to lend, while the rules of the Eurozone seemed to protect them against the risks of default. The money the German and other banks lent to the economies of the periphery also mostly returned to the core European economies to pay for German (and other) exports. This made the EU initially seem like a \"win-win\" proposition for Greek households and Spanish real estate developers, as well as German and Dutch bankers.\n\nThe U.S. financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 and the Eurozone financial crisis that followed from it, however, have destroyed this arrangement, in part because the German banks that lent heavily to Greece and other peripheral Eurozone economies also were heavily involved in speculating on subprime mortgage-backed securities in the US. When the American bubble in mortgage-backed securities popped, the German bankers suddenly were looking at red ink on their balance sheets. Along with their interest in fighting European inflation to maintain the euro as a viable competitor with the dollar, their own dire straits contributed to their taking a hard line against concessions to their borrowers, including Greece and other peripheral Eurozone members.\n\nThe result, according to Lapavitsas and his collaborators, is that the weaker members of the Eurozone as well as European labor in general face a future of endless depression. And yet they argue that like Theseus in his battle with the Minotaur, the weaker countries of the Euro periphery might escape from the terrible and deadly maze in which they are trapped. Unfortunately, though, their most likely escape route is itself painful and dangerous.\n\nOnly through a breaking out of the Eurozone, the authors submit, can the Greeks in particular and the European working class in general hope for a more positive future. The indebted Greek government could help to trigger such a breakup either by defaulting on its debts and quitting the Eurozone, or through being forced into default by its creditors. Since there are no set provisions for any member economy leaving the Eurozone, a Greek departure could cause the whole thing to break apart – which to Lapavitsas and his collaborators, would ultimately be a good thing.\n\nThe question then becomes how to do it. To the authors of this book, a Greek exit from the Eurozone could be \"chaotic, undertaken at the last moment ... with minimal preparation,\" which would impose substantial additional costs on Greek society and its economy. It also could be conservative,\" in the sense of being led by private interests \"keen to protect the existing balance of social forces,\" who would continue to enforce economic austerity. Or there might be a \"progressive\" exit that favors labor over capital, with Greece voluntarily and deliberately defaulting and leaving the Eurozone while taking a number of radical steps to lessen the pain of the inevitable aftermath.\n\nFor a \"progressive\" exit to work well, the authors state, Greece would have to adopt \"a broad programme including, at the very least, public ownership and control over financial institutions, control over capital flows, income and wealth redistribution, sustained industrial policy to protect employment and ensure growth, and total restructuring of the state in a democratic direction.\" Such a progressive and indeed radical exit strategy, if it could be carried out successfully, \"could put profound social change on the agenda for the first time in decades,\" and help a battered European labor movement move into a position of ascendancy over European capital.\n\nThere is much else in this rather complicated account of the Eurozone and its economic woes that is impossible to summarize here, and it might be useful if local DSA members with professional economics training would examine this book in some detail to investigate the many nuances in the argument that I may have missed.\n\nBut even for a reviewer of limited economic background such as myself, it's clear that Lapavitsas and his RMF colleagues are charting a possible course for Greece that is far more radical than anything that Syriza and its supporters among the Greek people are proposing at this point in their confrontation with their creditors. It seems unlikely at this moment that the Greek government is going to follow anything like this book's suggested course of action in the foreseeable future.\n\nUnfortunately, if Lapavitsas and his colleagues are correct, the more moderate attempts at reforming the Eurozone that Syriza and most of the Social Democratic parties of Europe are currently willing to pursue are doomed to failure. For the sake of the European working class and for the sake of Americans, too, perhaps DSA members should hope that Lapavitsas and his colleagues are wrong, since their way forward — precisely because it would be more radical than merely asking Greece's creditors for a little mercy — seems so difficult to for Greece to achieve and for its creditors to accept.","order":3},{"title":"Maryland: A Pro-worker Vision of the Future Hijacked by the Neoliberal Agenda","date":"2015-03-01","issue":"March 2015","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"Austerity is, of course, a constant refrain at the state level as well as federal. As we see below, austerity to protect power and preserve inequality is solemnized at many different levels and official, expert-authority is invoked every time: Simpson-Bowles, for an egregious example. Maryland offers another example of the ways that the neoliberal agenda gets reproduced in apparently neutral government operations – as well as the ways it can sometimes get subverted.\n\nMaryland's economy has not kept up with even the feeble recovery that is flickering throughout the US, largely because of its dependence on federal government employment and ancillary federal contracting by the well-known \"Beltway Bandits,\" the private-sector companies that batten off the activities of often-overburdened government agencies.\n\nA particularly tough hit for Maryland was the sequestration of Defense Department spending of the past several fiscal years – a sector on which the state has particularly depended for jobs and taxable cash flow. Even Montgomery County, with the least conservative political culture in the state, found itself approving a craven tax break to keep Lockheed from moving some economic activities out of the county.\n\nThen a Republican snuck away with the governorship in November 2014 with a metronomic claim that taxes were too high, and that the state wasn't business-friendly – coupled with a collapse of turnout in Democratic strongholds.\n\nAbout a week after the election, a commission tasked with shaping up the state's economic climate and business development approach held its eighth and last meeting; [*its report was eventually submitted in February*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/Pubs/CommTFWorkgrp/MEDBCC-Report-12Feb2015-revised.pdf). Attendees at that final meeting heard from the reliable and evenhanded legislative services budgetmeister Warren Descheneaux about the state's structural deficit and shortfall for the coming budget year. So in a potent climate of austerity and tax-cutting fever, the commissioners (and, thankfully, legislative services staffers) began to prepare their report. What's kind of amazing is how much worse it could have been. The story of how the commission first came about did not give cause for optimism – at least from the progressive point of view.\n\nIt starts in last year's legislative session, when a [*fairly visionary and populist proposal*](http://dsadc.org/maryland-looks-at-formal-state-body-on-defense-transition/) entered the scrum. It would have created a Maryland Futures Commission with a goal to survey alternative, non-defense sources of jobs, economic activity and delivery of public goods for the state. The proposed bill actually contained the dread phrase \"industrial policy\" in the mission \"...to develop plans and policies to ensure a competitive advantage for Maryland as Federal military spending declines.\" The initiative for the bill came from Fund Our Communities, a Peace Action offshoot that was explicitly dedicating to shifting military funding to human needs. The goal was to use Maryland's forced weaning from the defense-industry teat to bring a different set of economic priorities. The hope was to empanel a diverse commission, including labor, nonprofits and activists as well as the inevitable usual suspects from business and politics.\n\nThe bill in the 2014 session had [*solid support*](http://dsadc.org/an-update-on-marylands-legislature/) from progressive legislators and held its own in hearings, aided by testimony from defense scholar Miriam Pemberton of the Institute for Policy Studies and backed by a resolution from the state AFL-CIO citing \"growing need for programs of economic conversion.\"\n\nBut the effort was [*hijacked, denatured and derailed*](http://dsadc.org/maryland-legislature-showy-but-hard-on-workers-and-the-poor/) by the fiat of the two Mikes, the leaders of the House (Speaker Mike Busch) and Senate (President Mike Miller). Where the Maryland's Future commission would have been a diverse group including unions, peace and justice organizations and other pro-worker and antimilitarist groups, Busch and Miller unilaterally announced the creation of a \"Maryland Economic Development and Business Climate Commission\" populated entirely\nby representatives of the power structure in the state and chaired by\nnone other than the retired chairman of Lockheed Corp., Norman Augustine. Both leaders called it the \"Augustine Commission.\" The Futures Commission bill was withdrawn to clear the way for the leadership's stacked-deck commission.\n\nThe Assembly, despite muted howls of outrage from progressive members, followed the leaders as well last year in dialing back the impact of the state's estate tax on the grounds that it would drive millionaires to set their residence in some other, lower-tax haven and vanish from the Free State's tax rolls. That episode seemed a good indicator of the direction of the new commission: protect power.\n\nThe commission was supposed to report in December 2014 but filed only an interim report in February of this year, apparently because the two Assembly leaders were so impressed with their work that they gave them till September 2015 and – ominously – expanded their mandate to a complete review of tax structure with \"a comprehensive review of Maryland's State and local business-related taxes and tax incentives.\"\n\nThe classic neoliberal trickle-down theory was in full play. In a cover letter to the interim report, Augustine carefully noted that \"The prosperity of Maryland businesses will *in most instances* lead to the creation of jobs for the State's citizens.\" (emphasis added). As a leader of the entrenched culture of the development-first community, he whined that it was the \"entrenched culture\" of the state's executive agencies that was upholding the state's rep as unfriendly to business, presumably because those state government workers were conscious of having other constituents than just businessmen.\n\nThe interim report has enough in it to chill the blood and confirm that the fix was in when this commission was first composed. As noted in the *Washington Socialist* last year, [*the commission's membership was entirely conventional, largely elite and business-friendly*](http://dsadc.org/maryland-legislative-roundup-mike-mike-kill-a-bill/). The one labor representative was a national AFL-CIO rep with expertise in apprenticeship programs. The testimony the commission heard in eight public hearings around the state came from a homogeneous business crowd.\n\nThere is a permanent war between organized business interests and the state agency bureaucrats who regulate them that is very well represented in the findings and recommendations of the commission. Most of those who testified at the public hearings were business persons of various sorts; there were few representatives of workers or consumers.\n\nStill, the Augustine Commission's report has tolerable recommendations, in particular some that will be distinctly uncomfortable for Larry Hogan, the new Republican governor. For one thing, it offers a ringing call for not only restoration of the cuts Hogan has proposed for both higher ed and K-12 schools but for increased funding. For another, the proposals in aggregate all but specifically endorse industrial policy – picking and supporting winners among the state's existing and nascent businesses and industries. The proposals for aligning the state's workforce with the needs of business and industry also show a strong bias toward planning for future markets rather than just bending over backwards for existing corporate powers – the section on apprenticeships references the successful German model.\n\nThe several voices – likely those of members and of professional staff – that emerge in the report show savvy staff work from the Legislative Services division, which provides fact-based analysis that has always kept the legislators as honest as they can be kept. The commission members were essentially stacked in favor of the business community, and Augustine's cover letter to the interim (February) report and the preamble to the report itself distill the complaints of the businessmen interviewed: Those state bureaucrats just don't have the right attitude toward promoting economic development; they are slow, they are too cautious, they won't allow \"common-sense exceptions\" to the regulations, and they give Maryland its reputation as unfriendly to business. As the introduction states, \"Maryland's primary economic vulnerability was characterized by almost all of the executives who appeared before MEDBCC to be an unfriendly, or at best indifferent, business environment.\" But what else might one expect from a stacked deck of testimony?\n\nThis complaint comes, incongruously, in the midst of a quite progressive account of the nature of competition that leads off the report. It suggests that attracting existing businesses into the state – head-hunting at the corporate scale – is the \"least attractive option\" and generally benefits the business being solicited rather than the states engaged in the race to the bottom. The report also notes the new economy's \"disconcerting\" tendency to generate e-commerce capitalization but not jobs, citing but not naming Instagram's billion-dollar IPO valuation with a mere 13 employees.\n\nThe competitiveness discussion shows other signs of staff input that subverts the market-fundamentalist neoliberal overlay of the commission's charge: \"The state must prioritize which industries it must pursue to be competitive\" and the crucial factor of research, which \"often will not be pursued without government intervention.\" State funding of technological development is recommended to rise significantly as the state works its way out of its current budget hole.\n\nThere are, however, plenty of neoliberal ambushes embedded in the overall report and its recommendations. For instance, a joint committee of the legislature is proposed to gain authority to forestall any state agency ruling that could have \"meaningful\" negative impact on small businesses, throwing the decision to the governor. That could be a barrier to future minimum wage increases, or to the earned sick leave bill that is having its third hopeful incarnation during this session after two failures. This year's sick leave bill, HB 385, is said in the fiscal note attached to have a \"meaningful\" small business impact. One of the five bills filed for this session that are acknowledged to have come directly from the recommendations of the Augustine Commission establishes that tougher standard for regulations that have small business impact via a commission \"led by an advisory commission that includes private sector stakeholders.\" [*(SB 775/HB 939)*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?id=sb0775&stab=01&pid=billpage&tab=subject3&ys=2015RS)\n\nSeveral other unpromising recommendations-turned-bills include customer-training service for the allegedly rude and unsympathetic regulatory employees of the state and the creation of a Secretary of Commerce to oversee combined economic development agencies that, the commission found, are disjointed and stovepiped. Among the potentially helpful recommendations, a bill to pilot a German-style apprenticeship program has skimpy House support ([*HB 942*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?pid=billpage&tab=subject3&id=hb0942&stab=01&ys=2015RS)) but a massive set of cosponsors in the Senate ([*SB 772*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?pid=billpage&tab=subject3&id=sb0772&stab=01&ys=2015RS)), including many progressive stalwarts like Madaleno, Ramirez and Pinsky (but not Manno or Raskin). A bill that might enhance the role of university research (or become an intellectual-property Hoover) is called a \"task force to improve technology transfer from higher education into the marketplace.\" SB 941 and [*HB 773*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?id=sb0773&stab=01&pid=billpage&tab=subject3&ys=2015RS) would investigate the possibility of explicitly bypassing ethics requirements to speed up this process.\n\nWhat's missing in the report? The recommendations for boosting science and technology research and business development are rife in the commission's plan for the future, but there is zero mention of the value of alternative energy R&D or the \"green jobs\" that could be grown through that – a remarkable omission since Maryland has during the previous administration fused government action, private business activity and sustained environmental activism toward those goals.\n\nAs for the commission's extended mission – \"examine the business tax and incentive structure in Maryland,\" as described by the two legislative honchos in a Feb. 12 press release – working people and consumers will always be on the losing end when only those aspects of the tax system are under inspection.\n\nThe \"Augustine Commission\" report shows an uneven fealty to the kind of market-fundamentalist view that the GOP governor, Hogan, appears to be bringing to the fray (along with a distressing number of holdover hard-liners from the Ehrlich administration). A good deal of the story yet to be written will be framed by which among its recommendations make it into law in this and future legislative sessions. The episodes so far have a depressing familiarity: the trappings of deliberation are used to make a *fait accompli* seem like a reason-based process. Progressives can be happy, at least, that the Hogan-proposed education cuts that have outraged both House and Senate get a clear repudiation from this report, and that an activist approach to job generation and industrial policy is cautiously endorsed. But overall, it's another example of how the capitalist agenda has a way of colonizing governance.","order":4},{"title":"PEPCO-Exelon Deal Provides Focus to Feb. 15 General Meeting","date":"2015-03-01","issue":"March 2015","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"Thanks to unexpectedly cold weather, the scheduled general meeting of the Metro DC chapter of DSA almost didn't happen. Our scheduled speaker was Dave Freeman, aka the \"Green Cowboy,\" a former chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and former manager of several large, publicly owned electric utilities. Freeman had expressed some eagerness to talk to local democratic socialists about the history and the potential future of publicly owned power systems in the United States, but on the morning of Sunday, Feb. 15 he called us to say that he would speak as scheduled if we preferred, but he thought attendance would be sparse due to the single-digit weather, and he really thought we should cancel the meeting. He also confessed that at age 89, he was rather reluctant to brave the cold weather himself.\n\nAfter a somewhat frenzied consultation by phone, several members of the local Steering Committee agreed we should cancel Freeman's presentation, but hold the meeting anyway to avoid disappointing any DSA members and supporters who turned up for it. At the last minute, we also persuaded Marchant Wentworth, a green energy consultant and a former campaign manager for the Union of Concerned Scientists, to speak on the proposed merger of PEPCO into the Chicago-based utility generating utility Exelon, as a substitute for Freeman's presentation.\n\nDespite a last-minute room shift upstairs in the Shaw library, 13 people found their way to the Feb. 15 meeting, including Wentworth, a curious libertarian conservative and a representative of the climate activist group 350.org in Loudoun County. Attendees had a good discussion of the proposed PEPCO-Exelon deal. With DSA members Andy Feeney and Woody Woodruff providing some backup, Wentworth led the discussion of what the deal would mean for local utility ratepayers as well as advocates for green and renewable energy.\n\nMajor points that emerged from the discussion mostly reflect those that the *Washington Socialist* explored in two articles on the proposed merger in our last issue, concerning recent hearings on the proposal before [*the D.C*](http://dsadc.org/dc-utility-watchdogs-ratepayers-climate-activists-unite-in-opposing-proposed-pepco-exelon-merger/). and [*Maryland*](http://dsadc.org/beneficiaries-line-up-to-praise-exelon-pepco-merger-ratepayers-not-so-much/) public service commissions. In addition, Wentworth made the point that \"takeover\" really is a better description of the proposed deal than \"merger.\"\n\nIf it gains local regulatory approval for the deal, Wentworth pointed out, Exelon would acquire PEPCO by paying its stockholders a significantly above-market price for its outstanding stock. The stockholders would obviously benefit, but to make a reasonable profit on the deal, Exelon would then need to get additional revenue from operating PEPCO's existing distribution system. The most logical way in which it could get that added revenue would be through passing on the relatively high costs of Exelon's existing fleet of 23 nuclear power plants to local ratepayers, at a significant premium above what the average D.C. or suburban Maryland ratepayer is now paying for electricity.\n\nA fairly lively discussion of the takeover ensued, as well as of which local ratepayers are likely to be most affected by it, as well as its implications for local providers of what is called \"distributed\" power – electricity generated by small businesses and homeowners from their own solar panel or wind energy installations, which they can sell to PEPCO's existing distribution network when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing, so as to reduce their overall power bills while contributing renewable energy to the grid.\n\nExelon likes to boast that it operates some solar electric generation of its own, but it is on record as opposing \"distributed\" power in a number of states where it operates. Its motivation for doing so is obvious, since locally-produced distributed power competes with the power generated from its large nuclear fleet, costing its stockholders money.\n\n*Washington Socialist* readers interested in learning more about the proposed takeover of PEPCO are encouraged to refer to our stories from last issue for more details. In Maryland, the deadline for public comments on the proposed deal has passed, but the D.C. Public Service Commission will continue accepting public comments to its docket on the proposal up to March 26. Written statements by D.C. residents may be submitted by mail or in person to Brinda Westbrook-Sedgwick, Commission Secretary, Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia, 1333 H Street, N.W., Suite 200, West Tower, Washington DC 2005, or they can be emailed to [*PSC-CommissionSecretary@dc.gov*](mailto:PSC-CommissionSecretary@dc.gov), or submitted through the Commission's eDocket system at [*http://www.depsc.org/edocket.asp*](http://www.depsc.org/edocket.asp).\n\nThe D.C.

Much as activists within the civil rights and women's movement in the 1960s initially had little access to their rich histories, so today many activists — let alone the broader public — have little concrete knowledge or understanding of what the world looked and felt like to those confronting oppressive conditions before today's rights were won. And it is that lack of history that is so telling now, as what was gained is being taken away. Public discussion and understanding of how social struggles developed, how activists were formed, how decisions on strategy and tactics were made is critical to our ability not only to defend existing rights but to expand and extend them.\n\nEven though they are very different movies, each of these two films meaningfully contributes to the possibility of such discussion. *Selma* follows a traditional story-telling arc; Martin Luther King Jr.'s political and interpersonal struggles while organizing the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery March become the lens through which the drive to pass the Voting Rights Act is told. The strength of the movie is that the intersection of personality and movement makes history accessible in a manner often lost; King is portrayed as heroic (which indeed he was), but also as a part of a much wider movement with other heroic individual leaders and grassroots militants — and therefore part of a movement filled with many different and sometimes conflicting views and voices which nonetheless acted in concert. As in any such narrative, the imperative of story-telling makes the picture of history neater, more unilinear, than it was in reality; nonetheless, by showing meetings, arguments, debates through which decisions were made, audiences are given a more accurate picture of the past than works of history or fiction that focus on an individual or leader in isolation (or in opposition) to the social movements of their times. That is even more true of *She's Beautiful When She's Angry*, which documents the emergence, growth and diversity of Second Wave feminism — roughly from the early-1960s to the mid-1970s — through contemporary news footage and present-day interviews with key participants in Boston, New York, the Bay Area, Chicago, DC and elsewhere. Both of the nature of the documentary and the nature of the movement made any simple coherence hard to achieve, except in the profound sense that the multiplicity of leaders and locations and concerns was essential to the power and meaning of the struggle by women for women's rights. The narrative arc is the story as a whole and while it makes the film less immediately graspable than what could be achieved through a plot-driven tale, it provides a framework that allows a better sense of the inter-connection between individual voices and collective action.\n\nThe focus of each film on the relationship between people within social movements touches on a truth of how political change occurs — a truth often ignored by Hollywood. That lack makes highly ironic the criticisms of *Selma* by some over the depiction of Lyndon Johnson's role in the voter registration movement. Ironic given the almost complete lack of historical validity of the vast majority of historical films (such as in *Mississippi Burning*, turning truth upside down by pretending that the FBI wanted to discover and prosecute those who murdered civil rights workers, to cite but one of countless other examples) which are not attacked in the press. This it is not a question of documentary accuracy — it is a fictional account and does not pretend to be a footnoted work striving to get every detail right in the correct chronological order. Rather it is a film that strives to speak to the underlying truth of King and of the civil rights movement, of the poverty and violence, of the hope and vision, which inspired it. And thereby, *Selma* recaptures the anger at oppression and racism, anger often lost in \"feel good\" depictions of the era. So too, the superficial picture of a struggle that moved from victory to victory (Brown v. Bd. of Education, the March on Washington, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act), often ignores the sense of frustration as each gain was met by a violent intransigence that still left African Americans second-class citizens in their own country. As to the relationship between government and social movements, one need only note that Johnson, when Senate Majority leader in the 1950s, blocked meaningful civil rights legislation, legislation that he subsequently signed into law. It is to his credit that he did sign, but the change was not solely a personal one; rather it was the work of leaders, activists and organizations rooted in the black community that made the difference. If *Selma*, again because of the conventions of mainstream movie-making, can't completely bring the full dynamic of those relationships on the ground to the surface, it nonetheless comes far closer than most Hollywood movies, presenting a truer, more nuanced, more relevant version of our collective past than what viewers are ordinarily able to see on screen.\n\nAs noted, *She's Beautiful When She's Angry* presents multiple voices in order to present a history of a movement that brought such enormous sweeping changes that it is difficult for people today to grasp how ingrained, pervasive and accepted blatant, overt sexism had been. Rather than focusing on oneissue, group or leader, the film depicts various layers of challenges to existing structures and relationships manifested in all aspects of life. The essence of the impact the movement struck amongst women is shown in telling how a collective in Boston wrote *Our Bodies, Our Selves* — seeking self-knowledge they touched a chord amongst women across the country who, denied such knowledge in school and by society, made that work their own (and, in an inspiring segment of the movie, shows the influence it continues to have as women around the world have made the book their own, in numerous translations and rewritings).\n\nThe personal as political is shown not as a cliché but a necessity to challenge an overt sexual double standard that pervaded family relationships, job opportunities, university life, and political activism (even of the left). Help wanted ads, to cite but one example, were not only gender-specific — employers could all but ask for sexual favors; therefore the political demand for the end of such discrimination was a personal demand to have choice in life. And, as to choice, the film's recounting of the massive underground network providing safe places for women to have abortions in an era when such a referral system — let alone the practice — was itself illegal connected the intimate to collective action to demands for legal change. That connection was reinforced as the demand amongst Black and Puerto Rican women for the right to birth control was equally a demand against what was a widespread practice of forced sterilization. The film thereby depicts the distinctiveness within the women's movement of movements built by women also challenging the pervasive impact of racism and colonialism in their lives. Coming full circle to the challenge posed earlier by women against sexism in the civil rights and anti-war movements, within the New Left, *She's Beautiful When She's Angry* depicts the demand by lesbians that their insights, experiences and struggle against repression be brought out into the open not only within society but also within the activist community. Throughout, the enormous creativity of individuals who found a voice within themselves that otherwise would have been suppressed is shown, unique voices that would have been silenced unless nurtured by collectives of mutual support.\n\nIt was a creativity fueled too by an anger at the existence of such a double standard and inequality that faced — and still faces — such deep resistance when confronted. And this ties back to *Selma*, the anger, the near despair that made the determination to press forward all the more remarkable. Music (and poetry) within these two movies register in equal measure pain and aspiration that were and are as much a part of the journey as are meetings and demonstrations. Victories were won despite resistance from established power, although that power was able to limit the scope of social gains, thus laying the groundwork for the corporate and right-wing pushbacks against liberatory and egalitarian social justice.\n\nThat returns us to Johnson's legacy, for the inadequacy of LBJ's liberalism was demonstrated already in 1964 when he sought to maintain Democratic Party unity by trying to force an unsatisfactory compromise between civil rights activists and segregationists. The \"compromise\" prevented activists from building an interracial coalition of the poor within the Democratic Party, while concessions to racism did not keep the southern white establishment from moving en masse to the Republican Party. At the same time, his commitment to the war in Vietnam undermined his commitment for civil rights and to the war on poverty; a contradiction brought out in *Selma*. Unable to contain the strains of society brought about by demands for genuine equality, Johnson's presidency collapsed only a few years subsequent to the massive victory he won in 1964, a failure which set the stage for the subsequent drift toward a Democratic Party polity that has put anti-poverty and collective working-class social measures on the backburner. This was to have a corrosive impact on the black freedom movement – social equality was not only a value in itself, it was also understood as a means to the power that could address economic inequality that trapped millions of African Americans in lives of want. Therefore, the need to join the Voting Rights Act to the Civil Rights Act (as noted in the film), and the continued need to find an adequate framework through which to exercise political power (beyond the scope of this film).\n\nNixon's attempt to co-opt or placate social justice movements while simultaneously acting to reinforce existing hierarchies and inequalities was similarly unable to contain social activism but could forestall the goals of equality. The National Strike for Women's Equality in 1970, although not a centerpiece the way the Selma-to-Montgomery march is in *Selma*, nonetheless forms a highwater moment in *She's Beautiful When She's Angry*. The successful march was followed by a number of victories — perhaps the most significant of which was passage of a national system of child care. Nixon's veto of that legislation marked the beginning of the end of that progress (foreshadowing the subsequent defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment). The attempts to give lip service to reform without allowing substantive change to go forward was a contradiction, which, when combined with his attempt to \"win\" in Vietnam, led to the collapse on Nixon's presidency shortly after his massive victory in 1972. Nixon's policies, however, came to redefine the shape of Republican Party practices that took full form under Ronald Reagan; the onset of a reaction in all phases of US life. The political system stabilized by squeezing out hope of change through political action, though in the process we have been led from one social and economic crisis after another. The systemic attack on abortion rights — on the right to choice — in subsequent years was part of a general suppression of rights, of a general rise of insecurity, that have once again placed greater burdens on women. Gender inequality has been on the rise as both economic and social justice recede.\n\nAnd so the struggle continues — when *She's Beautiful When She's Angry* makes that explicit through references to women today fighting back against attacks on abortion rights, organizing for workplace rights amongst the most exploited, demonstrating against sexual violence through \"slut walks,\" fighting for equal rights in every meaning of the term. *Selma*, in turn, is being shown at a time when the Supreme Court's gutting of key provisions of the Voting Rights Act has opened the door to new and ever-more cynical forms of voter suppression. A song about Ferguson in the background as the film closes ties back to the devaluation of black lives remembered on screen in the opening, showing the death of four girls in a Birmingham, Alabama church bombing. \"Black Lives Matter\" has added meaning when thought is given to the murder of black and white civil rights activists during the Selma organizing, to the assassination of black leaders from Malcolm X to Martin Luther King.\n\nThe present is not the past, of course; changes made were genuine and meaningful even if limited. The partial gains registered then and under attack now sometimes cloud issues in the present which are often not as clearcut as in the years portrayed by these two movies. Reversing the content of the personal as political, social and economic suffering is now often seen and felt as a result of individual failure rather than as a consequence of structures designed to maintain hierarchies of inequality. Thus, as one younger woman put the matter, oppression has become more insidious. A new way forward will have to be found, a search that can only be helped by paying attention to what came before. Demands for equality in every phase of life are part and parcel of demands for economic justice — and if these are pulled asunder, then all suffer. Freedom, liberation, dignity, self-determination, define the dreams behind the struggles of the 1960s and 70s, in the striving for rights as individuals that could — and can — only be gained through structural change in our political and economic system. Organizing therefore ought to accommodate a multitude of concerns while also seeking the common interest embodied in universal programs. Contrary to the neo-liberal zeitgeist, social and individual rights, social and economic equality, are intertwined (an intertwining that is at the heart of the socialist project, as it is at the heart of all social justice activism). The legacy of the past that speaks most forcefully to our needs for the present is the need to coalesce multiple voices and struggles that push that connection in every sphere of life – and is the reason *Selma* and *She's Beautiful When She is Angry* should be seen and discussed.","order":6},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—March 2015 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"March 2015","order":-1,"date":"2015-03-02","body":"**Welcome to the March 2015 issue of the *Washington Socialist*, the online newsletter of Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America. **\n\nThe hope would be that things on the radical front will pick up in March – they have to – if only because of the number of events that were postponed in February due to the unusual weather.

Some of us heard him say, as he did so many times, that the future was of necessity going to hold \"socialism\" of some sort and it was up to us to determine what sort that would be – more humane or more authoritarian.

Bonds, a Democrat, was one of only two African Americans in the race, along with Perry Redd of the Statehood Green Party who was hardly a factor with less than 2 percent of the vote. In the fractured field, Bonds' 32 percent of the vote was enough to defeat fellow Democrat Elissa Silverman (at 28 percent) and Republican Patrick Mara (23 percent), with Democrats Matthew Frumin and Paul Zukerberg far behind. Bonds, to be sure, had more going for her than being the most prominent African American in the race; as a longtime local Democratic Party leader and an official serving under several DC mayors, she was clearly the candidate of the political establishment and had the endorsement of most DC councilmembers.\n\nThe racially polarized nature of the election is clearly seen in ward-by-ward results. In overwhelmingly white Ward 3 Bonds was barely a fringe candidate at 5 percent, while Mara won the ward with 38 percent, followed by Frumin at 27 percent and Silverman at 26 percent. Bonds, however, polled 79 percent in both Wards 7 and 8, both heavily African American, while none of the other candidates came close to double figures in either ward.\n\nBoth Silverman and Frumin targeted the \"white progressive\" vote, which they largely divided between them. Just before the election it was reported that Silverman tried to convince Frumin to drop out. If he had, Silverman might have won. Mara banked on there being enough fiscal conservatives and \"change\" advocates in DC to ride to victory, but the other candidates and their supporters wouldn't let voters forget his support for Mitt Romney and his no-new-taxes pledge. Mara also hurt himself in the largely liberal-to-progressive District by opposing both the right to sick leave and an increase in the local minimum wage.\n\nRedd ran on a progressive platform stressing DC statehood, tax and budget fairness, and policies to create jobs for DC residents. His poor showing is further evidence that the tiny Statehood Green Party needs to broaden its support if it hopes to be more than a footnote in a city dominated by Democrats. There is a model for success: The Statehood Party (prior to its merger with the Greens) held an at-large council seat for the 24 years ending in 1998, first under Julius Hobson and then Hilda Mason.\n\nApril's council election may be a warmup for next year's regularly scheduled election, in which Bonds' seat will be in play again. Silverman, with her generally progressive message, may have emerged as the leading candidate to unseat Bonds in a rematch. Mara, on the other hand, is now a three-time loser in Council races, and it appears he will have to content himself with trying to retain his seat on the Board of Education. One can hope that the candidates in next year's election work harder to bring the District together across racial lines, while advocating progressive policies that benefit all working-class District residents.\n\nAlso in this election, 83 percent of voters approved the referendum to free DC's budget from the federal appropriation process. The only surprise was that the percentage of \"yes\" votes was not higher. It remains to be seen whether this will survive scrutiny by Congress or whether it is even legal. But if nothing else, it serves as one more indication that DC residents are fed up with being wards of the federal government and desire more control over their local affairs.","order":0},{"title":"MAKING CHOICES","date":"2013-04-30","issue":"May 2013","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"*Contradictions* A decade of protests led by family members of the incarcerated and by human rights organizations ended in victory this year when Illinois Governor Pat Quinn announced the closure of the Tamms supermaximum prison – a prison which held individuals in complete isolation, often for years. Solitary confinement has been part of the US penal system since its origins in 1820s Pennsylvania, and has been condemned as cruel and damaging for nearly as long. Human beings are social beings — the routine denial of what is essential to our nature bespeaks an attitude that denies the humanity of those so treated. That same inhumanity continues to condemn others to conditions similar to those at Tamms, to imprison men and women at a rate of 716 per 100,000, rates unheard of in any other part of the globe (comparable figures for England and Wales is 149, Argentina 147, Ecuador 81, Sweden 70, as documented on the Internation Centre for Prison Studies website).\n\nYet mass incarceration has supporters: a multi-union council of prison guards, the AFSCME local that represented Tamms employees. For many of those workers, the heightened security of a prison that keeps inmates in isolation was something to defend. An argument retrospectively justified by the murder of a guard at a federal prison in Pennsylvania a month after the Tamms closure – even though it took place in a different institution with a different prison population. Fear is the reason for that connection; fear is what keeps workers on a job they believe is unsafe. Driving the action of prison unions can therefore be found another kind of fear, defined by the reality of job shortages. Even in better economic times, prisons have tended to be built in communities where jobs are at a premium. The desire to hold onto the work one has – even employment denying others' freedom – is all the greater in today's world of permanent insecurity.\n\nNotwithstanding socially progressive politics, potential job loss inhibited AFSCME's national leaders from challenging its local's opposition to the Tamms closure, a silence reported on in an article by James Ridgeway and Jean Casella (Mother Jones, February 22, 2013). The narrowness behind this is evident in other instances. AFL-CIO leadership has recognized the necessity of addressing climate change, but wouldn't take a position against the Keystone pipeline because building trades unions – whose members have been badly hit by our never-ending recession – support its construction. So too, opposition to rapacious military budgets and overseas wars rarely translates into support for closing an arms plant or army base, out of concern that those who do the work will suffer the consequence. It is a narrowness reinforced by the decades-long corporate assault on unions that has left workers, individually and collectively, with ever fewer rights and options. And as the range of the possible becomes smaller, accepting the unacceptable becomes easier.\n\nLabor's prioritizing immediate job preservation/creation over the long-term interests of its members and the society of which unionists form a part reflects the limitations of meaningful choice everywhere placed before working people. The problem is hardly labor's alone – it shows itself every time community groups or social movements compete for the same scarce resources. It is seen, too, in the ease with which society, in the main, has accepted inequality (and its concomitant ubiquitous surveillance) as a way of life. After all, neighborhood gentrification creates informal borders – visually evident in any bus ride from Anacostia to Friendship Heights – keeping the less affluent out of \"better neighborhoods.\" Yet for the Board of Trade, the Post or suburban newspapers what matters is the growth of affluence, not the fate of the displaced. Greater affluence in the District does enable the city to offer more to many of its residents; yet that sits uneasily with the hardship experienced in some wards, or in parts of Prince George's County. The city's relatively low unemployment rate and growing wealth can obscure the fact that two-thirds of DC public school children are classified as low-income, entitled to free or reduced price meals. A reality barely visible to those not impacted because it is joined with re-segregation: According to a report issued in 2010 by the Washington Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, more than two-thirds of D.C.'s black students attend schools that are between 90 and 100% black. It is the same racial and class divides that keep from sight the devastation wrought by our merciless criminal justice system – the world where most go to college and few to prison generally interacts only at the margins with the world in which youth are more likely to serve a stint behind bars than get a degree.\n\nFocus on improving a particular neighborhood or school, on holding onto a particular job or making it safer, can be part of a process to improve the quality of life for all. In fact, progress toward social justice will never be made until people join initiatives to improve their immediate circumstances with a commitment to broad egalitarian change. But in conditions of insecurity and social immobility, in conditions of weakened democratic and civil society institutions, particular needs are often posed against general social interests. A zero-sum game results, one in which working people always lose. Ultimately, finding a path toward resolution of the contradictions of labor's position is part of a process of challenging that powerlessness.\n\n*Conditions* Statistics sometimes speak loudly. When 2011 began, more than 7 million people, 1 in 34 adults, were under correctional system authority: 1,518,104 individuals in state or federal prison, 748,728 in jail, 840,676 on parole, 4,055,514 on probation (see the Sourcebook on Criminal Justice Statistics). Terrible numbers become worse when racial disparity is added to the mix. Numerous studies attest to greater likelihood of blacks and Latinos being arrested, and being sentenced to more time, for the same crimes as whites. Another statistic is indicative: 1 in 9 black men between the ages 18-30 are locked up. Women form a smaller part of the prison population, though their numbers rose dramatically over the past two decades. But the impact on them is much deeper, visible in every prison visiting room, as wives and mothers, girlfriends and sisters, struggle to keep families together against the pressure of family-unfriendly prison practices, against the economic pressure of helping loved ones behind bars, dealing with the pressure of being a single-parent household even when there are two parents in reality.\n\nOften a consequence of poverty, prison also reinforces that poverty. Few resources are provided when a door to freedom is opened. The lack of public services for those held by our criminal justice system means that too often those released from prison are homeless, without access to needed drug treatment or adequate health care. And these individuals are concentrated in areas with the highest unemployment and poverty rates. Nearly half of DC prisoners are from wards 7 and 8 – the wards where those segregated schools (and low math and reading proficiency rates) are also concentrated.\n\nJoblessness is a painful reality impacting an even wider number. Overall, about 22 million people remain unemployed or underemployed even after months of renewed economic growth. With three job seekers for every available job, pressure falls too on many who are working. Pressure to accept what would otherwise be rejected has become an all-too-normal part of life, for power is all on the employers' side. Power made greater by the aforementioned attacks on labor,launched by major corporations in the mid-1970's. The full fury of those attacks has moved from the private to the public sector – so teachers and postal employees are now facing denunciations and layoffs once reserved for auto and steel workers. Few institutions could face such pressure without retreat, and unions are no exception. Despite many false steps, labor has not been passive: The list of strikes, organizing, and other forms of resistance is long – a list marked by some victories, many defeats, by internal upheavals, a search for answers.\n\nAnswers that will only be adequate if they address the root causes of society's injustices. Government priorities, national economic policy and corporate investment strategy undermined job security and job rights, promoted the rise in racial inequality and massive increase of our prison population. Union progress, by contrast, depends on progress for all – beginning with those who have the least.\n\n*Commonalities* It would be impossible to recycle millions of people through prison without prior dehumanization of its victims. That dehumanization grows from stereotypes – rooted in slavery and Native American genocide — casting the unknown as sinister and amoral, controllable only through strict forms of repression. Challenging prevailing practices and outlooks, reaffirming common humanity, the civil rights/black freedom, anti-war, women's liberation and other social movements of the 1960s and 70s helped initiate measurable progress toward equality. Although much more was needed, a ladder had been created allowing for further progress. Progress is what those most opposed to steps toward substantive equality were determined to undo. Conservative reaction among those who feared the changes progressive movements had started to bring about gained momentum in the mid-70s, around the same time the corporate assault on labor was launched – no coincidence, for employer power relies on structural social and economic inequality. So too, right-wing power mobilized to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment in the mid 1980s and attack abortion rights in order to turn back the clock on movement toward gender equality. A blaming-the-victim mindset replaced demands for justice. Placing people outside the community by placing them beyond the pale of the moral creates a climate in which solitary confinement can be defended, even torture celebrated.\n\nLabor's struggle has been fought to force recognition that the hands that do the work also have minds, have feelings, belong to people deserving of dignity and respect. A century ago child labor, 10- or 12-hour work days, injury and death, were all common features of working life. Today, instead, dignity is denied through a denial of rights of assembly and speech, liberties absent at workplaces because the private rights of employers overcome constitutional rights of those employed. Destruction of jobs and communities in search of the god of profits has not only become acceptable, it is considered natural.\n\nAll this finds perfect expression in the Citizens United decision. The 14th Amendment, passed after the Civil War to guarantee citizenship rights to freed slaves, has been turned into a rule giving human rights to corporations that then deny labor rights for those who do the work that enables them to exist. The extent to which people tolerate the massive rise in the prison population, the extent to which people tolerate workers' loss of workplace rights and union representation, is the extent to which inequalities of wealth and power are normalized, the underlying destruction in the form of war abroad and climate change everywhere is accepted. Dehumanization, once begun, spreads to other people, just as violations of civil liberties and democratic rights for some undermines rights and liberties for all. Only when such negative commonalities are turned into positive solidarity can contradictions be overcome.\n\n*Way Forward* The Coalition of Black Trade Unionists and the Coalition of Union Women, each founded in the 1970s as autonomous organizations fighting for equality in society and inside organized labor, exemplify positive solidarity as they also organize for union rights. Today they are recognized constituency groups within the AFL-CIO, as are the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance and the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement and Pride at Work (organizing amongst lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers). Operating on different planes, previous labor peace and environmental justice bodies find expression in the Labor Sustainability Network and in US Labor Against War – unofficial groups that nonetheless work within and outside union circles, uniting concerns and issues that are often divided.\n\nOld borders between unions and non-union workers centers –such as the National Day Laborers Organizing Network, the National Domestic Workers Alliance – are being crossed as they can now directly affiliate with Central Labor Councils or the national AFL-CIO. The common front this potentially creates with the least protected workers is paralleled by an initiative to establish a coalition with civil rights, women's and other progressive organizations to defend and expand our nation's imperiled democracy.\n\nCommon threads can only emerge out of a multiplicity of concerns through on-going struggles; this AFL-CIO initiative may succeed where previous initiatives failed because unity is being built by building mutual commitments. We can see such a process in recent successful and unsuccessful campaigns in DC and Maryland: legalizing gay marriage, preventing fracking, abolishing the death penalty, raising minimum wage, granting paid sick leave, passing \"ban the box\" legislation. Not all supporters of one supported the others, but enough overlap exists to define the core of an alternative national politics challenging the divisions sown by capital, addressing the needs of the moment within the vision of a better world. A politics to expand democracy arises to allow today's powerless different possibilities and choices — breathable air and a job rather than one or the other; a secure life lived in hope and freedom for today's prisoner and prison guard alike.\n\n*Other sources not cited above:* Atul Gawande, \"Hellhole, *The New Yorker*, March 30, 2009 David Moberg, \"Labor's Turnaround,\" *In These Times*, March 3, 2013 Pew Center on the States, \"States of Recidivism: The Revolving Door of America's Prisons,\" April 2011 Rebecca Ruiz, ed., \"Mass Incarceration in America,\" *American Prospect* Jan./Feb. 2011 Sentencing Project: \"Facts about Prisons and Prisoners,\" (January 2013) and \"Trends in Corrections,\" (December 2012) Peter Scharff Smith, \"Solitary Confinement\" *Criminal Justice* \\#34, 2006","order":1},{"title":"May Day Today — And Yesterday","date":"2013-04-30","issue":"May 2013","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"**Happy International Workers' Day, the Real \"Labor Day\"**\n\nBy Bill Mosley\n\nMay 1 will mark the 127<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the first International Workers' Day, the date the campaign for the eight-hour workday was launched in the United States with massive rallies and a general strike. The infamous Haymarket Square massacre in Chicago, where a bomb killed seven police officers, occurred at one of these rallies. Eight workers were convicted, and some historians, including Howard Zinn, have concluded the bombing was the work of a provocateur who wanted to give police a pretext to arrest leaders of the protest. International Workers' Day is celebrated as the official day of labor in much of the world – but not in the United States where it began. In 1894 Congress, with the support of a few centrist labor organizations, established a \"Labor Day\" in September for the express purpose of avoiding association with the more radical and militant groups who championed May 1 as labor's holiday. So remember to raise a fist and a red banner this May Day. May Day Legacies\n\n**May Day Legacies**\n\n*By Kurt Stand*\n\n\"Nineteen years ago on the fourth of May ... I was one of those at a meeting at the Haymarket in this city to protest against eleven workingmen being shot to pieces at a factory in the southeastern part of this city because they had dared to strike for the eight-hour movement that was to be inaugurated in America in 1886. The Haymarket meeting was called primarily to protest against the murder of comrades at the McCormick factory. When that meeting was nearing its close someone threw a bomb. No one knows to this day who threw it. ... And yet in the soil of Illinois, ... the soil in which the great, magnificent Lincoln was buried, in the State that was supposed to be the most liberal in the union, five men sleep the last sleep in Waldheim \\[cemetery\\] under a monument that has been raised there because they dared to raise their voices for humanity. I say to any of you ... go out there and draw some inspiration around the graves of the first martyrs who fell in the great industrial struggle for liberty on American soil.\"\n\nLucy Parsons, probably born a slave, of black, Mexican and Native American ancestry, made those remarks in 1905 at the IWW's founding convention. Albert Parsons, her husband, a Confederate soldier in the civil war, was – along with August Spies, Adolph Fischer, Georg Engel, Louis Ling – one of the five anarchist and socialist labor leaders sentenced to death for a bombing they did not commit. Rooted in German, Czech and other working-class immigrant communities, they sought to both build the 8-hour day movement and spread the revolutionary unionism that had begun to take root in Chicago. It was the linkage between demands for immediate betterment of the conditions of life with demands for a fundamental change in the structures and conditions of society that made the dispute between reaction and labor radicalism especially fierce. Speaking at a meeting in London in 1888 honoring the Haymarket martyrs – on a platform with the socialist William Morris and the anarchist Peter Kropotkin — Parsons defined goals she would fight for, organize for, her entire life:\n\n\"What is the Revolution? Why, it is the breath of life, that stupendous struggle for relief. I hear that voice in the cold dank mines of Siberia; I hear it in the sunny clime of Italy; I hear it across the mighty Atlantic's wave; I hear it in the prison of Joliet in the state of Illinois; — wherever there is a man or woman beneath the sun who wants better homes, better clothes, better food.\" Back in Chicago, unable to speak in public without being arrested, she told an interviewer her belief that \" ... the world and its wealth and its treasures and its happiness should, like the air and the sunshine, belong to all mankind, and not to a few.\"\n\nPledging to continue the fight for the 8-hour day, inspired by the national strike around that demand in the US, and honoring the Haymarket martyrs, the Socialist International meeting in Paris in 1890 called upon workers to make May first a holiday and a day of struggle in all parts of the globe. In following years, the focus of the holiday deepened and broadened in its meaning. Rosa Luxemburg, then participating in the formation of Poland's first socialist organizations, wrote in 1894:\n\n\"The first of May demanded the introduction of the eight-hour day. But even after this goal was reached, May Day was not given up. As long as the struggle of the workers against the bourgeoisie and the ruling class continues, as long as all demands are not met, May Day will be the yearly expression of these demands. And when better days dawn, when the working class of the world has won its deliverance – then too humanity will probably celebrate May Day in honor of the bitter struggles and many sufferings of the past.\"\n\nThe 8-hour movement, as Luxemburg noted, was widely successful in North America and Europe; but those deeper injustices and hopes identified by her, by Parsons, by the movements and organizations of which they were a part, remained. On May Day 1916, Karl Liebknecht — the first member of the German parliament to vote against war credits in World War 1, drafted into the army because his parliamentary immunity protected him from arrest — spoke before a mass anti-war demonstration in front of the Kaiser's palace, telling the crowd,\n\n\"Our enemies are not the English, French or Russian workers, but the great landed proprieters, the German capitalists, and their executive committee, the government.\"\n\nStrikes and other mass protest actions broke out in Germany for the first time since war was declared, acts of insubordination which the government would not tolerate – throwing away the pretense of respecting the rights of parliament, Liebknecht was arrested. In his statement to the court Liebknecht explained his actions thusly:\n\n\"Since 1889 the First of May has been dedicated both to education in and demonstration for the principles of socialism and against all exploitation, oppression and violation of human rights. It has proclaimed the solidarity of workers of all countries, a solidarity which is not negated but is strengthened by war. May Day stands against fratricidal slaughter among workers, against war, and for peace. \"\n\nLiebknecht remained in prison until liberated by Germany's November 1918 revolution, as was Luxemburg who had been arrested previously. Both led efforts to realize the hopes of that revolution – and each was murdered in 1919 by forerunners of the Nazis, anticipating the arrests, executions that would intensify all over Germany in 1933.\n\nMay Day marches in the US also focused on opposition to militarism. Following Cleveland's 1917 May Day march, Ohio's Socialist Party (and future Communist) leaders Charles Ruthenberg, Kate Richard O'Hare, and Alfred Wagenknecht were arrested for opposing a war the US had just entered. It was in solidarity with them and out of determination to make his own voice heard that Eugene Debs gave the public speech in nearby Canton, denouncing World War I, knowing full well he would be paid by a lengthy prison sentence. Jailings, lynchings, beatings, deportations, seizure of publications, refusal to seat elected officials, would continue throughout the country for several years more. The million votes Debs received in 1920 while running for president from his prison cell in Leavenworth, Kansas testified to the resistance against that repression.\n\nAll this speaks to events and times long distant, yet not so long ago or distant as to be without relevance. How relevant? Perhaps the most massive march – and strike – in recent years took place in the immigrant rights protest in 2006. A speech Debs gave in 1910 would have fit in perfectly then (and still this year), as he said that the foreign born,\n\n\" ... have just as good a right to enter here as \\[those\\] who now seek to exclude them. The only difference is that the latter had the advantage of a little education and had not been so cruelly ground and oppressed, but in point of principle there is no difference, the motive of all being precisely the same, and if \\[we\\] should discriminate at all it should be in favor of the \\[people\\] who have borne the heaviest burdens and are most nearly crushed upon earth. ... If Socialism ... does not stand staunchly, unflinchingly, and uncompromisingly for the working class and for the exploited and oppressed masses of all lands, then it stands for none ...\"\n\nDebs' statement to the court prior to his sentencing in 1918 would have similarly fit in May Day 2011's Occupy actions:\n\n\"... five percent of the people ... constitute that element that absolutely rule our country. They privately own all our public necessities. They wear no crowns ; they wield no scepters, they sit upon no thrones; and yet they are our economic masters and our political rulers. They control this government and all of its institutions. They control the courts. The five percent ... control all of the sources of wealth, all of the nation's industries, all the means of our common life ... And so long as this is true, we can make no just claim to being a democratic government – a self-governing people.\"\n\nThe fact that the struggle for simple justice for immigrants remains a struggle still to be won, the fact that Occupy activists talked of 1% rather than 5% reflect the sad reality of too little progress having been made in the intervening years. But that reflects too the ebb and flow of capitalist society, which tends always to undo the positive change social movements have brought about. Rosa Luxemburg, writing in Germany in 1913 on the history of May Day, could have been writing with thought in mind of the illusions so many had prior to our banking collapse in 2007:\n\n\"\\[In 1890 when international May Day began\\] the capitalist economy had just begun a phase of splendid growth which would last nearly a decade. At the same time, after twenty years of unbroken peace, the world breathed a sigh of relief, remembering the period of war in which the modern European state system had received its bloody baptism. The path seemed free for a peaceful cultural development; illusions, hopes of a reasonably pacific discussion between labor and capital grew abundantly like green corn in the ranks of socialism. ... Crises, wars, and revolution were supposed to have been things of the past, the baby shoes of modern society; ... democracy in the state and democracy in the factory were supposed to open the doors of a new, better order.\n\n\"The course of events has submitted all of these illusions to a fearful test. ... In the following decade, the ten-year period of economic prosperity was paid for by two violent world crises. After two decades of world peace, in the last decade of the past century followed six bloody wars, and in the first decade of the new century four bloody revolutions. Instead of social reforms – conspiracy laws, penal laws, and penal praxis; instead of industrial democracy—the powerful concentration of capital in cartels and business associations, and the international practice of gigantic lock-outs. And instead of the new growth of democracy in the state – a miserable breakdown of the last remnants of bourgeois liberalism and bourgeois democracy.\"\n\nA passage that was not a counsel of despair; rather Luxemburg was reaffirming the need to think historically in order to better understand current challenges. Lucy Parsons' life speaks to the possibility of making such connections. She never stopped agitating or organizing, consistently campaigning for the rights of women, the \"slave of slaves\" as she put it, and for the full participation of women in the labor and left movements of her day. Always poor herself, Parson always took part in actions of the poorest and most disenfranchised when demanding jobs, decent housing, decent pay. And, true to the heritage of Haymarket, she stood with those victimized by repressive actions of police and courts.\n\nParsons joined the campaigns to free Sacco and Vanzetti (Italian-American anarchists executed in Massachussets in 1927), Tom Mooney (socialist labor activist, imprisoned for 22-years after being framed for a bombing in 1916), Angelo Herndon (a black coal miner and young communist arrested on a charge of insurrection for leading an unemployed march in Atlanta in 1932), the Scottsboro boys (black youth falsely charged with raping two white women in Alabama in 1931). Continuities can be found between those struggles and today's struggles to stop violence against women, or to end wage theft; in the solidarity campaigns for Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu-Jamal; of the years the \"Central Park 5\" spent in prison before finally being released.\n\nIn 1941, shortly before her death, a 91-year-old Parsons was honored at her last May Day, carried in a float by members of the United Auto Workers local representing the newly organized workers at International Harvester – workers employed at the McCormick factory of old. Triumph after defeat is also part of May Day's legacy, child of the optimism in Parson's IWW speech:\n\n\" ... we are here as one brotherhood and one sisterhood, as one humanity with a responsibility to the down-trodden and the oppressed of all humanity, it matters not under what flag or in what country they happened to be born. Let us have that idea of Thomas Paine, that 'The world is my country, and mankind are my countrymen.'\"\n\nAnd in the words with which she closes:\n\n\"I hope even now to live to see the day when the first dawn of the new era of labor will have risen, when capitalism will be a thing of the past, and the new industrial republic, the commonwealth of labor, shall be in operation.\"\n\n[*Socialism from the ground up: a review*](http://dsadc.org/socialism-from-the-ground-up-a-review/)\n\nTuesday, April 30th, 2013\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;* May 2013**\n\n*By Woody Woodruff*\n\nGar Alperovitz, *What Then Must We Do?: Straight Talk About the Next American Revolution* (Chelsea Green Publishing, White River Junction, Vt., 2013)\n\nGar Alperovitz's newest book, *What Then Must We Do?: Straight Talk About the Next American Revolution*, has many pleasures for socialist readers. The book is written in a conversational, almost bar-confab tone that only occasionally lapses into the jargon of political economy. This appears a deliberate strategy to gain wide access for its arguments, though it sometimes makes them seem a little thin and disorganized. But his argument has some bearing on our search for a socialist \"elevator speech\" (probably the longer one, to the 30<sup>th</sup> floor or so).\n\nThe organization of the book is almost deliberately elusive, dwelling first on the current political gridlock and its roots in the erosion of popular power to counter corporate hegemony. The book's arc then dances through instance after well-documented instance of local, specific democratization and institution of worker management that push back against corporate dominance, familiar (Mondragon) and unfamiliar (the State Bank of North Dakota). How to mobilize that scattered set of effects for radical change is the final stage, though it seems incomplete. The title, despite its resonances, is from Tolstoy, not a paraphrase of Lein's \"What is to be done?\" <span id=\"_msoanchor_1\" class=\"anchor\"></span>\n\nThe point (and sometimes the reader has to dredge for it): The US national government's gridlock is to some extent a function of the nation's size and scope. To keep working people in charge of their own interests, the scale has to be reduced. Necessity and choice have generated many successful examples of democratization at scale. Alperovitz has been working this regionalist, communitarian vein for many years. I was a participant in one of many seminars he ran at the Institute for Policy Studies in the last decades of the last century, and the theme had well emerged even then.\n\nAlperovitz's grounds for this approach include not only manageable scale, but communication: \"Scale also significantly determines who has privileged access to the nation's news media and who can largely shape its political discourse,\" he notes on page 152 of the advantage wealth confers given the high cost of major media in gigantic national markets .\n\nOne advantage for radical, transformative movement work is the \"incentive to take independent action\" that grows into a wider public when national governments' provision of services falters and becomes obviously inequitable. This leads to a motivator for change that is easily recognizable – the inevitable pain suffered by large majorities as wealth and power are increasingly concentrated and the economy stagnates. His strategy assumes things will get worse.\n\nThe book's overall argument develops with many an oblique trail and a frustrating incidence of \"more about this later.\" Alperovitz begins with the breakdown of old political dynamics: \"the system (the way underlying institutional power is currently arranged) seems now to be producing outcomes... that do not much respond to the old theory of politics.\" Thus, change-making strategy \"requires getting serious about large-order processes, not simply elections and policies.\"\n\nDetails unfold into a pattern of relentless sealing-up of the avenues of access and influence that ordinary folks and organizations used to have available. The sealing-up is the work of the institutions for whom its advantageous to do so – the right, corporate money and increasingly co-opted officials, elected and otherwise. As Jeff Faux said in [*a recent account*](http://dsadc.org/faux-predicts-further-erosion-of-workers-rights/), Washington is not at all dysfunctional from the point of view of those who have achieved power – it works quite well for them.<span id=\"_msoanchor_3\" class=\"anchor\"></span>\n\nWhat's a little different about Alperovitz's narrative is that he suggests that the level of corporate-rightist influence we see today is only a matter of degree – that the typical \"system\" in the US was quite similarly dominated by wealth and power, interrupted only by the Great Depression and World War 2 and its immediate aftermath. He cites progressive historians Nick Salvatore and Jefferson Cowie as noting \"the progressive gains of the middle third of the twentieth century \\[were\\] largely an aberration.\"\n\nThe inequalities of power, then, are \"structural and systemic\" and not an artifact of our recent difficult decades marked by Reagan and Clinton, the Bushes and Obama.\n\nA theory of \"countervailing power\" (quoting J.K. Galbraith) that balanced corporate hegemony in charge and popular response to keep it in check therefore applies just to that anomalous period of the Depression and WW2. From the '70s the decline of union strength, influence and membership has been the principal reason for the return to that inequitable *status quo* *ante*. Alperovitz's imperative, nearly 50 pages into the book: \"The current corporate-dominated hegemonic ideology that *prevents us from acting together in new ways*, quite simply, needs to be replaced\" (my italics).\n\nWhat can bring change? \"Evolutionary reconstruction,\" (p. 35) as he terms it, is a slow-building displacement of the failing national government with new institutions. The narrative comprises a number of existing examples starting with the apparently failed attempt at worker ownership of Youngstown Sheet and Tube in the late '70s-early '80s. Alperovitz points out, perhaps overhopefully, that although that pioneering effort finally withered because the Carter administration lost interest in supporting it, Ohio now \"many worker-owned businesses,\" has an innovative worker-ownership think tank at Kent State and \"the support system for building them \\[worker-owned enterprises\\] is one of the best in the nation.\" (pp. 30-31)\n\nThe United Steel Workers, which initially opposed the worker-ownership project at Youngstown Sheet and Tube, has now come around, Alperovitz says, and with other unions is supporting worker-owned projects in Ohio and around the country.\n\nAlperovitz highlights other existing avenues to worker control, such as \"B corporations\" that are legally released from fiduciary requirements to pursue public ends. A pro-public goods decision by leaders of a B corporation cannot be constrained by stockholders or anyone else demanding that the company maximize profits under all circumstances.\n\nAnd he has good words for ESOPs – Employee Stock Ownership Plans – designed by former Sen. Russell Long of Louisiana to give employees a financial stake in businesses large and small. Alperovitz acknowledges that \"most ESOPs have not been set up to encourage democratic control\" (p. 42) and that there are significant tax incentives for capital and ownership built in. He mentions \"bad apples\" that have made progressives and unions suspicious of ESOPs as deliberate, shortf-circuiting bars to real radicalization but doesn't name the most egregious, like Home Depot or the Tribune Co., the media giant purchased for a song by real estate magnate Sam Zell. By loading most of the debt into an ESOP – onto the employees, in other words – Zell purchased the flagging enterprise for very little of his own money and set a vivid example of the law's vulnerability to exploitation. Efforts in Congress to democratize ESOPs by providing incentives for allowing employees to vote their stock (not a requirement of the original law) are ongoing and have a strange-bedfellow collection of conservative and progressive sponsors.\n\nESOPs and B-corps are just two of the many activities going on right now around the US – many of them framed like or inspired by the Mondragon cooperative in Spain – that Alperovitz touts as making up an expanding \"checkerboard.\" Those democratized patches grow together, in his narrative of a future, to form the evolutionary reconstruction of practices and institutions in the US. Many of them have the blessing, if not the wholehearted support, of municipal and state government entities.\n\nAlperovitz appears to recognize the reader's problem here. Every one of these activities, positive as it is, appears to be happening independently. There is no coherent strategy. What will bind them together?\n\n\"Socialism\" gets its first serious mention (in a chapter heading) on page 58. Though it's often what he terms \"Socialism, American style\" or perhaps Socialism Lite, Alperovitz checks off the 2,000-plus publicly owned electrical utilities in the US, unburdened by the need to satisfy shareholders with dividends and therefore able to deliver better energy pricing – and, sometimes, broadband as well. States, cities and counties engage in public management of development, including hotel and resort ownership, and energy recovery from landfills. Public management of pension plans (prefigured in Rifkin and Barber's *The North Will Rise Again* in 1977) is widespread. Publicly funded economic development incubators are rife. One state – North Dakota – even has its own state bank (a bill to study starting such a bank in Maryland had a short half-life in this year's legislative session).\n\nBut real institutional change is marginal, even though the buzz of democratic solidarity often accompanies these enterprises.\n\nA \"strategic plan\" that will enhance democratization as part of the effort would include \"a coherent economic way forward\" that builds the local and regional tax base to lower taxpayer pressure and allows for alliances based on worker self-management, control and eventually ownership – alliances with a political dimension. Clearly – and, as mentioned above, Alperovitz has been working this vein for years – these effects are most easily brought off at the local and regional levels, where scale allows for visibility, effective communication and transparency plus easy identification of oligarchs and democrats in the public eye. Alperovitz concedes that much of the struggle ahead will be complicated by the need to reduce the pain, poverty and joblessness that are inevitably the product of corporate hegemony and its consequent stagnation, current and future.\n\nAt the national level, the slower evolutionary reconstruction might be hastened or abetted by crises at the national level, Alperovitz argues Two \"hot spots\" where \"crisis transformations\" might arise are the financial sector and health care. Both are highly visible as causes of accumulating pain, and their benefits to the public are burdened by their obligatory benefits to the rulers of private capital. The Affordable Care Act's political price for passage, Alperovitz notes, was to pay hush money to the insurance and pharmaceutical industries – to leave them \"in the game\" for their agreement not to oppose universal health care. Both health care and the Wall Street casino, however, might be ripe for \"crisis transformation\" because of their high public visibility and low popularity – spurring moves in the direction of regulated banking under the shadow of nationalization, and toward an approximation of single-payer health care.\n\nBut all these events, actual and possible, appear to be random. Alperovitz argues they have enough similarities, within the overall hegemonic framework, to \"become strategic political ideas rather than random developments and events.\" What will bring that step? Alperovitz argues that the coming \"new normal\" of permanent stagnation brought on\nby extreme economic inequality will provide the public pain to push\npolitical radicalization – at least to the point that a coherent strategic plan for change coupled with the existing examples of democratized workplace success will encounter a more receptive public. But \"how far such processes might develop as the pain deepens is clearly an open question.\"\n\nMany potential variables in the future of change provide different future paths, good and bad – demographic change that undercuts the rightist stranglehold on Congress; mass response to the growing evidence of climate change; a recovery of labor power through some of the very regional checkerboard strategies the book illuminates – even sporadic violent resistance bringing on [*\"Friendly Fascism\"*](http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Fascism/Friendly_Fascism_BGross.html) (Bertram Gross's projection of the tendencies of Reaganism) and paradoxically sharpening that resistance. Alperovitz argues that no path should be discarded because all potentially lead out of the swamp of the \"new normal\" of stagnation and oligarchy that will likely culminate in a \"legitimation crisis.\"\n\n(N.B.: The legitimation crisis is already very nearly here, we can surmise from the recent work of two economist-pollsters who found that although US respondents were quite favorable toward redistributing income and wealth in the current economic environment, they were unwilling to trust the US government to accomplish it. [*http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/our-feelings-about-inequality-its-complicated/*](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/our-feelings-about-inequality-its-complicated/) )\n\nUnder such conditions, Alperovitz argues, a communitarian regionalist strategy can displace, or replace, existing national institutions with rightly-scaled democratic local institutions. \"*The institutional requirements of community pose fundamental issues that neither corporate capitalism nor state socialism ever took seriously*,\" he summarizes (his italics).\n\nRegional democratization efforts, he proposes, may allow a bottom-up democracy (Benjamin Barber's \"strong democracy,\" engaged and participatory) to replace \"checkerboard\" style the top-down variety that's endemic to national government under corporate hegemony. This may be like, or similar to, what the reviewer has learned (all too recently) to call autonomism. Alperovitz refers frequently to the impetus that fueled the Occupy movement as the horizontal radicalism he seems to mean.\n\nComments on the first draft of this review pointed out omissions on Alperovitz's part that this writer overlooked, which doesn't reflect well on the book or the reviewer. Neither the specific needs and remedies for women and minorities, nor a consideration of the effects of globalization, make a significant appearance in this book. I surmise that Alperovitz sees the coming economic pain as so universally applied as to blur those differences among the oppressed. And his analysis focuses principally on the opportunities for transformation that are implicit in the unwieldy size of the US.\n\nThough he has not developed the notion much, Alperovitz also argues in his closing that a communitarian regionalist polity can manage a sustainable economy not chained to a constant growth rate. More concrete work on these subjects by Lester Brown (on the environmental side) and economist Herman Daly would back him up, but this book is thin on that near-throwaway premise. (Daly, however, provides an enthusiastic blurb for the book).\n\nSocialists will find this book satisfying but finally not very tightly fashioned at the crucial points – who and how will develop the strategy that can replace existing institutions with bottom-up democratic institutions; who will create the regional patterns; how will public provision and commodity equity be ensured? A two-page quickie on \"planning\" in the book's Afterword amounts mostly to a call for research (on trade, he references Schweickart's *After Capitalism* Chapter 3.6). Socialists will have to bring socialism as such to this nascent social-democratic flux.\n\nStill, Alparovitz offers one clear vision: The national government in a sense is making itself irrelevant, and regional, communitarian solutions will become a clearly preferable alternative, appealing to a much wider, previously non-socialist public. In fact, it seems to this reader, the development of these regional solutions, deeply democratized and linked to work and consumption, will be more likely to create a socialist *society* – that is, a public consensus on the scope of public goods and on the need to control their management democratically. Socialist governance encompassing workers and consumers alike could emerge organically from such a set of practices.\n\nThis might reduce the need for direct struggle against the corporate hegemonists; radicals can sort of slide past that battle into regional transformation. However, as Bill Fletcher Jr. says in [*a review in *Jacobin**](http://jacobinmag.com/2013/04/visions-of-a-new-world/) , there's no guarantee that the ruling class will allow its power to slip away without a response.\n\nAlperovitz's meticulous itemization of locations where workplace democracy and public management are already taking place is a heartening picture and shows that organizers and radicals do not have to depend on their utopian imaginations to talk of, or participate in, a better tomorrow. And if we socialists have anything to sell, it must be grounded on concrete examples of how it works. Many of the materials are available in this book; the strategic plan appears still to be fashioned.\n\n*A tidy summary by Alperovitz of some of this book's premises and findings is at* [*http://truth-out.org/author/itemlist/user/46199*](http://truth-out.org/author/itemlist/user/46199)\n\nThe following addition to this post was made on May 29, 2013:\n\nAn excellent review in *Dissent* of this book plus another by Alperovitz and David Schweickart's *After Capitalism* is at [*http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online\\_articles/a-realistic-radicalism*](http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/a-realistic-radicalism)","order":2},{"title":"SOCIALIST TAKES AND TAKEAWAYS","date":"2013-04-30","issue":"May 2013","author":"","body":"First, a job opportunity from Maria Svart, DSA's national director:\n\n**DSA is hiring a Young Democratic Socialists student organizer**\n\n***Deadline to apply May 3rd***\n\nYDS is an organization of campus-based democratic socialists who are members of DSA.

Moss gets inside the deliberations of giant processed food corporations and their use of sophisticated scientific and marketing techniques to hook consumers on unhealthy food – and how they use their money and clout to prevent the government from requiring them to reduce the amounts of salt, sugar, fats and other unhealthy ingredients in their products.

And while the film practically beatifies Branch Rickey, the Brooklyn Dodger executive who signed Robinson, it also hints that racial justice may not have been his only motive – he wanted to snatch the best Negro League players before any other team could, thereby quickly building a dynasty. \"All money's green,\" Rickey (played by Harrison Ford, no less) says.

The second is: what unique contribution can socialists make – if any – toward fixing what's wrong?\n\nWhen around 17 million Americans attended the first Earth Day events some 43 years ago, an easy answer to both questions was: \"not much.\"\n\nWith some exceptions, socialists and others on the U.S. left had concerned themselves throughout the 1960s with other urgent issues – notably including the antiwar movement, the struggle for civil rights and Black liberation at home, urban poverty, and late in the decade, the Second Wave feminist struggle and the post-Stonewall Riots struggle for gay liberation.\n\nThe 1970s incubated radical and indeed \"revolutionary\" movements for change, but most leftists involved gave environmental issues little heed, and some in fact denounced pollution concerns as \"petit bourgeois\" compared to, say, the urgency of halting the Vietnam War or combating police brutality towards Black youth in the cities.\n\nAlso with a few exceptions, most leaders of the US environmental movement in 1970 were lukewarm or antagonistic to socialism. In fact some green critics charged – with some justification — that the style of \"socialism\" embodied by the old Soviet bloc was a worse environmental nightmare than western capitalism.\n\nSocialism in western Social Democratic guise, the critics further noted, seemed addicted to what leading green thinkers considered ecologically ruinous forms of economic growth. And many critics argued that socialism's environmental flaws were hardly accidental, but instead rooted in Marx's radically mistaken loyalty to a \"labor standard of value\" — although both the critics of the \"labor theory\" and some of its self-styled Marxist defenders were often rather vague on what exactly it meant.\n\nFor these and other reasons, including disputes over the legacy of population theorist Thomas Malthus and the mainstream environmental lobby's understandable search for political respectability in Washington , open cooperation between American environmentalists and American socialists was rare in 1970. It continues to be extremely rare today, although eco-anarchist and eco-feminist ideas seem to have flourished in the US , while new movements combining green and socialist perspectives have emerged in other societies.\n\nDespite this problematic history, however a variety of socialists have struggled for the past generation to address the global environmental challenge, both politically and theoretically. And on the occasion of Earth Day 2013, democratic socialists who haven't followed their debates too closely may want to familiarize ourselves with an increasingly impressive green socialist literature.\n\nOne theoretically interesting, but sometimes frustrating, place to start our reading is a recent book from Monthly Review Press, *The Ecological Rift: Capitalism's War on the Earth.* Coauthored by John Bellamy Foster, current editor of *Monthly Review* magazine, and two fellow environmental sociologists, Brett Clark and Richard York, *Ecological Rift* is arguably a bit too ambitious in its scope.\n\nAddressing climate activists as well as socialists, taking sides in complex academic debates within both environmental sociology and biological ecology, and striving to integrate Marx's intellectual legacy with recent environmental reports by global scientific bodies, this book sprawls at times. Several of its chapters (closely based on previously published journal articles) also are somewhat repetitive. It's not a book that most people will read in one sitting, or in two.\n\nA major strength of *Ecological Rift*, however, is that it rescues Marx's reputation from misunderstandings about the labor theory of value and in fact demonstrates how Marx's acceptance of Adam Smith's earlier distinction between the \"exchange values\" – monetary values – of commodities and their physical \"use values\" helps to explain why capitalist societies are chronically driven to plunder the planet, for nothing more solid than mere money.\n\nThe authors also employ Marxist economics to explain how the compulsion to \"accumulate\" capital, by repeatedly investing money to generate profits, then reinvesting the proceeds in the search for even higher profits, drives capitalist economic systems to expand beyond all conceivable social and natural boundaries – towards long term ecological ruin.\n\nA third major environmental flaw in capitalism, as the book's title suggests, is the geographical \"rift\" it has historically made in natural ecological processes, notably the circulation of nutrients between human civilization and the soil.\n\nAs famed German chemist Justus von Liebig observed in the 1850s and as Marx noted afterwards in *Capital,* early industrial capitalism by uprooting rural peasants and converting them into a landless \"proletariat\" in large industrial cities, where they depended on food imported from the countryside, broke the tradition pattern of nutrients being returned to their places of origin through human excretion.\n\nCapitalist agriculture instead \"robbed the soil\" by extracting minerals like nitrogen, phosphorous and calcium from place A and transporting them long distances to city B, von Liebig and Marx note. There they eventually reentered the environment in the form of water pollution – thus perpetuating environmental destruction at both ends of the food chain.\n\nThe development of a huge artificial fertilizer industry since Marx's day means today agribusiness doesn't destroy soil productivity nearly as fast as it once did, but severe pollution of lakes, rivers and even \"dead spots\" in the ocean from excessive fertilizer runoff has become a global problem, if not a crisis. And this \"ecological rift\" created by agribusiness seems likely to worsen as global capitalism ships foodstuffs increasingly long distances from the growers to the ultimate consumers.\n\nUnfortunately the global \"rift\" in nutrient recycling and the crisis in global emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases represent just two out of 11 different ways in which today's civilization is pressing dangerously past key environmental boundaries, the authors report. The acidification of the oceans from excessive CO2 levels in the air, increasing extinction rates leading to global losses in biodiversity, excessive levels of freshwater use and the conversion of natural landscapes to other uses are some of the other effects of our basically capitalist global economy and its relentless expansionary drives.\n\nYet many existing and proposed environmental reforms aimed at curbing the global crisis are almost certain, because of the laws of capitalist growth and accumulation, to make it worse, according to The *Ecological Rift.*\n\nThe authors at the end of this long book then go on to outline the kind of eco-socialist revolution that they believe is ultimately necessary to stop the damage, through the \"associated producers\" (to quote Marx's words in *Capital* Vol. 3) governing \"the human metabolism with nature in a rational way, bringing it under their collective control ... accomplishing it with the least expenditure of energy and in conditions most worthy and appropriate for their human nature.\"\n\nThe strategy by which Foster, Clark and York believe an \"ecological proletariat\" can accomplish this revolutionary goal is too complex (and in places fragmentary) to summarize easily here and is likely to strike at least some DSA members as unsatisfactory. The book suggests, for example, that Asian peasants with Maoist politics and South American followers of Hugo Chavez, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador are likely to be more pivotal to eco-socialist transformation than European-style social democrats.\n\nWhether or not socialist history – including the checkered history of Leninism – truly justifies this focus on more Third World revolt is debatable. In any event, it's to be hoped that democratic socialists will find some ways to make a global eco-transformation attractive to unionized US workers as well, even including some older white men, or the book's vision of eco-socialist revolution could be a little too long time in arriving to avert global disasters.\n\nYet regardless of whether all socialists agree with each detail in *Ecological Rift*, the book represents a bold advance in progressive attempts to grapple with the theoretical causes as well as practical consequences of global environmental crisis. It will be good if DSA members can read it and learn from it in that light.\n\n*This review essay also appears in the national DSA* [**environmental blog**](http://www.dsausa.org/what_would_an_eco_socialist)","order":4},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—May 2013 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"May 2013","order":-1,"date":"2013-05-02","body":"May Day 2013\n\nWelcome to the May 2013 issue of *The Washington Socialist*.

The film has been overshadowed by its coverage of waterboarding\nby which the CIA may have obtained intelligence about his location.\nEven the CIA has objected to the waterboarding scene. However, the real focus of the film is the major role that women are playing in intelligence gathering and operations, and for that, it is commendable. In U.S. military and paramilitary forces woman are making major strides and are only treated differently in the draft. Considering that most jobs a hundred years ago were defined by gender, we are now nearing the end of legal job segregation by gender.\n\nThe film is based on the real-life struggle of a female CIA intelligence agent facing bureaucratic, political, terror, and intelligence obstacles in the pursuit of Osama. The protagonist of *Zero Dark Thirty* was remarkable in her prolonged determination to find Osama bin Laden while others found bureaucratic or political concerns limiting their involvement in the search. The film depicts intelligence operations as an almost industrial process. When the decade-long work of finding the target has been done, then the national heroes of Seal Team Six appear. It appears killing Osama bin Laden was easier then finding him.\n\nAnother observation about the film would be that the search for bin Laden would not have been possible without the extensive involvement of people of color in the CIA and recruited to CIA operations. This is especially true of Pakistan where some locals form armed patrols to keep Europeans out of their communities. These realities were shown but not emphasized. Exploring these diversities would make for a different film, but one that is sorely need in the US as we face globalization.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if women have an impact on how and what intelligence is achieved. Will they make a better distinction between what can be done and what should be done than their male counterparts? In 1953 the British MI-6 and the American CIA overturned the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister to replace him with the dictatorship of the Shah in order to get more profitable control of Iran's oil. This was a doable CIA project, but were private oil profits a worthy goal? Was it worth installing a dictator whose overthrow is still screwing up the Mideast? An important question is why have we allowed US foreign policy to be run for private profit instead of expanding democracy and development?\n\nThe example of British banking suggests that the involvement of women can lead to wiser decisions. A UK study of UK banks showed that the more women there were in a bank's leadership the less risky behavior and losses happened in the Great Recession. This might get us better long-term thinking, but we will also need elected officials more focused on peaceful and sustainable world development than on private profit.\n\n*\\`**NO*** **\\* in Spanish with English subtitles \\* (R, 110 min.)**\n\nIn 1988 Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet calls a plebiscite to determine if the general would rule for another eight years. Opposition leaders persuade a young skate-boarding advertising developer (fictional) to spearhead the campaign to vote NO. The film *NO* is inspired by the history of this plebiscite.\n\nThere are many twists and turns in this story. When a campaign of \"Chile, happiness is coming – vote NO\" is developed, many who have lost friends, family, and comrades to the brutal Pinochet regime leave the campaign, seeing it as disrespectful if not traitorous for not mentioning those lost. Many believe the poll is rigged — including the campaign developer's wife, who was just recently released from prison for her political activism.\n\nThe NO vote wins partly because after 15 years of dictatorship, many Chileans yearn for the happiness of a less- controlled society. Not really shown are the indigenous workers, the strong unions, strong political parties, student organizations, human rights groups, and a grass roots effort pushing voter registration to 92% of potential voters. Another factor was that many of the generals went along with the recommendations of their foreign backers and accepted the result of the plebiscite. In the film the long diverse lines at the polls hint at the nature of Chilean society, but the story is focused on just the urban and educated of Chile. Note: Ad agencies do not get 92% of the voters registered; unions and parties do.\n\nRemembering that the film is an art form to convey some sentiment of the time is necessary to understand its limitations. If you need a PR primer on \"how to overthrow dictators,\" this is not the movie.\n\nHowever, the film brings forth the challenge of advertising, polls, or any modern communication used to sway public opinion. Plato was skeptical of democracy, reasonably so, because he sensed that \"the many\" are easily misled. If the US election of 2012 was an example, the dearth of real policy discussion and the excess of targeted posturing could lead one to think that Plato was right. Political operatives toward the end of the 2012 campaign advised against any use of statistics because both sides had completely discredited themselves with regard to numbers.\n\nThe manipulative use of psychology, sociology, statistics, and culture in advertising suggest that the knowledge of one's self and one's society is not easily achieved, but is necessary to understand the present and to achieve social change. Until that knowledge spreads more throughout the society, we are likely to see more manipulation and less direct and straightforward communication. However this is a good movie to see and to stimulate discussion of the use of media in campaigns.\n\n[*Deconstructing Obama's Climate Message From a Green (and Socialist) Perspective*](http://dsadc.org/deconstructing-obamas-climate-message-from-a-green-and-socialist-perspective/)\n\nFriday, March 1st, 2013\n\n***The Washington Socialist*** &lt;&gt; **March 2013**\n*By Andy Feeney*\n\nFor democratic socialists who care about the environment – and for countless American environmentalists who probably don't care about democratic socialism – President Obama's approach to climate change in his 2013 State of the Union Address offers a remarkable collection of contradictions.\n\nIn a few well-chosen words, Obama on Feb. 12 cited \"the overwhelming judgment of science\" in declaring that the U.S. \"must do more to combat climate change,\" for the sake of both ourselves and our posterity, and \"before it's too late.\" Yet at the same time, he called for climate policy to advance \"strong economic growth\" that some environmentalists, at least, believe is a driver of both climate change and general environmental destruction.\n\nThe speech hailed striking advances in wind energy and solar energy production under Obama's watch, and called for more such advances in the future. Yet it likewise celebrated U.S. growth in the production of oil and gas, both fossil fuels that obviously contribute to destructive climate change. Indeed, the president promised that his administration will \"keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits,\" which could accelerate the extraction and use of both of these fossil fuels.\n\nIn calling for new federally subsidized research on new technologies in order to \"shift our cars and trucks off oil for good,\" Obama proposed to fund such research through a new Energy Security Trust funded from royalties on oil and gas production on public lands – a plan similar to one floated in the 1980s by then-Senator Bennett Johnson (D-LA), and overwhelming opposed by environmental groups at the time. They saw it as potentially hooking the renewable energy movement on addictive infusions of money generated by the oil industry.\n\nAlso in the State of the Union address, Obama made a probably obligatory reference to the desirability of Congress enacting a \"bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change\" such as that championed a few years ago by Joe Lieberman and John McCain.\n\nAnd yet – maybe very significantly – he said nothing at all in this speech about coal, whether of the \"clean coal\" variety or otherwise. National environmental groups strongly hope that his EPA will adopt and implement new rules on CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants that will reduce national consumption of this especially dirty, especially carbon-intensive fossil fuel.\n\nThe speech did not mention by name the proposed Keystone XL pipeline – an item of bitter contention between Obama's environmentalist supporters and some of the labor unions backing him. The president's address also said nothing about nuclear power, which the Heritage Foundation is touting as a promising alternative to fossil fuel production and which NASA climate scientist James Hansen has somewhat gingerly endorsed as one of many possible alternatives to continued dependence on coal, oil and natural gas.\n\nAnd although some observers strongly expect Obama's new Secretary of State, former Senator John Kerry, to pursue climate-friendly policies internationally, the State of the Union speech made no mention of global climate policy negotiations that China, the U.S., and India – the leading CO2 emitters of the world – have effectively stalemated by failing to agree on which nations need to cut greenhouse gas emissions, by how much, and by when.\n\nFinally, Obama, except in his brief allusion to the \"overwhelming judgment of science,\" said nothing about recent climate research that warns of the likely inability of the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to avoid a 2 degree Celsius rise in average global temperatures by about 2040. Such a 2 degree rise is what many scientists consider a \"tipping point\" — beyond which melting Arctic sea ice and methane releases from melting permafrost in Arctic latitudes may put greenhouse warming on steroids, sharply accelerating it and perhaps putting its control or its cessation beyond the powers of human civilization.\n\nIt is something of a Marxist cliché that history develops through contradictions\\[C5\\]. But both in his statements and in his silences, Obama in his State of the Union remarks placed before the voters some crucially important contradictions, and highlighted them in bold relief.\n\nCan the mainstream American environmental movement and more radical Green groups grasp only one pole of those contradictions, and by pushing on them hard enough, achieve real progress in tackling the climate challenge? Arguably, this is the best or perhaps the only thing the environmental groups can do legislatively for now.\n\nYet at the same time, Obama's also speech seems to offer the fossil fuel industry – with the possibly significant exception of the coal producers – a chance to grasp the other pole of these contradictions, and to push our civilization in precisely the opposite direction, towards environmental disaster.\n\nWhat this paradox in Obama's climate rhetoric signifies, of course, is that American society and the broad Democratic Party coalition that got Obama reelected are both riven by our own, very powerful contradictions. Obama's dazzlingly paradoxical formulation of energy policy reflects some stunning and possibly fatal contradictions among his supporters and those political and economic interests – including capitalist business interests – that Obama probably needs to work with to accomplish anything.\n\nAre there any smart Marxists in DSA – or any perceptive, socially-minded analysts in the various Green groups – who can unravel the contradictions both in Obama's energy rhetoric and the Democratic coalition at large, so that progressives can decide the best way to move forward on the climate issue? If so, let's hope they show the way forward – and as Obama said it himself, \"before it's too late.\"\n\n[*DSA's Green aspect*](http://dsadc.org/dsas-green-aspect/)\n\n**How Metro DC DSA Participated In the Keystone XL/Climate Rally – and What are the Next Steps?**\n\n***The Washington Socialist*** &lt;&gt; **March 2013**\n\n*By Andy Feeney and Woody Woodruff *\n\nOn Feb. 17, the largest political rally on climate change in U.S. history occurred on the National Mall. Climate activists and opponents of natural gas fracking traveleled to Washington from across the Eastern US, the South and the Midwest as well as Canada to urge President Obama to decide against completion of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline that would bring oil from the tar sands of Alberta to ports along the U.S. Gulf Coast.\n\nRally organizers claimed a turnout of at least 35,000 activists, with some sponsors estimating the crowd at nearly 50,000. Members of our Metro DC Washington chapter of DSA constituted a relatively tiny contingent of those bracing the ironically frigid weather weather and handed out fliers to the assembled climate activists, and we like to think we made a small contribution to voicing a \"socialist\" and also commonsensical position on the climate challenge. In this article, we'd like to explain to other chapter members what we said and why.\n\nFor nearly a century or more within the western social democratic left, to which DSA belongs, and even more so within the global Communist movement that flourished for 70 years following the Bolshevik Revolution, concern for nature and environmental sustainability was distinctly eclipsed by the urgent need to advance the interests of the industrial proletariat – as socialists understood it, of course – and to protect the interests of the poor.\n\nIn both the social democratic parties of the West and even more so within the Communist led governments of the Soviet bloc, the pursuit of economic growth and the fight against poverty and injustice took precedence over worries about pollution, much less protection of the environment for its own sake. Some socialists both within and outside of DSA today may still feel this is the proper focus for the left. Indeed, the subject was debated vigorously at a recent Socialist Salon on the climate issue, and a lively dialogue that began at the Salon is continuing on an informal basis within our chapter today.\n\nFor those of us who supported the Feb. 17 rally on Keystone and climate change, however, a new understanding of what Marxist philosophy and Marxist economics say about humanity's relation to nature provides a framework justifying – if not mandating – socialist involvement in environmental sustainability issues, noticeably including that of climate change.\n\nHistorically, in the class-based competition for control of nature and the class advantage that control could confer – the \"means of production,\" after all, are deeply implicated in natural resources – it was easy for all sides to forget that the natural world provides the terrain of that struggle and the essentials of human existence, water, air and soil. There is no winning the industrial or even post-industrial struggle if the terrain is lost – or, in this case, destroyed by the central materials and combatants of the struggle.\n\nWith corporate power currently holding unprecedented sway in the globalized economy, the message is to knuckle under to the \"inevitability\" of market forces in the pursuit of our lives and aspirations. Our socialist stance, on the contrary, is that private market forces are not the inevitable signal-caller of our personal and family lives nor our political lives – in a vigorous, truly democratic polity.\n\nBut the conditions of struggle are narrowing, the time horizon shortening. The secondary effects of capitalist behavior – based on extraction and combustion – threaten our lives as individuals, workers and families – and as a community.\n\nDSA's flier for the big Keystone XL protest Feb. 17 stressed the absurdity of seeking to remedy the national jobs deficit with a project that would degrade the climate and cost huge amounts for recovery from the accelerating string of \"natural\" disasters that will almost certainly follow the destructive example of Superstorm Sandy.\n\nA subtext of our flier (available on our [*Meetup page*](http://www.meetup.com/DC-DSA/) \\[tab \"more/files\"\\] unmasks the strategy of fear and anxiety that underlies corporate propaganda on issues like KXL. Only we, the corporations thunder, can provide good jobs, so shut up about this climate stuff if you hope to see the unemployment rate go down.\n\nAnd we know that every concession of power and control to the corporate power (yes, a deliberate echo of \"the slave power\") means a corresponding erosion of labor's opportunity to act in an organized, impactful way, rather than to be scattered in anxious compliance.\n\nThese are aspects of the struggle over climate change that we feel must be emphasized in a socialist analysis. To climate activists at the KXL rally, we said:\n\n\"**Why is this disastrously bad energy project even being considered by the Obama administration** and some of its allies? Because the energy companies that hope to profit from it are proposing to put money into creating the relatively few decent-paying **jobs** that many Americans in the depressed construction trades have seen for years***.***\n\n**\"Why is the future course of U.S. energy development largely being dictated by by the same corporations that have brought our nation to its knees**, both environmentally and economically? Because our formally democratic government, which is supposed to champion the public interest, is all too often in the hands of the corporate lobbyists who also dominate fundraising for both major political parties.\n\n\"The odious Keystone XL project makes obvious the web of global corporate influence that constrains democratically chosen public investments in the public interest, and that has tilted U.S. government policies into favoring and even subsidizing private investments ***against*** the public interest.\n\n\"As climate activists battle to stop the pipeline, we must tackle the wider task of reversing the stranglehold of private capital on the public's consciousness and the government's choices.\"\n\n**That stranglehold is accomplished through what Richard Grossman called \"fear at work\" – an effective weapon for corporations and banks** and their political servants, elected and otherwise, who are fighting to maintain the carbon-based status quo. Through the Tea Party, the Republican Party and rightwing think tanks, the fossil fuel industry is working to block progress on combating climate change not only by spreading mistrust of science and government but by promoting fears of job losses if Americans try to replace our carbon-based economy with a sane and greener one.\n\nBut working Americans also fear **potential higher energy costs** that the power companies are claiming would result from actually jettisoning fossil fuels and adopting alternative energy sources.\n\n\"While corporations play on our economic fears,\" our message said, \"the centuries-old, accelerating process of industrial growth under basically capitalist auspices threatens to make catastrophic planetary warming irreversible. As democratic socialists, we say **all progressive forces have to fight back for public control of this dangerous moment.\"**\n\nAnd because economics is critically important to how most voters think, climate activists must counter the economic \"Fear at Work\" campaign that the fossil fuel advocates are deploying to keep our society captive to their agenda.\n\nWorking families in the United States, those that are paying attention, rightly fear the **violent, destructive storms, droughts and** **wildfires** that already are accompanying climate change, even without the added carbon-intensive tar sands development the Keystone pipeline would facilitate.\n\nAs the Labor Network for Sustainability points out, these fears will be more than fulfilled by the effects of KXL and other mega-energy projects planned by the corporate power.\n\nTo counter Economic Fear, we said, climate activists must:\n\n-   Support not a \"carbon tax\" that people have been told will cause higher consumer prices, but instead support what climate scientist James Hansen has called a \"cap and dividend\" plan, one that would tax carbon-based fuels at the source, then use the money to fund generous tax refunds for all Americans on a per capita basis. We must work to insure that the majority will gain income – not lose it — from carbon curbs. Other labels include \"fee and dividend.\" A just-filed measure sponsored by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Barbara Boxer, the \"Climate Protection Act of 2013\" would divide the revenue more specifically, diverting about 20 percent to energy research and development, job retraining and residential weatherization. The balance would directly compensate consumers.\n\n-   Join with construction unions in fighting for more funding of needed infrastructure repair and construction projects, especially green ones, so that construction workers can have decent-paying jobs that are environmentally sustainable.\n\n-   Support pro-union legislation that promotes workplace organizing unconstrained by management threats of termination and makes union democracy essential. The decline of unions has coincided with the decline in all workers' share of advances in productivity since 1973, and the rise in corporate wealth and hegemony – hence their ability to blackmail labor and working people by withholding jobs funds from the public sector while dangling the climate-wrecking Keystone XL project as the only alternative for jobs.\n\n-   Support President Obama and political progressives – and even political conservatives, if they cooperate – in promoting greater federal funding for public transit systems and renewable energy development, again with the objective of promoting \"green\" jobs.\n\n-   Support the existing \"Blue Green Alliance\" of conservationists and labor unions in its work to promote green jobs, and support the Labor Network for Sustainability (LNS) as well.\n\n-   Strenuously oppose any deficit-driven \"Sequestration\" deal that defunds needed social programs, thus increasing the financial stress on millions of Americans and pushing them towards supporting even dirty and destructive energy projects for economic reasons.\n\n**\"Climate-friendly alternative development can support the creation of good, skilled jobs when managed by the public in its own interest – not captured by corporations,\"** our flier said. \"A key step towards such development must include support for a **publicly managed jobs program** to transition from carbon-based energy to alternative energy, but without the disruptive job losses that workers rightly fear if alternative energy development is left up to corporate and/or market forces alone.\"\n\nEven under current conditions, one study shows job gains from regulations that would phase out fossil-fuel energy sources. The study \"by Ceres and the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts ...examines the jobs effects of some of the new regulations \\[and\\] far from being \"job killers,\" the new regulations will create nearly 300,000 new jobs, especially skilled, high-pay jobs for engineers, project managers, electricians, boilermakers, pipefitters, millwrights, and iron workers,\" says Jeremy Brecher, in a piece from the Labor Network for Sustainability. \"The regulations would lead to net job increases of more than 120,000 job years in Illinois, 123,000 in Virginia, 113,000 in Tennessee, 76,000 in North Carolina, and 76,000 in Ohio,\" Brecher continues.\n\nMost such projections, however, have a transition period of four or more years, during which huge disruption to jobs, institutions, families and communities commonly take place.\n\nThe disruption to communities, in jobs, income, energy prices and other social costs, can and should be publicly managed, as well. As the Labor Network for Sustainability's Brecher article points out, an effective model exists. The Base Closing and Realignment program (BRAC) has a comprehensive approach to remedying the impacts of military base closings on dependent communities. That model, ironically enough a Pentagon product, can be applied in the cases of coastal communities needing large-scale housing shifts, for instance, as well as drought recovery in agricultural areas and many other instances of potential disruption coming from the shift away from carbon-based energy and toward alternative sources like wind (including offshore wind) and distributed solar energy. Support programs for workers and their families acquiring new skills for the green technologies that will replace the carbon energy regime – not only educational support, but living support – must be included.\n\n**In the short run** the struggle is against \"sequester\" cutbacks in social spending as well as backing public renewable energy jobs and a \"fee and dividend\" plan as the first step toward freeing American politics from the corporate politics of fear. After the Keystone XL battle is won, there will be much more to do to restore public control of resources and the health of the planet.\n\n**Alternative energy will benefit, not burden, consumers**, if working people get their say. American democracy should guarantee us a voice in what kind of energy is produced – and with what impacts on employment — and by whom. And energy has become so central to our postmodern society that putting that factor at the center of a social evolution will key the devolution of corporate capitalism into a publicly managed resource, not a top predator.\n\nThat is the essence of the socialist demand, and the path to a socialist *society* – one in which public provision is natural and \"inevitable\" – and unstigmatized – and the contributions of the market publicly managed, rather than uncontrolled and feared.\n\nBe Sociable, Share!\n\n[*Socialist Takeaways and Short Takes*](http://dsadc.org/socialist-takeaways-and-short-takes/)\n\nFriday, March 1st, 2013\n\n\n\n***LOCAL ALERTS***\n\n**DEMOCRACY IN DCDSA** –DC Metro DSA will have an election for a new Steering Committee at the March meeting.

The cuts are the result of a law signed in 2011 that was intended to pressure Congress into coming up with a plan to reduce the deficit in order to avoid draconian mandatory cuts – but Congress, true to form, never reached an agreement. The bill was the work of right-wing deficit hawks in Congress, for whom cutting taxes for the wealthy is more important than America's economic health. But President Obama and some congressional Democrats deserve a share of the blame for agreeing to the legislation that set this doomsday machine in motion. If no action is taken, the $85 billion in automatic cuts will stop the economic recovery in its tracks and shift it into reverse while ravaging vital programs such as Head Start, mental health services, public safety and job training. The [*American Federal of Government Employees*](http://www.afge.org/?page=TheyCutYouPay) and [*Americans for Tax Fairness*](http://www.americansfortaxfairness.org/) are among the progressive organizations pointing out the recklessness and absurdity of elevating deficit-cutting above all other national priorities.

One low-paid restaurant server said that missing a day amounted to a car payment; missing a weekend was a mortgage payment. Others spoke of the conflict between caring for a sick child and getting a day's pay; one day-care operator said children frequently arrived sick because their mothers couldn't afford to miss a day of work.\n\nThe growing cohort of part-time workers, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, is harder hit still – only 23 percent of part-time workers have paid sick leave.\n\nThe bill, crossfiled in House and Senate, provides for workers to earn a hour of sick time for every thirty hours of work, up to a cap of 56 hours per year. Del. John Olszewski, the lead House sponsor, said it was deliberately flexible to reduce the administrative burden on small business.\n\nThe House bill [*(SB0735)*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?id=hb0735&stab=01&pid=billpage&tab=subject3&ys=2013RS) has nearly thirty co-sponsors, including a dozen from the DC suburban counties. The Senate version (SB 0698) is sponsored by three senators from the DC suburbs – two from Montgomery and one from Prince George's.\n\nThe House Economic Matters committee, often cited as a venue where progressive bills \"go to die,\" gave a respectful hearing to the bill Feb. 27 while the gallery was packed with proponents, including many who testified. Expert testimony from Melissa Broome of the [*Job Opportunities Task Force*](http://www.jotf.org/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx) led off. She announced the formation of Working Matters, an 84-member coalition of organizations pointed directly at support for paid sick leave.\n\nA Republican House committee member did counter with selected anecdotes from [*a *Wall Street Journal* article *](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323864304578318530400767940.html)Feb. 23 that indicated some businesses in Connecticut, which began requiring sick leave last year, found it a burden. The *Journal* article, however, also noted some in Connecticut who welcomed it, and added that besides Maryland, Washington state and Massachusetts among states and cities including New York were in the process of legislating sick leave. The national average of workers without sick leave is 39 percent. Sen. Tom Harkin will introduce national sick leave coverage this spring, an effort backed by the White House and vociferously by Bill Clinton, the *Journal* article noted.\n\nThe public health impact of paid sick leave was stressed by many in a year of worse-than-average flu. Andy Shallal, owner of Busboys and Poets restaurants, testified in favor of the House bill while noting the benefits that he gained from providing it already – less turnover, higher employee morale and less illness. He pointed out, as does ROC, that giving ill food handlers the option to stay home without losing a day's pay was a critical public health issue.\n\nRepublicans on the House committee argued that the costs of paid sick leave would be a disincentive to employers wondering whether to locate in Maryland or Virginia. Proponents point out the public advantages of stable workplaces and workpaths. In the Senate hearing, bill sponsor Sen. Rob Garagiola said mitigating amendments are likely to satisfy employers' complaints, but \"there needs to be a balance of the need of the employees compared to the needs of the employers.\"\n\nThe question of whether paid sick days would increase the amount of time taken off is addressed in the fiscal note attached to the bill. It reports that \"Data from the 2008 National Health Interview Survey revealed that, when workers are limited to a maximum of 5 days of work loss, workers with paid sick days miss an average of 1.6 days annually for illness and injury, excluding maternity leave, compared with 1.4 days for those without paid sick days.\"\n\nAs the *Washington Socialist* March issue went to press Feb. 28, both bills were still alive and untouched in their respective chambers and advocates were optimistic that Maryland would set a leadership tone on the growing national issue. – *Woody Woodruff*\n\n**OFFSHORE WIND GETS STRONGER** – the almost sure passage of a (diminished) offshore wind power project undertaken by Maryland and private capital passed not only the full House of Delegates but its bigger hurdle in the Senate Finance Committee. Thanks to a reshuffling of committee members by the senate president, the bill emerged Feb. 25 at the long end of a 7-4 committee vote to go on to the Senate floor. The finance panel had been the graveyard of offshore wind bills in the two years previous.\n\nThe bill requires a significant percentage of the state's power to come from offshore wind after the first turbines are to come online offshore from Ocean City in 2017. Costs will be recouped, in part, from a surcharge on utility bills, capped at $1.50 a month for residential customers and 1.5 percent for business customers.\n\nThe amount of offshore \"acreage\" dedicated to turbines is well less than environmental groups had hoped, and now the goal will be to get future enlargement of the turbine field and hence the production, as well as to seek a public power authority component in the project as it evolves. – *Woody Woodruff*\n\n[*\"With Liberty and Justice for All\"*](http://dsadc.org/with-liberty-and-justice-for-all/)\n\n***The Washington Socialist*** &lt;&gt; **March 2013**\n*By Kurt Stand*\n\"The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd, as a liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty, especially as the sheep was a black one. Plainly the sheep and wolf are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty; and precisely the same difference prevails today among human creatures. ...\"\n\nToo often arguments about the nature of liberty, of freedom, take place in a vacuum, ignoring how the actual relationships between people – who has or does not have power – determines how such \"liberty\" is experienced. The above passage was spoken by Abraham Lincoln to describe the conflict at the core of the Civil War – and can similarly be used to address divides which still plague our society, though rarely addressed so honestly in public discourse. The right-wing and racist response to Obama's election, the fear that it means a loss of freedom, was and is driven by the fear of the equality called forth by his Inaugural Address reference to \"Seneca Falls, Selma and Stonewall.\"\n\nUnder the surface, that fear was fueled too by the fact that corporate power itself rests on numerous layers of inequality, inequality which is rationalized on the premise that any structural attempt to guarantee equality would result in a loss of \"liberty.\" Capture of that word has been the foundation of neo-liberal ideology and contributes to its appeal and seeming legitimacy. Even many who challenge the more extreme version of the neo-liberal outlook as embodied by the practices and policies of right-wing Republicanism accept too much of its underlying premises.\n\nIt is an acceptance which ignores the reality that certain forms of injustice are promoted because they benefit some at the expense of others, that those polices flow not from superior reasoning or logic, but from superior power.\n\nIt is worth recalling that the Civil War took place at a moment when the meaning of the American Revolution was still a subject to debate; Lincoln's words spoken at a time when an alternative path of development flowing from the American Revolution still seemed within grasp. Again, addressing a conflict rooted in ways of understanding what those choices were, he said: \"The world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the American people, just now are in want of one. We all declare for liberty; but in using the same word we do not mean the same thing. With some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself, and the product of his labor; while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men, and the product of other men's labor. Here are two, not only different, but incompatible things, called by the same name, liberty. And it follows that each of the things is, by the respective parties, called by two different and incompatible names – liberty and tyranny.\"\n\nHow far public discourse has moved from such considerations can be seen in a nutshell by four brief items noted without commentary in the Washington Post's Sunday Feb. 17 business section: a) Coca Cola's 4th quarter profits were up 13%. b) Pepsi Cola's net income rose 17% in that same quarter, with their divedends up 5.6% and stock shares up 1%. c) Lemann's 3G Capital – which had previously acquired Burger King and helped create the Anheuser Busch InBev beer empire – joined with Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway in purchasing Heinz. The deal was valued at $23 billion. d) A Department of Labor Survey revealed that 40 % of America's workforce isn't covered under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act. Translated into English, that means that 4 out of 10 workers can be fired if they take an unpaid day off from work to deal with a health emergency.\n\nThese are facts that speak to a connection unmentioned – the increased profits of some industries and companies is directly tied to the low wages, insecure working conditions and lack of rights for workers who create those profits. Chambers of Commerce ignore that interdependence, as does Tea Party demagoguery, as does mainstream economics. The liberty so often proclaimed is a liberty that denies the common good, for it is a liberty that privileges one group of the population over others. It is masking the reality that it is workers, not corporate presidents, who may lose their job for taking a day off when ill; it is an inequality reflected in the reality that most of those workers who are denied the benefits of the Family and Medical Leave Act are women, are immigrants, are African Americans.\n\nOvercoming those facts goes to the heart of the demands of the Restaurant Opportunities Center (ROC) – an organization founded in 1991 to fight for better pay and working conditions for low-wage, unorganized restaurant workers – for passage of the Healthy Families Act which would compel employers to grant some paid sick days off to employees, including restaurant workers, 90% of whom currently have no paid off days. Additionally, ROC is leading a campaign to increase the $2.13 minimum wage for tipped workers, an amount unchanged since 1991. Alongside that, the labor movement locally and nationally is leading a campaign to increase the general minimum wage for all workers. If successful these measures of social justice would allow those workers more freedom by compelling employers to provide what they would rather deny.\n\nBy contrast, the attempt to impose austerity as a solution to our economic woes despite the suffering that would result is an attempt to increase the freedom of the wealthy by compelling the majority to work for less. The language of shared sacrifice often used to justify cutting the deficit obscures that relationship; it can only help in the struggle against the imposition of austerity to make visible the difference in interests that has been hidden. That is not a question of language, it is a question of power. President Obama in his State of Union signaled his support for an increased federal minimum wage, for expansive social spending. But as seen in the past, there is a long rocky road between what is projected and what actually takes place – a road that can only be traversed when popular movements develop political strength able to counter the political strength of the already powerful. To do so those movements need to build on the progressive policies opened up by Obama, but need equally to take a critical approach to the limitations of his compromises. This brings us back to Lincoln. The recent movie about him gives an accurate picture of the struggle for passage of the 13th Amendment, of his ability to combine compromise with principle in order to achieve a critical step toward making US society live up to the promises of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nYet the film left out the voices of those in the trenches of the social struggles of the day, of those who did the work of abolition, for whom the goal of ending slavery was a step toward full and complete equality. The kind of movement able to support critical even if limited goals at the same time as continuing agitation and organizing for more far-reaching aims provided the basis that made the truly radical victory of ending slavery through the mechanism of legislative compromise possible. A sense of how that was viewed can be glimpsed in the conclusion of a \"Negro Suffrage Convention,\" held in New York in 1858, which called for support of the then new Republican Party but also resolved \"That in so doing, we do not for a moment endorse all the political tenets of that party, we are Radical Abolitionists, and shall ever remain so.\"\n\nToday's particular battles for medical leave and minimum wage increases that might help people move out of poverty, the general battle against economic austerity need to be fully joined for they can extend meaningful rights using the possibilities opened up by the Obama Administration in the here and now.\n\nThese will be strengthened, however, if they press deeper and further and call into question a system where a few profit at the expense of many. Just as the Civil War and the struggle to end slavery were about policies and practices that defined opposing notions of liberty, just as the labor movements origins were built on opposing employers' concept of right, so today movements for necessary measures of justice can achieve gains at the moment while fighting for a more radical vision — a vision rooted in the understanding that a genuine democracy connects freedom and equality; a connection which goes to the heart of socialism.\n\nBe Sociable, Share!","order":0},{"title":"BILL FLETCHER BRINGS HISTORY AND ANALYSIS TO THE RACE/CLASS TANGLE","date":"2016-02-02","issue":"February 2016","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"Veteran activist and author Bill Fletcher Jr., believes the Bernie Sanders campaign needs to \"expand its narrative\" to include concerns and question of potential supporters beyond his largely white base and beyond the perspective of his hero, the socialist Eugene Debs, that \"if you solve capitalism you've solved it all.\"\n\nFletcher shared his ideas on building a new, broad Left coalition at the Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America's Socialist Salon Jan. 28. Fletcher, a labor strategist and theoretician with deep experience in the Jesse Jackson presidential campaigns of the 1980s, spoke to a packed dining room of nearly 40 about the prospects for a left electoral strategy that addresses the immediate opportunity of the Sanders campaign but has a long-game strategy as well to match the right wing's successful movement-building approach.\n\n\"Here we go again on the left—we have nothing that resembles an electoral strategy,\" Fletcher began. He described a cycle in which left activists work on electoral campaigns and are so alienated by the process that they immediately drop out of electoral work until the next cycle four years later, starting all over again.\n\nFletcher compared the well-documented ground-game strategy of the right beginning with Richard Viguerie's direct-mail campaigns in the 1960s after the smashing defeat of GOP presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, building state-level organizations aiming \"to reverse the 20<sup>th</sup> century.\" Viguerie's approach to organizing also contributed to coalescing the conservative base that would elect Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\nIn contrast, for left activists electoral politics were felt to be \"insufficiently revolutionary,\" Fletcher recalled, with the exception of the black electoral effort in the decades following the civil rights era of the 1960s and '70s leading to the Jackson campaign, which was specific and had a city by city movement-building approach.\n\nThe right had an issue focus that allowed them to use guns and abortion, e.g., to capture non-urban areas and large sections of the white working class \"to build a total reactionary movement.\" Unlike the left, they didn't expect total agreement ie: gun lobby supports might not be anti-choice, anti-choice activists were expected to demonstrate for the Second Amendment. But the right did create a narrative around which they could mobilize their otherwise disparate base.\n\n\n\nFletcher called right-wing populism \"the herpes of politics\" because it plays on elements endemic in the political system and erupts every time the system becomes compromised – whenever anxieties arise the theme (\"narrative\") is the victimization of whites.\n\nFletcher anatomized the mistakes of the left, playing out again in this electoral cycle:\n\nThe Sanders campaign, he said, is creating a \"narrow narrative\" compared to the more inclusive Jackson campaigns. For example, Sanders' campaign doesn't reach important constituencies that it could and \"doesn't include the questions that many people are seeking the answers to – it's not the full picture.\" Though supporters often argue that it is a groundbreaking assault on inequalities in the capitalist system, Bernie is \"dizzy with success\" and doesn't realize that doing better than expected is still not doing everything he can.\n\nFletcher faulted Sanders for being in elective office for several decades but doing little to try and use his position to mobilize a broad social movement to bring the Left back into electoral politics. Additionally, he pointed to Sanders' lack of effort to address problems of racism and sexism that cannot be explained by economics alone.\n\n\n\nSanders' campaign references both \"racist oppression and capitalist exploitation\" but \"some populations are way worse off \\[in this equation\\] and need more help,\" Fletcher argued. Sanders talks about jobs and rebuilding the middle class, Fletcher said, but \"when another policeman kills a black person, Sanders seems unable to connect the issues or address the underlying racism that still exists in the country.\"\n\nJackson got wild approval from white farmers and workers because he could connect their lives and issues to the broader narrative. Unlike Jackson, Sanders is not seen as \"their champion\" by people who are unlike him. Sanders is an inspirational \"leader\" but \"we need an organizer\" as well, Fletcher said.\n\nSanders's veneration of Eugene Debs is telling, Fletcher said. \"Debs was a complicated man and the Socialist Party was \\[a\\] complicated\" political formation in Debs' day. And Debs believed \"philosophically that if you solve capitalism you solve it all.\" In fact there are no \"common economic demands\" that can unify people across race lines, Fletcher declared.\n\nIn an article posted in August 2015 on national DSA's [**Democratic Left**](http://www.dsausa.org/democratic_left) blog, Fletcher declared: \"The sort of \"political revolution\" that the Sanders Campaign proclaims has been a long time coming. Yet it will never arrive if there is not a full recognition that the class struggle overlaps that of racial justice. The ruling elites, for several centuries, have appreciated that race is the trip wire of U.S. politics and social movements. When will progressives arrive at the same conclusion?\"\n\nFletcher reflected on his early days in 1960s-'70s politics when he opted out of electoral politics, thinking they were irrelevant. He has come to a different place after years of working in grassroots campaigns and realizing that change can only come systematically through regular involvement in the political process.\n\nAmong questions addressed to Fletcher after his formal talk, one queried whether left activists should work with Democrats or seek an independent electoral strategy. Fletcher recommends an inside-outside strategy, because the \"two-party grip\" on US politics \"makes it hard for a third party to emerge.\" Within this strategy for the immediate campaign, Sanders' narrative has to expand. Fletcher said dismissively that \"these sectarian debates \\[about the Democratic Party\\] are not worth having any more.\" Activists in this cause \"don't have to agree on everything ... let's just get people together who aren't going to shoot at each other. ... We are the left that is interested in electoral politics –even though we hate it.\"\n\nFletcher advocates, instead, assembling a leadership whose members can find common ground on a few key issues and outline a strategy to address them. He favors local action to get progressive candidates onto school boards, city councils, and into state legislatures – \"I want us to take over Texas, take over Alabama,\" he said. \"The right wing has been able to convince people in places like that that the Koch brothers are their friends\" when this thinking really backfires on them.\n\nWhy has labor – where Fletcher has been engaged as a rank-and-file activist, educator and strategist much of his life– become so weak? Fletcher responded with history: \"Labor was devastated\" by the Taft-Hartley Act's restrictions on organizing and by the Cold War anticommunism that stripped activists out of the union movement and reinforced Gompers-style business unionism. Coupled with the radical changes in the economy of the 70s that diverted more and more resources away from workers and into financial capitalism, the effect has been like the frog in a pot who is brought to boil incrementally without noticing his own demise.\n\nAsked about remedies for the right's dominance at the state and congressional level, Fletcher counseled left unity on a scale well beyond temporary alliances created by Sanders's advocacy of democratic socialism. Somebody, he said, \"has to call a meeting\" to build a real bloc for a city by city left campaign to disrupt the right's well organized and well financed grip by striking at the heart of its power. In trying to build a bloc, he said, who gets to be at the table is more important than who calls the meeting. Fletcher's book [**Solidarity Divided**](https://books.google.com/books/about/Solidarity_Divided.html?id=At048traA3IC&source=kp_cover) expands on some of those themes.\n\nFletcher argued for a continued electoral strategy, a \"long game\" to match that of the right. He acknowledged that the chance for cross-racial unity was complicated by an \"anarcho-reformist\" strain within some recent, youth-driven movements like Black Lives Matter. The strategy as he described it was to engage instead in street actions that would \"force elites to do what we want them to do.\" BLM is resistant to talking about class because \"it is a way of obscuring race\" as a salient issue.\n\nFor more of Fletcher's views, check out his website [*http://billfletcherjr.com/*](http://billfletcherjr.com/) or tune into Arise, his weekly radio program on labor issues (WPFW – 89.3 FM – Friday mornings at 9 a.m.\n\n*Carolyn Byerly and Kurt Stand contributed to this article.*\n\n*The Socialist Salon of Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America meets monthly over dinner to hear and discuss issues of socialist politics and analysis.

The study estimated that we could lower projected temperatures in midcentury by 0.5 degrees C. Methane can trap 84 times as much heat as CO2 in the first 20 years after it enters the atmosphere. Sources include coal mines, fossil fuel producers and landfills. Also, cattle production facilities and rice paddies contribute as biological sources.\n\nCutting methane emissions is also cheaper and easier than replacing fossil fuels, but sources are widespread and natural emission of methane will increase as climate change warms permafrost in Arctic regions.\n\nThe [current natural gas leak at Porter Ranch, California](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-porter-ranch-senators-review-20160129-story.html) is a dramatic example of how serious methane leaks can be and how difficult methane leak reduction could be in a world of low-rent capitalist management of energy resources. Erin Brockovich has compared it to a BP Oil spill on land.\n\nThe leak was discovered at Southern California Gas Company's Aliso Canyon storage field in late October. This is an underground storage facility created by capping a former natural gas well. Since its discovery, the leak has spewed 84 million kilograms of methane. At its peak, it was leaking 58,000 kil/hr but much more recently this was down two-thirds to about 18,400 kil/hr.\n\nThe amount is equivalent to the greenhouse effect of 440,000 cars over a one-year period. It is twice the annual greenhouse emissions of Los Angeles, and, [according to Counterpunch](http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/01/22/the-porter-ranch-gas-leak-blame-jerry-brown/), it is thought fracking may have played a role in creating the leak.\n\nSouthern California Gas Company is digging a second well to reach and cap the leak, which is 8,000 feet under the surface. But the leak probably won't be stopped until sometime in February, according to the company's claim. In the meantime, 26,000 families have fled from their homes to escape the foul-smelling gas. Many have suffered nosebleeds, headaches and respiratory distress.\n\nSouthern California Gas Company has had to pay Porter Ranch residents for temporary housing in area hotels and residents' lives have been turned upside down. Real estate values and small businesses have been adversely affected.\n\nIn respond to the state of emergency that Governor Jerry Brown finally declared, the California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources has issued a notice to adopt emergency regulation for natural gas storage facilities that would require ongoing monitoring. There are 330 such facilities in California alone, according to Counterpunch. But Linda Caputo, an activist with 350.org, says the regulations need to be \"much tougher.\" California's two Senate members have most recently called for a full-dress investigation by the Energy Department.\n\nLeaky methane is a problem throughout the United States. As gas lines age, our older cities, especially, are bleeding methane. A study released in 2014 by researchers from Duke and Boston Universities found 5,893 natural gas leaks in the District of Columbia alone.\n\nCars carrying special monitors and GPS equipment covered 1,500 miles of roads in DC. They produced maps showing the locations of leaks. They also found leaks with high concentrations of methane and decided to probe beneath manholes where they detected leaking. Twelve of these had concentrations high enough to cause explosions. They reported these, but to their dismay, on returning four months later, found that nine of these were still emitting dangerous levels of gas. They also conducted a survey in Boston and found a similar number of leaks per mile, [according to USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/16/washington-dc-gas-pipeline-leaks/4497083/).\n\nOlder cities have pipes made of cast iron or steel that need replacing with newer PVC pipes. The Duke study recommended that other cities conduct gas leaks mapping.\n\nU.S. Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts has introduced legislation to fund the replacement of leaking gas pipes nationwide. Also, President Obama has just proposed new rules to regulate the release and flaring of natural gas on public lands, according to the journal Oil and Gas Investor.\n\nIt appears that after much pressure from activists and angry citizens, combined with new research findings, the government is finally clamping down on these sources of methane emissions. It remains to be seen how this will affect fracking, which is a major source of methane leaks.\n\n[*GOOD READS FOR SOCIALISTS &lt;&gt;FEBRUARY 2016*](http://dsadc.org/good-reads-for-socialists-february-2016/)\n\nSunday, January 31st, 2016","order":2},{"title":"GOOD READS FOR SOCIALISTS","date":"2016-02-02","issue":"February 2016","author":"","body":"Welcome to February – a Leap Year, so one extra day for reading.

But judging from last month's meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, another big shock to the international labor force is due soon.\n\nAccording to a WEF report issued in connection with this year's Davos gathering, a pending \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\" driven by robots, online commerce, new advances in biotechnology and other disruptive technologies is likely to eliminate roughly another 7 million jobs worldwide between now and 2020. The same technically driven business revolution should create another 2 million new jobs, chiefly in high technology, for a net loss of 5 million jobs in the next half decade.\n\nTechnology-driven job losses for men and women will be approximately equal in absolute terms, the WEF report predicts. Yet due to existing gender imbalances in the most affected industries, women will lose five jobs for every new one they gain while men will lose only three. In sum, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will likely damage the employment prospects of both men and women while further worsening existing gender imbalances in the worldwide labor force. See [*http://reports.weforum.org/future-of-jobs-2016/women-and-work-in-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/*](http://reports.weforum.org/future-of-jobs-2016/women-and-work-in-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/) .\n\nThe WEF's alarming predictions are consistent with what Martin Ford, a long-time Silicon Valley entrepreneur with 25 years' experience in computer design and software development, has forecast for the global job market in his new book *Rise of the Robots.* Ford devotes little time to exploring the expected gender or racial impacts of the robotics revolution – a real shortcoming in his book, compared to the WEF's report. But his overall analysis of what robotics, automation and related technological developments should mean for working people is even grimmer than the WEC's, and yet in some ways, much more interesting.\n\nWith his long experience in the computer and electronics industry, Ford has detailed knowledge of some of the technological breakthroughs that he sees as driving future employment impacts of potentially horrifying dimensions. He likewise has clearly thought a lot about some big economic trends that have shaped capitalist civilization since the first Industrial Revolution, including the dramatic rise toward increased income inequality that the United States and other rich western societies have experienced over the past several decades.\n\nBy marrying his insight into new technological innovations, some of them virtually unknown to the public, to his knowledge of broad economic trends, Ford has produced a book that should be of equal interest to computer geeks and labor economists. Unfortunately, its implications for a large fraction of humanity both here in the US and in low-wage developing economies overseas are frightening in the extreme, but at the same time the scope and the technical intricacies of the automation revolution we are undergoing are fascinating.\n\nIn the introduction to *Rise of the Robots*, Ford grounds his analysis in Moore's Law, the well-known idea in the computer field that for a variety of reasons, the overall power of computers tends to double approximately once in approximately every 18 months.\n\nIn the real world, Ford indicates, advances in microchip design, software programs and other variables have in fact enabled computing power to double some 27 times since the integrated circuit was invented in 1958. Thanks to the magic of exponential growth, this means today's technology is about 134 million times as powerful as computers were back in the early Sputnik age. This astonishing rate of progress in computer capabilities has provided the platform for the advancement of the robotics revolution, although the development of robots capable of performing particular job categories has depended on sometimes quirky circumstances.\n\nTake for example Ford's description of a robot recently designed by engineers at Industrial Perception, Inc., a small startup company in Silicon Valley, which has the ability to see well enough to stack, restack and unstack different boxes in an industrial warehouse setting.\n\nBefore the invention of Industrial Perception's warehouse robot, Ford writes, there already were industrial robots employed in doing many detailed manufacturing tasks, and some of these industrial robots had visual abilities. Yet until recently even the sighted machines lacked the capacity to see in three dimensions, and their inability to perceive depth gave them a limited ability to function in settings that were \"to any meaningful degree unpredictable\" – such as the selective stacking and unstacking of differently sized and shaped boxes in warehouses, for example. The result has been that in most warehouse settings, and in some other industrial settings as well, certain tasks have been kept open for human beings.\n\nIn 2006, however, the toymaker Nintendo introduced its innovative Wii game console, which included a wireless wand containing a new motion-detecting device called an accelerometer. An accelerometer, as it happens, is a device that can detect motion in three dimensions. Sony Corporation, a rival to Nintendo in the game market, then introduced its own motion-detecting wand in its popular PlayStations. Microsoft, a rival to both Sony and Nintendo in the game market, then leapfrogged its competitors by adding a feature to its Xbox 360 game console that uses infrared technology to \"see\" the actions of game players in three dimensions, even without a wand.\n\nThe new Microsoft add-on to the Xbox, priced at $1.50 a unit, for the first time gave robotics researchers in the universities as well as tinkerers and hobbyists a cheap way to build machines with three-dimensional vision, Ford reports. Almost instantly, would-be developers responded by creating such robots, and Industrial Perception's automated warehouse worker soon followed.\n\nThanks ultimately to the revolutionary improvement of computing abilities according to Moore's Law, but thanks in this particular instances to rival developers of electronic games for children making improvements to Wii, PlayStation and XBox, corporate owners of industrial warehouses throughout our economy may soon have the ability to reduce warehouse operating costs by replacing relatively low-wage human workers with machines. Indeed, by the time *Rise of the Robots* was going to press, Ford noted that such warehouse giants as Amazon and the Kroger retail grocery chain had both begun to invest significantly in the robot option.\n\nFord, like some other recent writers on robotics and automation, goes to some trouble to demonstrate that low-paid, relatively low-skilled industrial workers are not the only potential victims of thinking machines in the economy. White-collar jobs are also at risk. Clever researchers and designers also have created automated systems that can compose musical symphonies, Ford observes; there is an existing program called Quill, commercialized by a startup company called Narrative Science, Inc., that can write short but coherent news stories for use in newspapers or over the Internet. Large automobile companies as well as Google already are at work trying to develop automated, driverless cars that can function well in traffic.\n\nSimilarly, some white-collar professionals in large corporations are at risk of losing their jobs to an \"intelligent software platform\" developed by a New York City startup company called WorkFusion, whose program \"completely manages the execution of projects that were once highly labor-intensive through a combination of crowd sourcing and automation.\" Today radiologists typically need 13 years of training beyond high school to develop the skills needed to interpret medical images accurately, Ford writes, and yet computers are getting increasingly good at this task. In the fairly near future, accordingly, \"it's quite easy to imagine that ... radiology will be a job performed almost entirely by machines.\"\n\nFord therefore argues that the robotics revolution poses a significant threat to the future of today's college students and recent graduates, who already in many cases are going deeply into debt to prepare themselves for well-paid professional jobs that don't become readily available after graduation. As the automation and robotization of currently high-skilled white-collar jobs accelerates, new university graduates could face even greater challenges in obtaining jobs that will pay well enough to repay their costs of university educations.\n\nYet although he's concerned about robotization dimming the job prospects of many white collar and professional workers, Ford predicts that the automation revolution will have its most damaging results among low-wage and relatively unskilled workers, both in the United States and other advanced western companies and in the emerging economies of Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe most important job losses resulting from industrial robots will likely occur in China and other Asian economies where a large fraction of industrial manufacturing occurs, Ford believes. The increasing automation of low-paid agricultural work poses an enormous threat to the large agricultural workforces of African and Asian economies, and by a cruel irony of economic history, people who are driven off the land in these countries will probably not be able to follow the example of European peasants who were forced off their lands during the First Industrial Revolution and forced to find factory work in the cities – for in the Third World cities of the future, many of the factories are likely to be highly automated.\n\nHere in the United States where the service sector now provides the most jobs, Ford concludes that the major employment impacts of automation and robotics are likely to occur in the fast food business, in the restaurant industry more generally, in some job categories within the educational and health care sectors, and in retail stores of all descriptions. Although robots and automation are growing ever more sophisticated and potentially threaten white collar workers performing relatively complex tasks, it is easier to design machines that can replace human labor in relatively simple and repetitive jobs, and such jobs are generally found at the bottom of the wage scale, not the top.\n\nFor this reason and other, more complicated ones that Ford articulates in the book but are too cumbersome to explain here, *Rise of the Robots* predicts that the increasing capabilities of thinking machines will contribute to, if they are not already major contributing causes to, such ongoing social and economic problems as increasing income inequality and the growing domination of politics in the United States by a highly automated financial sector and the super-rich.\n\nHow can the employment challenges and other negative economic aspects of the robot revolution be mitigated and/or prevented? Ford considers the idea some observers have floated, of trying to prevent the ongoing robotization of work either through government fiat or moral and economic appeals to employers, only to reject it.\n\nThus he cites the argument of Nicholas Carr, a contributor to *The* *Atlantic*, that computer programmers and designers have mistakenly adopted \"technology-centered automation\" as a \"dominant design philosophy\" that has induced them to design systems that prioritize the needs of technology over the needs of human beings. He also notes a \"New Grand Challenge\" that MIT economist Erik Brynjolfsson has issued to \"entrepreneurs, engineers and economists\" urging them to use technology to invent systems that are complements to human labor, not substitutes for it. As quoted by Ford, Brynjolfsson has called for such engineers and entrepreneurs to replace their \"labor-saving and automation mindset\" with a \"maker and creator mindset.\"\n\nThe problem is that this makes no economic sense, Ford argues. To wit:\n\n\"The bottom line is that, despite all the rhetoric about 'job creators,' rational business owners do *not want* to hire more workers; they hire people only because they have to. The progression toward ever more automation is not an artifact of \"design philosophy' or the personal preferences of engineers; it is fundamentally driven by capitalism.\"\n\nRather than the \"rise of technology-centered automation\" being the new problem that *The Atlantic* has described, Ford continues, it began at least 200 years ago during the first Industrial Revolution. \"The only difference today,\" in his view, \"is that exponential progress is now pushing us toward the endgame. For any rational business, the adoption of labor-saving technology will almost invariably prove to be irresistible. Changing that would require far more than an appeal to engineers and designers; it would require modifying the basic incentives build into the market economy.\"\n\nOne radical but seemingly logical way of handling the problem of the employment impacts and growing economic inequality that are being generated by automation and related technologies, Ford suggests, would be to make \"everyone a capitalist,\" by distributing the ownership of the companies doing automation much more widely, so that everyone could gain from the economic efficiencies associated with robotics and even those who lose their jobs because of it might benefit. But given the already bitter polarization of politics in the United States, Ford thinks large-scale redistribution of capital in our society is even less likely than a large-scale redistribution of income.\n\nYet Ford's major recommendation on how to handle the job effects of increasing automation is based on an argument that is designed to appeal to economic elites, and potentially even conservatives. It is that ongoing automation, rising levels of unemployment, falling wages and growing inequality will weaken consumer purchasing power in any capitalist economy and, by weakening the purchasing power of the lower classes, will ultimately hurt economic growth. It might possibly be argued that job losses, low wages, high poverty rates and economic injustice are economic, social and even moral evils in themselves, but whatever Ford may believe, he doesn't rely on this argument; he instead focuses on the threat to \"continued prosperity\" and economic growth.\n\nHis main solution to the economic dislocations to be expected from advanced computer technologies also is a \"conservative\" one, at least in a sense. To maintain a prosperous capitalist economy and maintain the consumer purchasing power of those displaced by technology even as robotization continues, Ford suggests, we should adopt a \"universal basic income\" as proposed several decades ago by the rightwing conservative economist F.A. Hayek. Although the government spending taxpayer money to provide a basic income to everyone would seem in flat contradiction to almost everything that American conservatives believe today, such a basic income would not only help to stabilize consumer markets and make for a more stable market economy; it might even make most Americans more willing to gamble their savings on investments in capitalist technological progress, and be good for entrepreneurship – an important conservative value.\n\nThe chances of a guaranteed universal income being adopted soon are nil, Ford concedes, but as the robotics revolution continues accelerating and its economic and social dangers become more obvious, policy preferences may change, even among the conservatives. In the meantime, in the absence of a universal guaranteed income, Ford identifies several temporary, somewhat stopgap measures that he thinks would help. They include first, a national program to rebuild the nation's crumbling infrastructure (as Bernie Sanders has proposed, although Ford obviously does not cite Sanders in support of this goal).\n\nA second near-term priority for handling the robotics and unemployment crisis, according to Ford, is increasing the nation's investment in community colleges. Ford is skeptical of trying to address the robotization challenge through education alone, as noted above, since so many of today's college graduates already are forced to work at jobs that don't make use of their education. Yet in general, \"community colleges represent one of our most important resources for enabling workers to navigate an increasingly dynamic job market,\" and Ford recommends doing \"everything possible\" to make it easier for displaced workers to get retrained through community colleges.\n\nTwo additional near-terms palliatives for technology-induced unemployment that Ford admits are politically contentious are (a) expanding the existing Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income parents to increase its maximum benefits and open it up to single people who are between jobs – thus, Ford admits, moving it closer to being a universal guaranteed income; and (b) shifting federal taxes that support important social programs away from payroll taxes, which essentially punish corporations with large workforces, and toward \" a form of taxation that asks more from those businesses that rely heavily on technology and employ relatively few workers.\"\n\nFinally, Ford comments, there is one policy idea that ought to be obvious to everyone in this age of growing technology-induced jobs uncertainty. Given today's technology trends, \"it seems evident that we should not now be setting out to dismantle the social safety net we now have in place.\" If there is any good time to slash social programs that serve the most vulnerable members of the U.S. population, Ford concludes, \"then surely, *this is not that time.\"*\n\nThere are many other economic and technological themes in Ford's book that cannot be summarized here, and democratic socialists may find fault with some of them. For example, Ford provides an extended technological argument against the common conception among mainstream economists, including many liberal economists, about job losses caused by robots and automation likely being temporary, since new and possibly better jobs are likely to be created as technology-based \"creative destruction\" proceeds. This has generally been true in the past, Ford concedes, but he argues that for both technical and economic reasons, it probably won't be true this time. Whether or not readers of the *Washington Socialist* ultimately agree with Ford's conclusions on this and other topics, it would be good for some of us to master Ford's reasoning to find out.\n\n[*Maryland: HOGAN BUDGET DROPS, AND THE FUN BEGINS IN EARNEST*](http://dsadc.org/maryland-hogan-budget-drops-and-the-fun-begins-in-earnest/)\n\nSunday, January 31st, 2016\n\n***The Washington Socialist*&lt;&gt;February 2016**\n\n*By Woody Woodruff*\n\nNow that Republican Gov. Larry Hogan has dropped his budget on Maryland's Democratic-dominated General Assembly, the fussing and feuding about resources can begin. The budget is comfortably in surplus, but Hogan's passive-aggressive touch is visible throughout, as Department of Legislative Services director and longtime budget guru Warren Deschenaux discreetly pointed out in his briefing to the legislators (pdf [*here*](http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frm1st.aspx?tab=home) \"fiscal briefings\" under the green \"Budget\" tab). The legislature can move money around but not increase the governor's budget total without finding entirely new revenue sources.\n\nIn a year when money is less tight, ideology may regain some prominence in the legislative battles in this 90-day session between now and mid-April. The tone has been set early by the Assembly's override of five out of Hogan's six vetoes from last year. The remaining, perhaps most narrowly contested, override vote is to affirm a law passed last year giving the vote to ex-offenders, which Hogan vetoed. The House of Delegates successfully overrode that veto, but Senate President Mike Miller is waiting for the governor's appointment of a new senator from Montgomery County. The former senator in that district resigned and the county's Democratic Central Committee has nominating a sitting Delegate to replace her. Such appointments are generally a matter of courtesy. But Miller has scheduled the override vote Feb. 5. Neither of the bicameral legislature's chamber leaders, Miller or House Speaker Mike Busch, is a firebrand, but the Assembly is always ready to push back against a governor of the opposite party, and that can give impetus to progressive legislation that might otherwise languish.\n\nAs the region worked through a nearly two-foot blizzard the last week of January, the Assembly made a great show of continuing its work. In fact the House held numerous hearings on its 500-plus bills already filed. The Senate, about a third the House's size, had, by contrast, filed a mere 27 bills by the Friday before Feb. 1's resumption of business.\n\nThere is a fair amount of [*extra money available*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-assembly-budget-20160121-story.html) to be moved around in the Hogan budget. The Baltimore *Sun*'s Pamela Wood's rough estimate of Jan. 22 noted that \"The proposed operating budget leaves about $450 million unspent.Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expect to debate whether to spend the money, hold onto it or return some of it to taxpayers.\"\n\nOne complication for the leadership is that many of the legislators will come in with pet local projects to be funded by state bonds. However, no pot of money has been included in the budget for that. That represents a bit of a time bomb of omission by Hogan. Setting statewide budgeting priorities of the Assembly against the legislators' needs locally is a potential divide-and-conquer strategy.\n\nBaltimore catches the worst barbs in Hogan's budget – that'll teach them to riot over police use of deadly force in Larry Hogan's state. He has already canceled the much-wished-for Red Line mass transit project there. He's provided none of the promised money for demolition of blighted blocks (it's now promised... later). A $24 million cut in the city's school funding is said due to declining enrollment, but other rural systems with declining enrollment get more than last year.\n\nPrince George's – though Hogan grew up there in its white-folks political era and is the son of a local congressman – gets zero operational money for its [*planned new hospital*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bal-miller-busch-plan-spending-mandate-for-new-prince-georges-hospital-20160126-story.html). Aggravated legislators included Senate President Miller, who vowed that if the governor doesn't add the $15 million needed in a supplemental this year the legislature will pass a bill mandating spending $30 million for hospital operations (transitioning to University of Maryland teaching-hospital status) next year as catch-up.\n\nA panel of lawmakers put together a 22-item session agenda for police reform that notably includes changes to the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights, a framework that has made it difficult for citizens and other criminal justice officials to hold officers accountable for misconduct, including use of excessive force. Activists have said that Maryland's version of LEOBOR, which exists in many other states, is the worst of any state in blocking reform and accountability. Del. Curt Anderson (D-Baltimore) has spearheaded the panel and promotes a bill that along with LEOBOR reform \"would grant more rights to victims of police brutality ... create a unified complaint system for tracking problem officers and allow the public to watch police disciplinary boards,\" [*the Baltimore *Sun* reported*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-policing-group-20160111-story.html).\n\nThe legislators are still steamed over Hogan's refusal in the last session to provide the mandated extra geographical schools subsidy to major urbanized jurisdictions (Baltimore City, Montgomery and Prince George's counties – none of which voted for him) while slipping extra cash to rural districts where he did well. They passed a law last year requiring him to spend that money this year, so he has.\n\nState employees have a hypothetical raise that is, um, not funded, meaning the legislators will also have to scrounge funds for that from the fast-shrinking stash of movable money. There is money, however, for individual-increment step raises. To the extent those have a \"merit\" dimension that could devolve a lot of arbitrary power to Hogan's agency heads. Hogan is proposing to cut state positions (not necessarily workers) by 553, out of roughly 50,000 in the executive/agency category.\n\nSome places and vested interests make out well, though, in this document – Hogan budgets $5 million to subsidize corporate contributions to private schools. Small businesses and low-income taxpayers get cuts in fees and taxes, reducing revenue by $23 million. Giveaways to the affluent may be buried in the budget but nobody (including Deschenaux) has found them yet, other than the [*tax breaks for contributions to private schools*](http://marylandreporter.com/2016/01/27/hogan-announces-education-initiatives-early-graduation-gift/). A very recent proposal for college scholarships to students who finish high school early is getting a hard look from some Democrats and educators who worry that such students will not be academically or emotionally prepared for college. The possibility that this could be a boondoggle for students from affluent families who have already accumulated the demonstrated education-coping skills associated with that economic class has not been brought up.\n\nThe legislature has some money to play with as noted above, including $25 million more in the pension fund supplemental than required. The annual supplemental aims to bring the pension fund to full funding sometime in the next decade. But it will be scrambled for by all, including those with (above) local bond issues to guarantee.\n\nChipping away Hogan-style at unionized state employees continues, as *Union City* reported Jan. 27: \"**MD Cooks and PT Aides Fight for Jobs:** Seventy food service and physical therapy employees at state hospitals in Maryland are fighting for their jobs after being targeted by Maryland governor Larry Hogan, reports their union, AFSCME 3.\" The [*current effort at worker privatization*](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-state-layoffs-20160126-story.html) targets hospitals and juvenile relief centers\n\nA high and hoped-for priority this year, after three years of being blocked in committees, is the earned paid sick leave effort. In the early going it appears packaged by influential Democrats with several other measures[ *billed as improving the lot of working women*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/maryland-democrats-push-labor-bills-they-say-will-help-working-women/2016/01/27/ac8685f2-c520-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce_story.html), along with a \"just hours\" measure that would prevent employers from juking employees' schedules around, disrupting family life and educational efforts. The powerful Senate Majority Leader, Baltimore's Catherine Pugh, is a co-sponsor of the sick leave bill (she is a candidate for mayor in that city) and Prince George's Del. Dereck Davis, the chair of the House Economic Matters Committee that has buried the sick leave bill for three straight years, is now running for the open District 4 Congressional seat and has told activists he will prioritize getting that bill to the floor this year. When Senate President Miller was asked his position on paid sick leave, however, he shifted the topic, saying his priority this year was closing the male-female pay gap.\n\nPaid sick leave legislation has recently been the target of [*a poll funded by opponents*](http://thedailyrecord.com/2016/01/26/md-paid-sick-leave-proponents-call-poll-fear-mongering/), claiming that support for the bill dropped off when questions were added about potential costs to business and job loss. Those were \"scare tactics,\" said Melissa Broome of the [*Job Opportunities Task Force*](http://www.jotf.org/). \"The hypothetical effects that (the poll) raises are not backed up with facts,\" Broome said.\n\nEnvironmental groups are pushing bills to ban plastic bags and put deposits on plastic drink bottles, as well as ban the neonicotinoid pesticides that, it is increasingly certain, are devastating pollinator populations including bees. But a major battle over electric power provision involves several bills that will increase the targets for the portion of electric power that comes from renewable sources. One of these, the [*Clean Energy Jobs Act*](http://marylandclimatecoalition.org/top-md-lawmakers-push-clean-energy-expansion-record-large-jobs-bill-first-day-general-assembly/), will be sweetened with $40 million dedicated to training for green jobs and bolstering the participation of women- and minority-owned businesses in the clean energy trade. Those big numbers are getting interest from legislators who have been tougher to get to for the largely white environmental groups in the past.\n\nAdvocacy groups are already lining up Lobby Nights, mostly for Monday evenings when the legislators hold office hours before the week's one evening session. Enviro groups have a Feb. 8 citizen lobby night for [*Prince George's and Anne Arundel county*](http://org.salsalabs.com/o/423/p/salsa/event/common/public/?event_KEY=85235) activists planned, plus one March 7 for [*Montgomery and Western Maryland*](http://chesapeakeclimate.org/event/western-md-and-montgomery-county-lobby-night/), and the [*Maryland AFL-CIO political operation*](http://md.aflcio.org/mddcstatefed/) lobbies every Monday night, meeting at their Annapolis lobby shop beforehand.

We can work in coalition with groups like [*Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ)*](http://www.showingupforracialjustice.org/)\n\nSURJ is a national network of groups (over 100 throughout the country) and individuals organizing white people for racial justice. Through community organizing, mobilizing, and education, SURJ moves white people to act as part of a multi-racial majority. It provides a both a national and local \"one-stop shop\" for finding out about events and learning more about racial justice.\n\nAccording to SURJ, the need for such an organization became evident when participants in the post-Ferguson actions and protests responded to reports that there also has been tension about how some white people specifically were showing up in a non-helpful way. SURJ was asked by people of color for two things:\n\n-   \\*\\*To show up at actions called and organized by People of Color (POC)\n\n-   \\*\\*To organize actions as white people to call attention to anti-Black racism and the threat to black lives and the lives of people of color\n\nSURJ has sterling credentials. It was founded in 2009 in response to a call – by people of color and whites engaged in racial justice work – for more white people to challenge the racial backlash after President Obama's election. It focuses on working with people who, like us, are already \"in motion.\" SURJ (formerly US for All of Us: No Room for Racism) comes out of the Highlander Research and Education Center, formerly known as the Highlander Folk School, a social justice leadership training school and cultural center founded in 1932 and currently located in New Market, Tennessee. Highlander has provided training and education for the labor movement in Appalachia and throughout the Southern United States. It played a critical role in the American Civil Rights Movement; among its trainees were Rosa Parks, John Lewis and other members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ralph Abernathy.\n\nThe SURJ website is rich in educational resources [*(see checklist, related article)*](http://dsadc.org/reshaping-yourself-and-your-surroundings-as-anti-racist-tips-from-surj/) and contains information on actions that parallel much of what DSA does around organizing; therefore, it can be useful for purposes of both anti-racism work and organizing in general. These include the following: notices of periodic \"basebuilding\" national telephone calls on such topics as strategies for rural and small-town organizing, combating anti-Arab racism and Islamophobia [*(see related article)*](http://dsadc.org/fighting-the-current-scourge-of-islamophobia/); action toolkits on how to undertake actions, including talking points for the media and messaging on such topics as police accountability and criminalization as well as a toolkit on how to start a SURJ chapters; yard signs; and a search tool to find local actions.\n\nNationally, DSA chapters and SURJ chapters and affiliates are co-located in about 30 cities, creating a great opportunity to collaborate with like-minded people. Activities such as joint reading groups on race and class, for example, could be explored. In addition, places where there are DSA chapters and where SURJ does not exist provide an opportunity for DSA to develop affiliates of SURJ. Where SURJ exists and DSA does not have a chapter, individual DSA members will undoubtedly find a welcoming home for racial justice work.\n\nIn Metro DC DSA, we are lucky enough to have three SURJ chapters in the region: in DC, Baltimore and Northern Virginia. The DC listserv provides a weekly calendar of events with specific requests for white allies to step up. An example of that is a call for SURJ members to sign up for training on how to do childcare for Black allies who want to attend events critical to them. Events listed include notifications from not only Black Lives Matter but other organizations doing social justice work. For example, the listserv provides notices of vigils for: Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray Tamir Rice, Natasha Mckenna, and others, as well as local workshops and conferences on racial justice issues, and actions against Walmart and for farm workers. SURJ has also initiated a series of metropolitan discussion groups for white folk to speak with other white folk about stepping up to action around racial justice.\n\nSo, where to start? In our local, we can begin by inviting our metropolitan SURJ chapters to come and tell us how we can plug into the work they are so especially equipped to undertake. Perhaps with guidance from SURJ, a democratic socialist discussion group could be initiated and/or a joint DSA/SURJ event could be planned to move us forward in \"walking the walk.\"","order":5},{"title":"Reshaping Yourself and Your Surroundings as Anti-Racist (Tips from SURJ)","date":"2016-02-02","issue":"February 2016","author":"","body":"*Compiled by Ingrid Goldstrom*\n\nSome posts on the SURJ website provide \"gentle reminders\" of what it means to do anti-racism work.

Miller","body":"Caroline O'Shea, director of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, and Diana Philip, director of NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland, spoke on January 10 at the monthly Metro-DC DSA meeting about the state of reproductive rights in Washington, DC, Virginia and Maryland. Each area has its own particular challenges to overcome to ensure that women have the right to make decisions about their own reproductive health.\n\nReproductive rights for many women in Washington, DC, for instance, are crippled by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits federal funding for abortion coverage and that prevents women on Medicaid, federal government workers, women in the military, and members of the Peace Corps from accessing affordable abortions. Virginia also severely limits women's reproductive rights by imposing waiting periods, biased counseling and insurance restrictions on abortion care. Even Maryland, often thought of as a relatively progressive state, restricts minors' ability to obtain abortions and all too often fails to provide young people with sound sexual education and access to condoms and other forms of contraception.\n\nI've [*written here previously*](http://dsadc.org/raising-class-consciousness-through-abortion-activism/) about how abortion restrictions are not merely a women's problem but largely a working women's problem. While upper-class women will always have access to abortion, whether it is legally accessible or not, many middle-class women and certainly even more working class women are facing greater difficulties in obtaining not only abortion care but reproductive healthcare in general.\n\nDespite abortion access's importance in the lives of working class women, the connection between socialism and the support for abortion rights may not be immediately obvious. However, socialist and feminist Sharon Smith, in her book *Women and Socialism: Class, Race, and Capital*, argues that women's oppression is related to the emergence of class oppression. (The book was discussed at a January Jacobin reading group meeting and is also to be discussed at a second [*DC *Jacobin* reading group Feb. 4*](http://www.meetup.com/DC-DSA/events/227725398/).) She states, \"...at the same time that men were playing an increasingly exclusive role in production, women were required to play a much more central role in reproduction.\" In other words, women's oppression is inherently linked not only to class but to women's physical ability to reproduce children.\n\nCapitalism exploits women not only as workers but also for their free labor in bearing and raising the next generation of workers. Therefore, a full range of reproductive choices for women must be part of any socialist agenda for widespread change in our society and our economic system. True reproductive freedom must include not only the right to abortion but also the right of women to bring children into the world who will be supported by their communities. Women's reproductive choices then must include not only abortion access but also a myriad of issues that affect women and their children such as state-funded daycare, a robust public education system, and universal healthcare, among others. These are all issues that socialists are already passionately supporting, but even as we champion these causes for the working class, we should not forget that they significantly impact working class women.\n\nSocialists certainly face significant challenges to implement these social supports for working mothers, and we perhaps have an even more arduous battle ahead of us to secure abortion access for *all* women, not just the wealthy few. The first step we can take is to educate ourselves about what the current landscape of reproductive rights looks like. Educating ourselves at the January 10<sup>th</sup> membership meeting was taking that first step, and I encourage my comrades to take that step even further by checking out updates from [*NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia*](http://www.naralva.org/), [*NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland*](http://www.prochoicemd.org/), the [*Guttmacher Institute*](https://www.guttmacher.org/) and other resources on reproductive rights. We might not always agree with these organizations, or particularly with NARAL's recent endorsement of Hillary Clinton, but we can stand in solidarity with their desire to see a society where women in our society have access to a full range of reproductive rights.","order":9},{"title":"Union-Community Unity Leads to Victory: 700 Safeway Jobs Saved in Prince George's County","date":"2016-02-02","issue":"February 2016","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"On January 21, members of Teamsters Local 639 and Local 731 voted to ratify a new contract for the nearly 1000 workers employed at Safeway Distribution centers in Upper Marlboro and Landover, Md. The union had to make some wage and benefit concessions, but preserved the job of every worker threatened by a permanent layoff. It was the culmination of a successful campaign that began in October when those workers were given notice that the warehouses were going to be shut down, with the work transferred to non-union facilities in Pennsylvania. Union unity, amongst Teamster members, from the Metro Washington Labor Council and its affiliated unions, and broad community support were the reasons why the jobs were won.\n\nMoreover, local elected officials in Prince George's County and state-wide in Maryland were upfront and vocal in support of the workers. There was a great deal of anger, because Safeway had been given tax breaks by the county to build new state-of-the-art facilities to keep local jobs – facilities and jobs threatened with abandonment.\n\nThat, of course, is the problem now experienced in Washington DC where Walmart, after receiving preferential treatment in order to enter the city, then decided not to open stores in the neighborhoods were jobs are most needed (see related story this issue by Bill Mosley). What is at issue here isn't one particular company, but a model of business. The conflict in Prince George's began because Safeway had entered into a business relationship with C&S Wholesale Distributors, a huge private corporation that has a history of union-busting, shutting down organized workplaces and shifting work to their non-union center in Pennsylvania. In 2011, 1,000 organized warehouse workers lost their jobs in New Jersey when C&S shut down A&P operations in the area. A&P and other regional supermarket chains have filed lawsuits against C&S because of their monopolistic practices, which lead to business shutdowns. It is a model that respects neither workers nor communities, a model that drives local businesses out of business – symptomatic of the drift of our entire economic system.\n\nThe victory just won gains extra importance because it resulted in Safeway taking back control of its warehouses from C&S in exchange for financial incentives from state and municipal leaders. The six-year agreement signed with the Teamster locals guarantees no outsourcing during the length of the contract.\n\nNonetheless, vigilance is still needed – the layoffs likely would never have been proposed in the first place had Cerberus Capital Management not purchased controlling interest in the retailer along with other grocery food chains. Symptomatic of the entire drift of neo-liberal economics, Cerberus is a hedge fund that makes money by closing thriving, profitable, companies, and reinvesting the money elsewhere to reap even bigger financial rewards. This parasitic model of corporate behavior is very much in line with the deregulation of banks, a model of the economy in which corporate profits and the production of goods and services have largely been severed.\n\nYet the preservation of the jobs shows that workers can fight back to preserve their jobs and their rights. In the words of Teamster Local 730 President Ritchie Brooks: \"The key to our victory was that everyone banded together. Labor, political leaders and the community all came together to show Safeway our solidarity.\"\n\nSources:\n\n[*http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/18520/cs\\_wholesale\\_grocers\\_safeway\\_layoffs*](http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/18520/cs_wholesale_grocers_safeway_layoffs)\n\n[***http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2011/02/1000\\_workers\\_laid\\_off\\_in\\_groce.html***](http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2011/02/1000_workers_laid_off_in_groce.html)\n\n[***http://www.dclabor.org/union-city-news***](http://www.dclabor.org/union-city-news)**: 1/22/16, 1/20/16, 11/13/15, 10/18/15**\n\n**Teamster Website: \"**Teamsters, Elected Officials, Community Leaders Tell Safeway To Keep Jobs In Maryland' 10/16/15","order":10},{"title":"Update: WHUT-TV to participate in FCC auction","date":"2016-02-02","issue":"February 2016","author":"Carolyn M. Byerly","body":"As anticipated, Howard University President Wayne Frederick announced in mid-January that the university, owner of public station WHUT-TV, would participate in the Federal Communication Commission's reverse auction. That process (also called the incentive auction) allows station licensees to sell off all or part of their access to the electromagnetic spectrum they use for broadcasting.\n\nHoward has three options – to sell all rights to its spectrum, to move the broadcast station from UHF to VHF spectrum, or to enter into a shared arrangement (partnership) with another public station. All deals are secret until finalized, which should be summer or fall 2016.\n\nThe university, which is experiencing a major fiscal challenge brought on by the Congress's sequestration of $20 million in funds to Howard, and the Howard Hospital's continuous financial losses, is looking at WHUT to bring in somewhere between $100 million and $500 million in revenues. Congress created Howard University in 1867 to educate and advance research related to African Americans, and the university has received an annual allotment from Congress in all the years since. While that allotment today makes up less than 20 percent of the university's budget, its loss at this particular time has contributed to Howard's fiscal problems.\n\nWHUT is the only African-American-owned public TV station in the US, and presently has 2 million viewers. Marketing research has shown that the African American audience is increasing for all public broadcast stations, jumping from 17% to 23% between 2011 and 2012.\n\nOur Howard Media Group has [*posted another protest and analysis*](http://www.howardmediagroup.org/news/hmg-replies-presidents-announcement-howard-will-participate-auction-12016) of the decision on our website which puts the situation into a bigger context of the communication industry under neoliberalism. Telecommunications is the second largest income-generating industry in the world (second only to the pharmaceutical industry), and those who derive those profits wield enormous economic and political power both nationally and internationally.\n\nResearch by the civil rights group Operation Push shows that representation by women and non-white individuals on boards of directors of traditional media, cable, and new media companies ranged from only7% to 30% in 2012. The matter of who has access to the channels of communication arises and who controls the policies of those companies is more than a scholarly concern for those of us who have followed the selling off of public airwaves. Who should speak for whom in a democracy also determines who has access to the public sphere, a discursive space required for democracy to function.\n\nA [*January 16 article in the *Washington Post**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/01/13/your-local-tv-station-may-have-just-secretly-decided-to-go-off-the-air/) claimed that Howard has until March to decide if it will withdraw its letter of intent, but that provision hasn't been verified by anything available on the FCC website.\n\nAs this issue of the *Washington Socialist* goes to press, members of Howard Media Group are planning to meet and discuss next steps in addressing the potential loss of this important station. These steps may include the calling of a public meeting to allow supporters of the station to air their grievances over the impending sale of WHUT. *Carolyn M. Byerly is a member of the Metro DC DSA.

There was nothing on paper, nothing legally binding that required Walmart to do anything, and once the company got the properties it wanted most, it thumbed its nose at the DC residents who supported the new Walmarts for the jobs and shopping opportunities – in lower-income, African American neighborhoods where both are scarce – that the stores would bring. The Skyland neighborhood has actually wound up in even worse condition than before, with many of its aging stores having already been demolished in anticipation of the Walmart that now will never come. At the same time, Walmart also canceled its plans for a store at Capitol Gateway, like Skyland located in the retail- and job-starved portion of the District east of the Anacostia River.\n\nFive years ago, as Walmart was gearing up for its entry into DC, Metro-DC DSA was part of the citywide \"[*Respect DC*](http://jufj.org/content/respect-dc-living-wages-healthy-communities)\" coalition demanding that Walmart meet a series of conditions if it was to come to the District, including local hiring, a living wage for employees, and protections for small businesses. These demands were based on the recognition that Walmart is no ordinary chain of big-box stores. It has become the [*world's largest corporation*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/walmart-backs-out-of-dc-deal-citing-costs-and-citys-poorest-pay-the-price/2016/01/19/af963e00-becb-11e5-9443-7074c3645405_story.html) by adopting a business model of low wages for retail workers, hostility to unions, and relentless pressure on its overseas factories to keep costs down – resulting in manufacturing workers in such countries as China, Bangladesh and Honduras working in sweatshop conditions for less than a dollar a day. It also is infamous for moving into mostly smaller communities and driving locally owned businesses to ruin with its low prices – and then, when customers have no shopping options other than Walmart, often jacking prices back up. The company's foray into DC was part of a new strategy of opening in urban markets, as the company's exploitation of suburbs and small towns began to produce diminishing returns. But in the case of Skyland, Walmart killed off local businesses even without opening a store of its own.\n\nBut in the end, Walmart's opponents in the District had little leverage to force the company to either be a good neighbor or stay away. Walmart did sign a watered-down \"community benefits agreement\" that contained no promises on wages or worker rights. The DC Council considered but failed to pass a bill that would require big-box stores such as Walmart to pay a higher-than-minimum wage, with much of the DC political establishment eager to welcome Walmart with open arms. With many of DC's lower-income neighborhoods desperate for jobs and places to shop – many residents live miles from a supermarket – Walmart appeared to offer one-stop shopping for the District's economic needs. And so with the feeble promise extracted from Gray to serve some of DC's neediest neighborhoods, Walmart proceeded with building stores near Union Station, on upper Georgia Ave. and at Fort Totten Square, the latter one opening last fall with a ribbon-cutting ceremony featuring Mayor Muriel Bowser.\n\nAfter Walmart's announced it would not build the Skyland and Capitol Gateway stores, Bowser said she was \"blood mad\" about the company's treachery. (Bowser, it must be remembered, opposed the bill to require Walmart to pay a higher wage when she was a councilmember). But the ire of DC officials is matched only by their inability to do anything about it. Walmart holds all the cards; it can pull out of communities at will, and its cancellation of the two DC stores was part of an [*announced shuttering of 154 stores nationwide, about two-thirds of which are the smaller-format Walmart Express stores, as well as over 100 stores in Latin America*](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/walmart-to-shutter-269-stores/) Only rarely has a community blocked the company from moving in, even in the face of considerable opposition. A possible silver lining is that the company's retrenchment might indicate that its business model of retail shock-and-awe with low-wage labor is running its course.\n\nPerhaps it is time for communities, including DC, to cease depending on the kindness of giant corporations for jobs and economic development. Instead, local governments should be doing more to incubate small, locally owned businesses that serve, and are responsive to, the needs of their neighborhoods. Providing aspiring local entrepreneurs with low-cost (or no-cost) loans, assistance in acquiring permits and overcoming other regulatory hurdles, and guidance in marketing themselves to the community could create businesses that keep wealth local while leading to true neighborhood revitalization.\n\nIn today's corporate-driven environment, the idea of communities taking charge of their economic development might seem utopian. But until they do, big business will be in charge, and cities and towns will have to dance to their tune.","order":12},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—February 2016 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"February 2016","order":-1,"date":"2016-02-02","body":"**Welcome to the February 2016 issue of the *Washington Socialist*, the free monthly email newsletter of the Metro DC local of Democratic Socialists of America.**\n\n\n\nIt's a pretty full issue because it has to last through February 29.

Walmart, which connived its way into the juiciest areas of the DC market with a promise to bring its stores and employment to some of the city's hardest-hit communities, has now reversed itself and canceled plans to include those (no doubt less lucrative) communities. And the city, which got none of those gaudy promises in writing, is stuck with no recourse. Bill Mosley anatomizes the Walmart betrayal.

The character has to try to find some way to break out of the loop and reach February 3, but over seemingly hundreds of successive Groundhog Days his efforts fail – until the happy ending, of course.\n\nActivism sometime seems like \"Groundhog Day,\" with the same questions and issues arising time after time which, after much debate and many proffered solutions, nothing changes. And no issue Democratic Socialists of America has faced more resembles a repetitive loop than the old question: Why are there so few persons of color in DSA?\n\nDSA hasn't conducted any recent polls or surveys on members' race or ethnicity. However, to attend nearly any DSA meeting or convention, local or national, over the organization's lifetime (back to the founding in 1982, and earlier than that in the predecessor organizations) would bear out the fact that DSA is, and has been, a nearly all-white organization (\"white\" being a notoriously slippery term, but that's a topic for another day). And for nearly as long, DSA has regularly engaged in self-flagellation over this fact. How, we ask, can we call ourselves a progressive organization, working for the benefit of the entire working class, while we have so few African-American, Latino and other minority members – the very people who would benefit most from the policies we champion?\n\nFirst, I should say that in recent years, DSA has largely moved beyond its earlier hand-wringing and acknowledged the difficulty of organizing across racial lines in this racially polarized society. It is often said that the only successful multiracial national organizations in the United States are trade unions – and these consist of workers banding together out of necessity. When one looks at other organizations on the left, DSA is about as diverse as most of them.\n\nHowever, as recently as 1992, the DSA National Board (a now-defunct body that met in the years between biennial national conventions), meeting in D.C., adopted a resolution calling for 10 percent of the organization to be composed of \"traditionally underrepresented racial, ethnic and linguistic minority groups\" by 1994. The resolution, however, was accompanied by no specific strategy to achieve this ambitious goal. I was a delegate to the Board and confess to being swept up in a wave of optimism and voting for the resolution, and then almost immediately regretting my support for such an empty gesture. (Someone – OK, it was me – quipped that we could achieve this almost overnight by convincing most of the white members to quit). Needless to say, the resolution was a spectacular failure. Later during the 1990s, a proposal circulated within DSA to achieve instant diversity by merging with the Black Radical Congress, but the idea failed to gain traction.\n\nAny attempt to achieve solidarity across racial lines swims against the tide of more than four centuries of white oppression of persons of color that have poisoned race relations in the United States — including two and one-half centuries of black slavery followed by another century of Jim Crow, as well as genocidal wars against Native Americans. Persons of color have understandably preferred to chart their own agenda rather than leave their fate in the hands of majoritarian society, and to nurture their own movements rather than consign themselves to being minorities in majority-white organizations – whose members may be well-meaning but lack an understanding of the real needs of minority communities. While some saw the election of Barack Obama as a sign that we may be the cusp of a post-racial society, the rise of the Tea Party – a movement rife with white racial resentment – indicates otherwise. And while the false charges from the far right that Obama was a closet socialist helped raise awareness of and interest in socialism and DSA, it didn't result in a noticeable boost in minority recruitment.\n\nReaching out to and recruiting Latinos involves its own challenges, the language barrier being only the most conspicuous. The transnational character and isolation of a large segment of the Latino population pose obstacles to attempts by the U.S. left to build bridges, while the same characteristics make Latinos inviting scapegoats for racists and nativists.\n\nRelations between persons of color and the U.S. socialist movement had a troubled beginning. During the early days of the U.S. Socialist Party, its leader Eugene V. Debs spoke out against racial prejudice and refused to appear before segregated audiences. However, according to Debs biographer Ray Ginger, he \"refused to concede that poor Negroes were in a worse position than poor white people\" and believed that the achievement of socialism would sweep away racial divisions. Even this was more enlightened than the views of other Socialist notables such as Victor Berger, who wrote that \"the negroes and mulattoes constitute a lower race.\" African Americans of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, faced with lynching, segregation and job discrimination, were understandably not prepared to lay aside their own pressing concerns while waiting for the socialist millennium to arrive.\n\nHowever, one socialist organization enjoyed success for a time in recruiting African Americans – the Communist Party USA. Especially during the period between the world wars, the CP made an aggressive effort to reach out to African Americans and immerse itself in their struggles. According to Fraser M. Ottanelli's history of the CP, African Americans made up some 11 percent of the organization's membership in the mid-1930s. The party's notables included leading African-American writers and intellectuals such as W.E.B DuBois, Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison. However, unlike DSA, the CP was a cadre organization – the party's leadership, taking its direction from Moscow, could simply order its members to work on priority issues. An open, democratic organization such as DSA can't do that. Of course, the CP's collapse in the early 1990s ended that experiment in multi-racial socialism.\n\nIf DSA had been founded as an explicitly multiracial organization, its history may have been different. We have to live with the legacy of Michael Harrington's founding of the DSA's predecessor organization, the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, which espoused solidarity with the struggles of minorities but included few persons of color in its leadership. DSOC and DSA were thereafter tagged as \"white\" organizations. DSA has included a number of prominent minorities – Cornel West, Dolores Huerta, Manning Marable – on its list of notable members, but their presence has had scant effect on recruitment at the grass roots.\n\nBut even with the best intentions, DSA's organizational culture poses a barrier to appealing to and recruiting minorities. People tend to seek out and stick with organizations where they feel comfortable and welcome, and that usually means those whose members have similar backgrounds and common experiences to share. DSA's culture, like it or not, is one of highly educated, talkative white people who have significant amounts of free time. Rather than obsess over the lack of African Americans and Latinos, we might take note of other groups largely absent in our membership (many of these overlapping): blue-collar workers, low-wage service workers, people without college degrees, the homeless and chronically unemployed, recent immigrants and people not fluent in English, persons with disabilities and (at least among active members) parents with young children. Within these groups are countless people who might be attracted to our politics but would probably not be comfortable with, or not have enough free time for, participating in our meetings and activities. In addition – and this is an important topic for discussion in itself — women are woefully underrepresented among DSA activists and leadership; for example, approximately three-fourths of the delegates to last year's DSA convention were men. Many women in DSA have cited the \"maleness\" of the organization's culture as a reason they're not more active.\n\nSo where do we go from here? I don't have all the answers, nor does anyone else. But I can suggest a few places to start. First, let's make sure we don't fall back into our habits from the 1990s of setting unrealistic diversity goals and then beating ourselves up when we don't achieve them. Let's build an organization we can be proud of, not one to berate for not being perfect.\n\nNevertheless, we should continue looking for ways to engage communities of color in a constructive and fraternal way – not because we want to pirate their members or tell them what to do, but out of genuine interest in their causes. We should focus on issues that are of concern to minority communities – poverty, immigration, criminal-justice reform, health care, jobs – and seek out organizations rooted in minority communities to work in partnership with them. Minority activists have learned to sniff out condescending and know-it-all whites from a mile away – so to make this work we have to make it clear that we're in it to help, not give orders. Unlike the CP, DSA can't simply order its members to drop everything and work on campaigns of the organization's choosing; we'll need to get our members' buy-in and interest and not ask them to step too far out of their comfort zones, at least at first. Helping resolve gang disputes may be too daunting a project, but walking a picket line with janitors is just our speed. Our aim must be to show that we're serious and reliable partners with grassroots communities. We don't want to be heavy-handed in pushing DSA's line or collaring people into joining the organization (which we generally don't do anyway) – but if DSA is seen as important and relevant enough to these struggles, recruitment will be easier and more natural.\n\nTransforming DSA into a broad, majoritarian, multi-racial organization should be the aspiration of all of our members. However, the road to that goal may need to be traveled in small steps. But if we start now, we can put another Groundhog Day debate behind us and help bring about DSA's flowering as a more diverse organization.","order":0},{"title":"Film, Panel on Worker Coops Gets Buzz","date":"2013-01-31","issue":"February 2013","author":"Jose Gutierrez","body":"\"Shift Change\" was shown on December 17<sup>th</sup> in the Gompers Room of the AFL-CIO building in Washington DC. I found it to be an enormously inspiring movie.\n\n\"Shift Change\" shares the stories of the many employee-owned businesses that successfully compete in today's economy. These companies are special in that they provide secure, dignified jobs in democratic workplaces. As a result of the current economic crisis, citizens and public officials are ready to look for new solutions. Workers and managers alike strive to reinvent our failing economy and to restore employment in a more egalitarian way.\n\nBefore the movie was shown, a panel discussed the potential of cooperatives. The members of the panel included Leo Gerard, from United Steelworkers Union; David Madland, from the Center for American Progress; Liz Bailey, from the Cooperative Development Foundation; Gar Alperovitz, from the Democracy Collaborative, and John Cavanagh, from the Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nThe first speaker was Leo Gerard. Gerard championed unions and coops as natural partners. He cast the Mondragon company in the Basque province of Spain as a useful model. He averred that all cooperatives train their workers and pay them well. In Canada, the union movement had tried to increase employee ownership. However, they were harshly criticized by many members of the Canadian left for working with the business bosses. He added: \"My father was a socialist. I'm a socialist. My father said that it was important for workers to own the means of production.\" In the course of his presentation he stated: \"No one would give us money. We sold our shares and we lost control. This (the creation of American cooperatives that are modeled after Mondragon) is the next step.\"\n\nIn cooperatives workers do not feel threatened by higher productivity. Gerard recommends that Steelworker coops through out this country be closely modeled on the Mondragon coops. He stresses that we should not rush this conversion and in this way cause it to fail.\n\nDavid Madland of the Center for American Progress argued that Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) companies, profit sharing, and cooperatives are all part of a type of \"inclusive capitalism.\"\n\nCompanies like these provide higher wages to their workers. They are all about building a better type of capitalism. Organizations of this variety have had a good track record in the US. There is potential for bipartisan support for such efforts. Ronald Reagan called these types of enterprises \"people's capitalism.\"\n\nLiz Bailey of the Cooperative Development Foundation informed the audience that CDF members are raising funds for cooperatives in New Orleans and New York City. NOLA Coops helped displaced residents in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The CDF has also organized participants in \"welfare to work\" programs into coops. She concurred that coop workers get better training and are paid better, adding that they are on a professional track. She also spoke briefly about how the Affordable Care Act promotes home care and how this could be a great opportunity to organize new workers into coops.\n\nJohn Cavanagh of the Institute for Policy Studies stated that cooperatives could be the cornerstone of a new economy.\n\nGar Alperovitz, Democracy Collaborative (and a professor at the University of Maryland) said that there is a development process driven\nby pain and failure leading to something new. Cooperatives are part of a\nhistorical process that might lead to a new political movement. \"This is not a new type of capitalism or socialism, it's something new.\"\n\n**Some projects featured in the film:**\n\n*Mondragon Cooperative*: Begun in the 1950s, the Mondragon co-ops have transformed a depressed area of Spain into one of the most productive in Europe with a high standard of living and an egalitarian way of life. These co-ops produce computer chips, high tech industrial machinery, household appliances, and many other products. They are owned and managed by their workers. Seeing the achievements of Mondragon helps to overcome the idea—widespread in North America—that worker run cooperatives can only exist on the economic fringe.\n\n*The Evergreen Cooperatives* in Cleveland, Ohio: This is an ambitious urban redevelopment model, directly inspired by Mondragon, where local institutions and public officials are supporting green cooperatives of previously marginalized, predominantly African American workers, who provide commercial laundry services, install solar energy systems, and grow vegetables in vast urban greenhouses.\n\n*Arizmendi Association of Cooperatives*: Started 30 years ago, there are now six of these independent worker owned and managed cooperative bakeries in Northern California, concentrated around San Francisco, that work together to provide the financial and legal services they need, and to incubate new coop bakeries.\n\n*Cooperatives of immigrant workers*: Often the most marginalized in our current economic system, immigrant workers are starting cooperatives to create secure, environmentally friendly jobs. The non-profit WAGES helps low income women, largely Latina immigrants, organize green house-cleaning cooperatives in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\n*Isthmus Engineering and Manufacturing* in Madison, Wisconsin: This proudly worker owned and managed company designs and builds custom high tech manufacturing equipment for the medical, automotive and energy industries. They have a strong commitment to improving solar technologies. They've joined with other longstanding coops in Madison, including Union Cab and Community Pharmacy, plus many others, to form a network of worker cooperatives that can support each other and encourage new cooperative businesses to form.\n\nCooperatives are an example of democracy in the workplace that democratic socialists can support but that can also appeal to moderates and even conservatives.\n\n**Further:** A website where you can purchase the movie: [*http://www.bullfrogfilms.com/catalog/shift.html*](http://www.bullfrogfilms.com/catalog/shift.html) ; A Facebook page with visual info: [*http://www.facebook.com/shiftchangemovie*](http://www.facebook.com/shiftchangemovie)\n\n[*Jobs and environment top progressive agenda in Md. Assembly*](http://dsadc.org/jobs-and-environment-top-progressive-agenda-in-maryland-assembly/)\n\n***The Washington Socialist*&lt;&gt;February 2013**\n\n*By Woody Woodruff*\n\nMaryland's economic prospects are looking up, somewhat, and at least for now, the General Assembly session is looking sunnier too.\n\nGov. Martin O'Malley's budget, submitted to the legislature a few days after the Jan. 17 opening of the three-month session, seeks no major cuts of the sort that made previous sessions so painful and adds some sweeteners to programs favored by progressives.\n\nEven the retrograde, tax-averse Senate President Mike Miller has turned some kind of corner at age 70, promising that after two failed attempts, a state-driven offshore wind project will get through the Senate, and proposing an overlaid sales tax on gasoline to fund transportation projects.\n\nProgressive legislators and their organizational allies rate many other critical projects favorably or at least with a fighting chance, including a clean water and pesticide disclosure package, a fully financed study of hydraulic fracturing, death penalty repeal and – more a long shot – an increase in the state minimum wage.\n\nBut a lot can go wrong in three months, as progressives have found to their dismay in the past. As with many legislatures, the Assembly has a history of taking two or three tries to pass even the most attractive and well-supported bills. And the legislators can't increase the governor's budget, but they can make cuts and move money around among the line items.\n\nAnd best-laid plans may be ruffled by a new, large gun control initiative by O'Malley driven by reaction to the massacre of elementary school children and their teachers at Newtown, Conn. The package of new gun control regulations, including an assault weapons ban, is high on the public agenda but also the kind of high-conflict issue that could hog a lot of the oxygen at the session.\n\nThe [*National Association Education of Maryland*](http://www.marylandeducators.org/detail.aspx?id=4594), which represents the bulk of the state's teachers, is gearing up to defend and if possible augment a respectable budget level of \"Thornton\" funding for schools, somewhat equalizing the disparity between high-income counties like Montgomery and Howard counties and low-income systems like Prince George's County and Baltimore City. Alvin Thornton, a Prince George's school board member and chair, led a state-appointed panel that in 1999 created a formula and framework for equalizing school resources around the state.\n\nMaryland is still emerging from tough times in the public sphere and private business. Maryland unions, who according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics lost 30,000 union jobs between 2011 and 2012, are working separate paths during the session to hold or increase jobs, insiders say. Construction unions in a welcome alliance with green forces continue to back the offshore wind project, with its promise of 15,000 jobs over 20 years. The O'Malley budget offers minority small business sweeteners in this latest offshore wind version that should keep traditional allies together on the project, and proponents argue that the state can become a hub of turbine technology research and manufacture as well.\n\nAdditional transportation money, for roads and transit, may make Miller's notion of a sales tax on motor fuel attractive; the fight then will be between new-road advocates and transit buffs. The bad taste left by the Inter-County Connector, a hugely expensive and underutilized toll road from Montgomery to Prince George's, could tip sentiments toward transit and the Purple Line. The ICC single-handedly maxed out Maryland's bond capacity and environmentalists see it as a stealth segment of an Outer Beltway that would confirm the region as the gridlock capital of the Western world. The long-planned Purple Line light rail from Silver Spring to New Carrollton, also a job-generator, benefits from the shadow the ICC throws on big new road projects.\n\nMiller's plan for adding an overlay sales tax to gasoline sales wasn't to be released until around Feb. 1, though Lou Davis of the MPT program \"State Circle\" joked Jan. 25 that \"he's been leaking it all week.\" It appears to have a regional structure, with counties permitted to apply the tax for their transportation projects as well as a state cut. Miller's considerable clout will be tested; the other two major players, O'Malley and House Speaker Michael Busch, appear to be keeping their powder dry.\n\nEnvironmentalists consider the [*offshore wind bill*](http://www.marylandoffshorewind.org/) a top priority as well, but feel more confident about its chances now that one of the principal roadblocks, Sen. Anthony Muse of Prince George's, has unceremoniously been shifted out of the Senate Finance Committee to another spot. His replacement, Prince George's Sen. Victor Ramirez, is a committed friend of the offshore wind bill, which failed to get out of the Finance Committee last year on the hectic final day of the session. Again, Miller – who took some heat for the Senate's role in the fiasco – swapped Muse for Ramirez unilaterally and guaranteed the offshore wind bill would get to the floor this session.\n\nThe green forces also back a package that would require full reporting of pesticide use by agriculture. The state [*League of Conservation Voters*](http://www.mdlcv.org/issues) describes it as \"a simple and cost-neutral,centralized online pesticide reporting database paid for by a modest fee increase for chemicalmanufacturers.\"\n\nEnvironmentalists also hope to pass a \"bag bill\" at either state or county level. Bills allowing a five-cent county-level fee on plastic bags – a huge source of litter – have been introduced covering both the state and just Prince George's County. The county bill would allow the county council to pass the bag-fee legislation, something it can't do without a legislative OK. The state bill would enable all counties to do the same. Prince George's is flanked by jurisdictions – Montgomery County and the District – where the bag fee is already in place with demonstrably good results, visible to the public eye.\n\nMaryland has a moratorium in place on [*hydraulic fracturing*](http://maryland.sierraclub.org/action/p0319.asp), the method of extracting natural gas from shale formations that has roiled Pennsylvania and New York state. Impoverished Western Maryland lies over a portion of the vast Marcellus Shale rimming the eastern piedmont and homeowners want to sell drilling rights – but evidence is strong that the method, which involves pumping toxic liquids into the deep shale, threatens ground water supplies and aquifers as it has been practiced.\n\nThe moratorium will remain in place until a study required by a law sponsored by Montgomery Del. Heather Mizeur is completed, and because the study was never funded it was feared pressure from drillers and property owners in the western counties would remove the constraint.\n\nBut Mizeur told activists at a Greenbelt Climate Action Network meeting in mid-January that the governor's budget, to be released the next day, would contain full funding for a real analysis of the risks. That funding, too, has to be defended during the session.\n\nThe state [*Green Party*](http://www.marylandgreenparty.org/2012/12/weve-introduced-our-2013-legislative.html) is backing offshore wind, death penalty repeal and an effort to restrict corporate spending on elections in the state, reversing (at least for Maryland) some of the worst effects of the Citizens United decision on campaign financing by \"Prohibiting business entities from making contributions to a campaign finance entity to support or oppose a candidate.\"\n\nAdmirably, the Green Party is also backing the creation of a Maryland state bank that would be the depository for all state tax and fee revenue, on the model of the 91-year-old state bank of North Dakota. Bills providing for that bank were filed last year, but failed.\n\nThe Green Party, perennially under the threat of losing its ballot line, must generate 10,000 valid petition signatures in each election cycle; they propose lowering that to 5,000 because \"third party candidates \\[are forced\\] to spend most of their resources on ballot access instead of campaigning.\" Sen. Paul Pinsky, a progressive Democrat from Prince George's, has frequently filed similar ballot access bills but the interest of the Democratic majority does not appear to align with such notions.\n\nAnd at the level of real poverty, legislators are proposing an increase in the state's minimum wage, which has been at the federal level of $7.25 an hour for years.

We want to be inclusive in our political work at every level including membership. But too often we do carry out our good intentions within the realities of our white (and gendered) identities . . . perhaps.\n\nFor me, moving outside my own white, female experience has started with opening space in my head and shifting the ways I get politically involved. I've had some great teachers, and some awkward (even painful) moments trying to do this. Thus, I can share a few personal lessons about \"white\" organizations. These are essentially to:\n\n1) Embrace what many African American radicals have taught me through the years: \"Work on racism in your own \\[meaning my\\] communities.\"\n\n2) Stop trying to bring people of color into my organizations; instead, join theirs with the intention of staying and working through their leadership. (p.s., This doesn't mean to stop outreach or to be welcoming in our own groups, just to diversify our own strategies.)\n\n3) Find ways to build coalitions across organizations either on an issue basis, or an ongoing basis – this echoes Bill's article in one aspect, allowing white majority groups to work with civil rights and other minority majority groups in common purpose.\n\n4) Read more black and Latino writers with a left political conscience, both women and men.\n\n5) Spend more social time in the company of people from other races and ethnicities. Develop greater ease with their cultures and explore friendships where possible.\n\nBill's article also mentioned the often-touted accusation that DSA lacks female members, citing its male culture. This is something that resonates with my own experience, not only in DSA but other left organizations and, frankly, in general in this society. Good men do not mean to be exclusionary or sexist – they seem to become both because they \"live\" in a male-centered head space. Everything around us affirms and reinforces this.\n\nLess discussed these days is how leftist men participate.\n\nFor example, I am regularly struck by some of my favorite white leftist intellectuals who assume that their analysis of social institutions \"works\" for women (and also people of color) the same way it does for men. One example is related to communication policies, something I've studied and worked to change for a number of years. The male scholars and political analysts who write most of the books on concentration of ownership and the public policies that enable it fail to acknowledge the impact of conglomeration on women and racial minorities. They espouse a \"one analysis fits all\" philosophy.\n\nOne reason this happens is because even smart, left-leaning men I know don't read books or articles by women. My own feminist scholarship is rarely cited by my male academic colleagues, even though we meet up at conferences and talk about the same concerns. It just doesn't occur to them that I (or other feminist media scholars) have anything to offer them. When a Canadian Marxist colleague contacted me about five years ago to ask me to suggest some of my articles on media ownership and women's employment, I was pleasantly surprised. He has started citing my (and other feminists') work now, which brings gender into his own research in ways it was previously missing.\n\nThese are breakthroughs that matter.\n\nBut let me add an illustration of how women also become marginalized across racial lines. In the course of drafting this short commentary, I received an email announcing the \"African American Economic Summit\" to focus on needed policies in Obama's second term. The event, to be held February 1 and sponsored by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, is to be hosted by my own campus, Howard University. The announcement lists about 10 \"distinguished scholars and policy experts\" from Duke, Howard, and a range of think tanks, only one of whom is a woman. I have contacted the event's sponsor and organizers and learned that some half dozen women are scheduled to be on various panels at the Summit, but they are all but invisible in the advance publicity. Did the male speakers have more perceived value for attracting attendees in the organizers' minds?\n\nThese slights aside, we are wise to see that this is a historical moment with an opportunity to mobilize a new-New Left, and I believe that this can only happen if women and people of color are all involved.\n\nI have chosen to do make a portion of my contribution to expanding and building DSA, but it's not the only venue where I exercise my activist spirit. Wherever we choose to work, I think we need to keep talking openly about race and gender, doing what one of my favorite writers, Paul Gilroy, calls \"saying some things that are messy and disagreeable\" in the process.\n\n[*The Local Gets Busy: Looking Back on 2012*](http://dsadc.org/the-local-gets-busy-looking-back-on-2012/)\n\nWednesday, January 16th, 2013\n\nAt the risk of sounding like every other 'we did a lot give us money and volunteer' email I got at the end of the year; I'm happy to report that the DC DSA local really did accomplish a lot in 2012.

I might have raised an eyebrow.\n\nIf you then went on to tell me that we would increase the DC DSA presence in many local progressive campaigns like[*Occupy DC*](http://occupydc.org/about/background), [*Dignity at Darden*](http://www.dignityatdarden.org/), [*Our Walmart*](http://forrespect.org/), and[*Stop the TPP*](https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp) and several others; I would probably have laughed.\n\nIf you continued onward – despite my social cues indicating not to – and said that we would also coordinate and run a big [*GET UP training*](http://files.meetup.com/1580690/Get%20Up%20Brochure%20Petitioning_2012.07.11.pdf), a training explaining the causes andsolutionsto the economic crisis for progressive activists;\n\nand that we would go on to observe the[*50thAnniversaryof the Other America*](http://guevents.georgetown.edu/event/50_years_after_michael_harringtons_the_other_america_where_is_the_war_on_poverty)with a movie showing and expert panel, as well as campaign for Democrats we had mixed feelings about, I would have told you to lay off the paint thinner.\n\nBut the truth is we really did do all of that, and more. So yes, the truth is stranger than fiction.\n\nBut as socialists we know that there is always opportunity for progress.

Several DSA writers tackled that theme as applied to our organization's decades-long struggle to emerge from the classic white-male dominance that has plagued many organizations, not all of them left. But left organizations have diversity in their declared DNA, so our failure in the broad left is particularly galling. How can DSA express its diversity DNA better? See below.\n\n**Beyond Groundhog Day:** *Bill Mosley*, a DSA member since the 1980s, reviews the national and local efforts to broaden the organization's membership and reach. Could the success of the one leftist organization that had success in recruiting minority members – the Communist Party of the 1930s and '40s – be duplicated in a more \"open, democratic\" and less top-down organization like DSA? Mosley points out that our lack of minority members masks a parallel non-diversity of class, of working families in a DSA of mostly college-educated members, comparatively few of whom are raising or schooling children. Could that be the problem we should address in order to tackle our diversity problem? How much of the roadblock is our own organizational culture and social practices?

Metro DC-DSA steering committee member *Carolyn Byerly* explores that other \"groundhog day\" in greater depth, and details the way that DSA's organizational culture during her decades of membership has remained, in many ways, unwelcoming to women and male in style and process. The good news, if that's what to call it, is that DSA is not alone on the left in this. The bad news is that we exist in a wide left culture and absorb our social practices from our surroundings. And the \"head space\" that excludes not only women but feminist perspectives is also deeply entrenched in the academic and intellectual spheres from which we draw much of our ongoing, evolving analysis. We have, Byerly says, much work to do.

Worker-owned cooperatives are mounting a challenge to this condition, and making a stand in a variety of locations in and out of the US. DC-DSA Co-chair *Jose Gutierrez* relates how these examples are growing, portrayed in a recent film, \"Shift Change.\" A recent showing at the AFL-CIO headquarters in D.C. included a panel of commentators. Leo Gerard of the United Steel Workers noted that in cooperatives, workers do not feel threatened by higher productivity because it doesn't get raked off by management. They are management.

This year, and with a new Congress, the District government is pushing back with a ballot measure that would end Congress' control over D.C. budgeting. As *Bill Mosley* recounts, the measure, on the special election ballot April 23, removes the DC government budget from the congressional appropriations process. Observers say it marks a change from a conciliatory approach toward Congress to a more confrontational one. Advocates of full statehood worry that the measure is a distraction, but its proponents say it dares Congress to vote against democracy.

We fight for equality, justice, and sanity. But speaking volumes louder than any megaphone is the influence of the powerful and the wealthy on our politicians. Our voices have increasingly been drowned out by these inequalities in influence.\n\nWe are faced with a seemingly insurmountable situation. Politicians have little incentive to challenge their source of campaign cash, the news media is faced with similar incentives, and regular citizens can't afford to produce or run advertisements.\n\nFavorably, as events from Tahrir Square to the re-election of Barack Obama have shown, the Internet can be a powerful tool to leverage grassroots advantages in the face of concentrated wealth and power.\n\nStill, Americans get the vast majority of their entertainment from television. Many get almost all of their political knowledge from ads and news on TV. The trick then, is to turn these online advantages into on-screen messages.\n\n[*Loud Sauce*](https://loudsauce.com/) is an innovative startup company which provides a platform for [*crowd-funded*](http://blogs.aljazeera.com/blog/americas/crowdfunding-future-marketing) issue-ads, an incredible development which would have only been pipe-dreams a couple years ago. From the web-based platform, individuals can see the ad for free, share easily with their friends across social media, and pledge to the campaign.\n\nImportantly, the pledge is not equivalent to a donation. Like [*Kickstarter*](http://www.kickstarter.com/), another crowd-funding platform, those pledges will only be drawn upon in the event that the project meets its fundraising goal, so no one throws money at a project that will never happen. None of the risk and all of the reward.\n\nIt is with all this in mind that a friend and I created a political issue ad. Think of it as an experiment in Democracy. The logic of collective action, in a world of declining unionism, applied to advertising. Can two regular American citizens, with the support of hundreds of others, get the same kind of influence as a corporation, billionaire, or bank who can afford to run advertisements?\n\nIncredibly, this may be a first. This may be a proof-of-concept for the idea of grassroots-funded political ads, a game-changer. In this democratic effort, the process is the experiment and the message important and timely.\n\nThe fiscal cliff is looming, and our critical social safety-net programs are being threatened in negotiations by both Republicans and Democrats. In a scramble to balance the budget, Congress is likely to leave those without the money and influence to hire lobbyists behind. This means the underrepresented: minority, poor, and working-class Americans who are already experiencing the brunt of The Great Recession will be stripped of the meager social support that the state currently offers them.\n\nAs Americans we all share an interest in our common values: being our brother's keeper, expressing our political voice, sharing our scarce resources without waste, and humanity in the most general sense. Our budget is way out of whack with these values. We currently waste trillions on useless and ineffective weapon contracts like the J-35 fighter and this spending comes at a cost, not just over $500 million per jet, but over 2.2 million that could have been fed, or over 652,000 that could have been housed for a year. This is the message we hope to inspire with – that humanity needs to be a budget priority.\n\nAs Democratic Socialists we know that we win and lose not as individuals but as a society and as a nation, that we are always judged by the least well-off among us. For moral and spiritual reasons, Dr. King stressed the need to alter our course. For moral and practical reasons, President (and former-General) Eisenhower stressed the need to restrain wasteful military spending.\n\nFor all of these reasons and more, we must make sure that the 99% has their voice heard in the budget negotiations. It's time to change the national political conversation around our budget priorities: Humanity, not warships. This grassroots advertising experiment is one giant leap for the cause.\n\n*Be a part of this grassroots democracy experiment!* [**Donate $5, $10, or whatever you can and share with your friends.

The Tricky Corporate Magic of Public-Private Partnerships","date":"2014-07-13","issue":"June 2014","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"To political cynics, it may seem like the classic demonstration of the surprising but well-known tendency, under some circumstances, of powerless people who are being abused to look to their victimizers for salvation, especially when no other help seems available. To some of the rest of us, it might be simpler to think of it as just a rational response to armed robbery. In any case, the facts seem clear.\n\nFor decades now, free-market or \"neoliberal\" ideologues opposed to Big Government have been working to make social democracy unaffordable in the U.S. by slashing government revenues and increasing government debts. At the urging of free market fundamentalists and corporate lobbyists alike, politicians from both major parties have cut taxes for corporations and the rich, committed the government to trillions of dollars of legal liability to bail out failing capitalist banks and large capitalist automobile companies, allowed George Bush and Dick Cheney to launch a costly and badly bungled invasion of Iraq, and supported Pentagon budgets even larger and padded with pork than those the Pentagon claims to need.\n\nThanks to corporate-backed efforts to increase the government's expenses while reducing its revenues, many state, federal and local agencies funding the nation's infrastructure requirements and meeting the needs of the jobless and the economically insecure now are on the chopping block. The U.S. government itself is roughly $17 trillion in debt, and under a budget deal reached between the Obama administration and hostile House Republicans, most federal agencies face the threat of \"sequestration\" cuts for years to come. So how are some of our political leaders proposing to save endangered programs from chronic government budget crisis? By funding them in the future through \"public-private partnerships\" – through agreements to turn over essential public functions to the same capitalist private sector that has worked so hard to create a government budget crisis in the first place.\n\nPublic-private partnerships (sometimes abbreviated as P3s, or as PPPs) have become increasingly popular in recent years, as writer Darwin Bondgraham reported recently in the leftwing economics journal *Dollars & Sense.* When his article on P3s as \"highway robbery\" appeared in late 2012, at least 30 state legislatures around the country had passed laws specifically designed to facilitate P3 or PPP deals. But judging from a visit this year to the web site of the libertarian Reason Foundation (a major promoter of PPPs), the number of states favorable to these alternate financing arrangements has now grown to 33. Some financially stressed local governments, and D.C. region governments, have begun [*turning to P3 financing as well. *](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-07-02/features/bs-md-offshore-wind-auction-20140702_1_offshore-wind-project-turbines-cape-wind)\n\nVirginia has become a significant user of P3 or PPP financing to fund new infrastructure projects, and the District of Columbia may soon be joining the trend. Last December, Council members Muriel Bowser and David Grosso jointly introduced a \"Public Private Partnership Act of 2013\" to establish a separate agency within D.C. government with extensive powers to review proposed P3 projects and negotiate deals with developers, albeit with some oversight from the elected Council.\n\nJudging from recent comments at a June 24 panel discussion on long-term unemployment called by DSA ally Rep. John Conyers, the Obama administration also is apparently looking to P3s in some form to promote new private sector job creation. The progressive nonprofit organization the National Employment Law Center is doing so as well ([*see related story*](http://dsadc.org/panel-new-bills-raise-hope-for-relief-for-millions-of-long-term-unemployed/), this issue of the *Washington Socialist).*\n\nSimilarly, in an April discussion of the nation's unfunded infrastructure needs on the liberal *Diane Rehm Show,* Rehm's guests essentially agreed that P3s offer the only realistic option for whittling the huge U.S. infrastructure backlog down to size. (For a transcript, see [*http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2014-04-29/aging-infrastructure-and-need-new-era-transportation-policy/transcript*](http://thedianerehmshow.org/shows/2014-04-29/aging-infrastructure-and-need-new-era-transportation-policy/transcript).)\n\nIn the District, where Muriel Bowser is currently the Democratic candidate for mayor, Bowser has said that she wants her P3 bill passed to \"provide security to private investors\" so they will plow more money into Washington-area development. Bowser has indicated on previous occasions that she sees P3s as an essential tool in tackling homelessness in the District, and for meeting other social needs as well, such as aging schools, new public transit construction and water infrastructure funding.\n\nAs her office put it in a press release last December, \"This city's needs are growing at a rate that we can't sustain with our constrained capital budget and unpredictable federal funding ... Cities and states across the country and world have been using P3s for years. Now it's the District's turn. We'll use this funding tool in a smart, responsible way, take some of the politics and dysfunction out of procurement, and make the private sector work with us to build critical infrastructure.\"\n\nOther P3 advocates may not be as focused on the alleged social benefits of this alternative financial mechanism as Bowser is, however. They undoubtedly have private interests in mind. As Bondgraham reported in his *Dollars & Sense* article, \"The handful of global construction companies, investment banks, and private equity firms that dominate the P3 market today spend millions each year lobbying lawmakers in key U.S. states.\" These business lobbying groups are proposing to use P3s not just to finance highway infrastructure projects, but also \"expanding into the privatization of public building projects (like court buildings), parking garages and metering systems, and other so-called 'social infrastructure.'\".\n\nThe highly conservative and corporate-funded American Legislative Exchange Council or ALEC has drawn up a model state P3 law, Bondgraham notes, although the Reason Foundation has been more active than ALEC in promoting this concept. Clearly, both the libertarian intellectuals and the major corporations involved in existing P3 deals are looking to this form of financing as a source of private profit.\n\nAs Bondgraham indicates, many right wingers also see P3 financing as a form of privatization, and thus as advancing a libertarian agenda. On the Reason Foundation web site, for example, yearly reports on the progress of P3 legislation are included in larger reports on state and local privatization efforts.\n\net at the same time, it seems likely that the Obama White House and Council member Bowser also are sincerely interested in seeing P3s used for public purposes, notably including new job creation. Is this a rare occasion on which the interests of conservatives and progressives neatly converge, and corporate investors and left wing advocates for the dispossessed can find a common cause in marrying the capitalist profit motive to the public good? Or in this particular marriage of the profit motive to the public interest, will one of the partners inevitably end up being abused?\n\nThe issue is becoming an urgently important one nationwide, given the growth of government deficits and the size of unmet infrastructure and social spending needs. Yet so far, it seems to be flying beneath the public's radar screen.\n\nWorryingly, many political progressives seem to have been ignoring both the potentially positive and potentially negative implications of P3s for years now, as we have focused on other, seemingly more urgent issues ranging from the minimum wage to war in Iraq. Meanwhile the Reason Foundation and ALEC have been shaping proposed P3 laws to their liking. Therefore relatively few Americans on the left today seem to have anything but a superficial knowledge of what proposed P3 deals might signify.\n\nFor most DSA members, it's probably safe to say that P3s in many ways represent the very opposite of the \"socialist\" or even mildly social-democratic reforms we hope to see adopted in this country. P3s are being promoted by activists on the right, during the same era in which Republicans are trying to dismantle or at least hamstring the U.S. Postal Service and get many of its unionized employees fired. Praise for P3s is being voiced by some of the same people who are trying to privatize state prisons, public university facilities and public schools, not to mention supporting Pentagon \"outsourcing\" to the private sector of military support functions once performed by members of the U.S. Armed Services.\n\nIn terms of ideological debate, the rhetoric of \"public private partnerships\" appears to be a continuation of a corporate crusade against government social programs that has been underway since the mid-1970s, at the least, and that progressive historian Kim Phillips-Fein traces back to the elitist revolt against Roosevelt's New Deal in the 1930s. In the words of Marxist geographer David Harvey, author of *The Enigma of Capital,* corporate enthusiasm for P3s can probably be thought of in terms of a stagnant global capitalism trying to find new investment outlets through new assaults on the \"commons.\"\n\nIn a more pragmatic, short-term sense, what about the costs of P3s to the taxpayer? On a purely economic level, *Dollars & Sense* reports, P3 projects initially appear to save the public money, since they reduce or eliminate the need for state, local and federal units of government to fund large capital investment projects directly, though increased taxation or borrowing on private bond markets. However, the total lifetime costs of projects financed through P3s, as opposed to the more traditional \"design-bid\" process, are generally larger.\n\nThis is partly because when a large investment bank finances a P3 through borrowing on the private market, its interest rates are often higher than a government agency with a good credit rating might pay, Bondgraham notes. The added interest costs ultimately get passed through to the public, either in the form of taxpayer support for the P3 partners, or through higher tolls and user fees on the project, or both.\n\nAlso, large P3 projects are often bid as package deals, and in a successful bid, the private companies involved might agree to do work on the later stages of a big project without putting the work out for competitive bidding. This streamlines getting the project completed, but may result in the public paying a higher overall price than a competitive bidding process would generate.\n\nPrivate companies that enter into P3 arrangements pay the upfront costs of, say, large scale infrastructure construction, but they recoup their expenses by charging tolls to infrastructure users. In some cases where revenues from tolls have proven inadequate to meet the P3 companies' profit goals, fine-print contract clauses have required taxpayers to make up the difference through so-called \"availability payments,\" which boost the projected costs of a project overall. And in a few cases, Bondgraham reports, governments have bought back failed P3 projects from private partners under the threat of lawsuits – facing taxpayers with yet another unexpected expense.\n\nSome genuine cost savings that private companies involved in P3s have been able to achieve have come at the cost of construction workers, Bondgraham adds, since P3 developers sometimes can avoid paying union wages on construction projects where public agencies would need to follow the rules of the federal Davis-Bacon Act.\n\nAll these are excellent reasons for democratic socialists and other progressives to look on proposed P3 laws and proposed P3 projects with skepticism, to say the least. But in fairness to DC Council member Bowser and the economic planners of the Obama administration, the enormous public needs that they are apparently hoping to finance by enlisting private corporations in the process are real, and indeed are urgently pressing. It is understandable that some generally progressive politicians, along with others who may be a bit more conservative and wedded to capitalism at all costs, may feel an urge to meet these needs \"by any means necessary,\" to quote Malcolm X out of context.\n\nDSA and some other progressive groups – notably the National Nurses Association and other advocates of the so-called \"Robin Hood Tax\"– have long advocated the financing of government job-creation programs through a small financial transaction tax (FTT) on Wall Street speculators. This is one key reason, among others, why DSA supports Rep. Conyer's H.R. 1000, the proposed \"Humphrey Hawkins Full Employment and Training Act,\" which would raise hundreds of billions in added government revenues through a small FTT, then employ the money to fund public job creation by financially strapped municipalities and states.\n\nBut if progressives can't get the Conyers bill or comparable legislation through Congress, should we collectively surrender to the PPP seduction? If no other help for the poor and unemployed is available, if there is no other likely way to fix the aging infrastructure of the United States, do we need to acquiesce in the private sector controlling a growing portion of the public sector through higher cost P3s — and at the cost, it appears, of making a social democratic safety net increasingly hard to achieve in this country? To answer this question, democratic socialists need a remedial crash course on P3s, and soon.\n\n[*Briefs: Virginia elections, trade pact protest, web lobbying*](http://dsadc.org/briefs-virginia-elections-trade-pact-protest-web-lobbying/)\n\nSunday, July 13th, 2014","order":0},{"title":"Protest Against Fast Track Trade Treaties","date":"2014-07-15","issue":"June 2014","author":"","body":"The Sierra Club, Communications Workers of America, Moveon.org, European activists, National Family Farm Coalition, and others demonstrated against the potential damage of fast-tracking dangerous trade deals (5/21/2014).

The House leadership gave the 48<sup>th</sup> District less than a week to organize the primary, which was won by Richard \"Rip\" Sullivan. The vote was held in a caucus with the new provision of using Instant Runoff Voting that had been adopted by Arlington and Fairfax Democrats in the last year.\n\nInstant runoff voting is a method for ranking candidates in case no candidate gets over 50% of the vote. Each voter ranks all or some of the candidates (1<sup>st</sup> choice, 2<sup>nd</sup> choice, and onward). The candidate with the least votes is dropped and the sums are recalculated until a majority winner is found. See this link for more details [*http://www.fairvote.org/reforms/instant-runoff-voting/how-instant-runoff-voting-works/*](http://www.fairvote.org/reforms/instant-runoff-voting/how-instant-runoff-voting-works/) This form of voting ensures majority rule but eliminates old caucus methods where voting proceeds long into the night.\n\nOn July 5, a candidate debate was organized and six of the seven candidates characterized themselves as progressives. The seventh characterized herself as a liberal centrist and received the least votes in the primary. The most contentious difference concerned the effort to build a streetcar line in South Arlington. Many are concerned about the possible increase in the cost of living and short-term costs. Another issue could be the increasing lack of affordable housing. Although some candidates were open to public private partnerships, others were concerned that such partnerships are used to privatize government and turn local government into a private profit center.\n\nThe special election for the 48<sup>th</sup> District of Virginia's House will be August 19, 2014. Sullivan and Republican David Foster will vie for delegate in this heavily Democratic district.

Tenants Advocacy Coalition. The District's existing rent-control law is badly broken, housing costs are soaring to levels that many Washingtonians can't afford, and many low-income people are being pushed out of the city.\n\nTo address the crisis, TENAC chair Jim McGrath and TENAC legislative affairs coordinators Tom Gregory and Cynthia Pols, Esq. urged tenants at the meeting to support two rent control reform bills introduced in mid-June by departing D.C. Council member Jim Graham (Democrat- Ward 1).\n\nTENAC board members and attendees also heard from Jenny Reed, policy director of the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute, Elina Bravve, research analyst of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, and Drew Gossett of the Episcopalian-run Friendship House in far northwest D.C. on the depth and scope of the District's low-income housing dilemmas. Also speaking at the event were representatives of several D.C. government agencies charged with assisting low-income and middle-income residents, a representative of at-large Council member Anita Bonds, and former Council member and one-time liberal Republican candidate for mayor Carol Schwartz.\n\nSchwartz, who was warmly greeted by TENAC chair McGrath and hailed as a long-time friend of low income housing, said that she retired from politics a few years ago after a group of wealthy local business owners organized a PAC to defeat her in the Republican primary, apparently because of her support for legislation to provide paid sick leave for all D.C. workers. The changes the Republican Party has undergone in recent years mean she can no longer call herself Republican, Schwartz said, but she is returning to run for mayor as an independent out of concern for the District's \"property and its people. We are giving our property away and pushing our people out,\" Schwartz said.\n\nSchwartz vowed to make low-income housing and the rights of tenants one of her priority issues if elected, adding: \"I hope you'll pick me (for mayor*\\[BM1\\]*). After all, you've picked everyone else, tried everyone else.\" Laughter and some applause greeted this remark.\n\nTENAC legislative affairs coordinators Gregory and Pols, in discussing Council member Graham's two rent control reform bills, noted that D.C.'s existing rent control laws allows landlords to raise rents on most tenants by an amount equal to the official rise in the cost of living each year, plus an added 2 percent. Thanks to the magic of compound interest, Gregory said, the extra 2 percent essentially blows a hole through rent control in the District. In addition, landlords can raise rents by up to 10 percent in a year when renting out empty units, can apply for \"hardship\" exemptions from rent control with relatively little oversight from the city, and can exceed the rent control rules by persuading enough of their tenants to sign \"voluntary\" agreements allowing this.\n\nGraham's proposed Rent Control Amendment Act of 2014 (B20-830) and his Rent Control Improvement and Protection Amendment Act of 2014 (B20-837) have somewhat overlapping provisions that would at least partly fix these flaws in the rent control law, according to Pols.\n\nEach bill has the support of Council chair Phil Mendelson and a number of cosponsors on the Council; however, B2-830 is bottled up in an Economic Development Committee chaired by Council member and mayoral candidate Muriel Bowser, who seems disinclined to release it for a vote before the full Council. B20-837 is now before another committee chaired by Council member Vincent Orange, who so far has not indicated whether he supports it.\n\nTo get the Council to act on rent control reform this year, TENAC's leadership is urging all D.C. residents in favor to contact their own Council members asking them to cosponsor both bills.

Council's legislative website at [*http://lims.dccouncil.us/*](http://lims.dccouncil.us/) and type the number of the bill desired into the search menu box.","order":2},{"title":"Good Reads for midsummer 2014","date":"2014-07-13","issue":"June 2014","author":"","body":"**Good Reads leads off with a precis of a *Dollars & Sense* endorsement of a financial transaction tax as a tool for curbing \"casino capitalism\"**\n\nThe \"financialization\" of the U.S. economy since the early 1970s and the speculation it has given rise to have done real damage to the nation and the world, the leftwing economics journal *Dollars & Sense* reports in its May/June 2014 issue. Although mainstream media have reacted to Michael Lewis's recent expose of high-frequency trading, *Flash Boys,* with debates over what this means for \"investors,\" economist and D&S contributor Doug Orr concludes that what most high-volume Wall Street traders do is not \"investing\" at all, but simply high-stakes gambling. In short, \"The biggest casino in the world is located at the corner of Wall Street and Broad Street in New York City,\" and calling the players in the New York Stock Exchange investors distorts the truth. Their financial gambling, Orr contends, \"has become a massive drain of resources away from the real, productive economy and has made the overall economy more unstable.\"\n\nTo rein in the gambling and promote a return to a more healthy and productive form of capitalism, D&S argues, the U.S. government needs to undertake several reforms. One is eliminating tax breaks for speculative financial activity that make it more lightly taxed than the incomes of most middle-class American workers. Another essential step is reestablishing a 20<sup>th</sup>-century version of the old Glass-Steagall Act which enforced a separation between speculative investment banking and ordinary deposit banking for almost six decades, until the Clinton administration and a Republican Congress joined to repeal it in the 1990s.\n\nThe government also needs to enforce the provisions of the existing Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and adopt new regulations to curb non-bank speculation involving \"increasingly arcane financial derivatives,\" according to the article. Orr, a professor of economics at City College of San Francisco, also calls for the White House and Congress to reduce speculation by putting \"a tax on this socially destructive behavior\" through some form of financial transaction tax (FTT). Unlike the modest 0.5% FTT that several federal legislators have proposed, however, Orr concludes that to discourage speculative trading, \"the tax should be set at 1% and an additional tax of 0.1% should be charged on all cancelled orders.\"\n\nIn a somewhat dissenting article on casino capitalism in the same issue of *Dollars & Sense*, the Marxist economist Costas Lapavitsas of the University of London takes some issue with radical U.S. economists \"who see financialization as the outcome of policy measures, particularly financial liberalization or deregulation ...\" Government policy alone, Lapavitsas argues, cannot explain all the characteristics of any \"long-lasting era.\" Instead, he attributes the remarkable rise of financial speculation in the U.S. and global economies since the 1980s to \"a transformation at the deepest level of capitalist accumulation.\" To Lapavitsas, this in turn can be explained only in terms of \"the deepest material development of capitalism, things like the technological revolution that has taken place in the last four decades, the transformation of work, and similarly basic factors of the economy.\"\n\nFor more on Orr's and Lapavitsas's somewhat contrasting accounts of casino capitalism and the free-market \"neoliberalism\" that promotes it, see *Dollars & Sense* at [*http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2014/0514orr.html*](http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2014/0514orr.html) *— Andy Feeney*\n\n**AND LINKS TO OTHER GOOD READS, WITH COME-ONS...**\n\n&gt;&gt;You can read about our event in support of Cecily McMillan in the newsletter leader; here's another chance at the clip from the Mike Malloy Show in which she gets to testify about DSA and its scope:\n\n[*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im\\_nvrIB-Rw&list=UUpU4j-LN\\_aibXA1gONvWzxw*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im_nvrIB-Rw&list=UUpU4j-LN_aibXA1gONvWzxw)\n\n&gt;&gt;How does inequality grow, day to day?

Unfortunately, time runs out next month for amending laws to meet federal requirements and in other respects, including funding, the U.S. program will begin to wind down through 2015.\n\nKnown in Germany as *kurzarbeit* (literally \"short work\"), the strategy goes back to German union initiatives in 1985 to increase employment. Back then it was an outgrowth of earlier measures by socialist governments in France and Belgium to increase employment by simply reducing the work week to 35 hours.\n\nIn Germany, the initiative came from major companies seeking to avoid the mass U.S.-style layoffs of the 1980s and ever since. German firms have had, by law, union representatives on their boards of directors since the early postwar era. *Kurzarbeit* has been credited with avoiding in Germany the full slump that hit its neighbors as the 2008 crisis spread through Europe, and with speeding that nation's economic recovery, now in full swing.\n\nThe original conception is simple. Instead of letting go of 20 workers in a facility of 100, all 100 get a 20 percent cut in their work hours and pay; moreover, the German state deems the workers partially unemployed, thus compensates them accordingly on a pro-rata basis. This spares the worker the dislocation, psychological drawbacks and family disruption of job loss; it also assures that the worker's skills keep up with the latest in his or her occupation.\n\nSome economists, notably Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Microeconomic Analysis Jennifer Hunt, have questioned the value of work sharing. In a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Hunt found that in the 1980s work sharing increased employment and benefited workers as wages rose; however, she said the growth rate was smaller than in the United States and there was some loss of output. In *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*, Hunt speculated that it might lead employers to seek other \"inputs\" rather than labor.\n\nHowever, in the broader policy arena observers ranging from the likes of Kevin Hassett, from the conservative American Enterprise Institute, to economist Dean Baker, of the progressive-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, have publicly given high marks to U.S. work sharing.\n\nAs a result, the American policy of short-time compensation (STC) is federal law. In 2012, Congress passed legislation pushed by Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn) to help launch STC programs. Also, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act, signed Feb. 22, 2012 by President Obama, includes the Layoff Prevention Act of 2012, which offers subsidies to states starting STC programs, including $100 million in grants.\n\nIn [*the states that amend their unemployment insurance laws*](http://www.reed.senate.gov/news/release/reeds-layoff-prevention-law-helps-save-over-950-ri-jobs) as required for STC, employers may voluntarily arrange to reduce work hours between 10 and 60 percent and allow workers to claim partial unemployment insurance. The workers, like any UI claimants, must be available for other work during those compensated hours and submit to all the other requirements of unemployment compensation.\n\nThe District of Columbia is a participating jurisdiction. Maryland has an STC program; Virginia as of 2013 does not. Otherwise, the states that currently have STC programs include the predictable ones: the Northeast and New England, the Great Lakes states and the entire West Coast. In the South, only Arkansas and Florida have an STC program. The Southwest states include Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Oklahoma. The Central states with STC are Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.","order":4},{"title":"Panel, New Bills Raise Hope for Relief For Millions of Long-term Unemployed","date":"2014-07-13","issue":"June 2014","author":"","body":"*****By Woody Woodruff* and *Andy Feeney*\n\nAs Democrats and Republicans argue over exactly how well President Obama's policies are promoting the recovery of American capitalism, the plight of the long-term unemployed has become a quiet crisis. Since December, millions of jobless Americans have been left in desperate straits because their unemployment compensation has run out and Congress has failed to renew long-term unemployment insurance benefits. The number of jobless people affected has now grown to 3.1 million. However, there is some hope — a slim one, at least — that a bitterly divided Congress might possibly address their plight before the fall elections.\n\nIn April, the Senate passed a bill to renew benefits for the long-term unemployed, but the House gave the bill no consideration. Now a bipartisan pair of senators, Jack Reed (D) of Rhode Island and Dean Heller (R) of Nevada, have [*launched a new attempt*](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/24/unemployment-extension_n_5525305.html?utm_hp_ref=politics) to restore the benefit. As of June 28 the two had been joined by Republican Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Dale Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, who [*introduced a companion bill in the House*](http://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/2014/06/26/lobiondo-kildee-introduce-bipartisan-extension-of-unemployment-benefits-a-522864.html#.U6yxZ7Etc1k). Unlike the dead-end Senate bill passed in April, the new House and Senate bills will not provide back compensation for those whose benefits were cut off in December. Instead, a statement from the House sponsors says it \"allows eligible job seekers who were cut-off on December 28, 2013 to continue where they left off in the UI claims process.\"\n\nWhether this bipartisan effort to help the long-term unemployed can pass a bitterly partisan Congress this year is unclear, to say the least. In the meantime, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, a longtime progressive, is continuing to build support for his proposed,[*\"Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Training Act\"*](http://www.johnconyers.com/hr-1000-humphrey-hawkins-full-employment-and-training-act#.U62bLLEtc1k)of 2014, a bill that would impose a light financial transaction tax on Wall Street speculators in order to fund public job creation by state and local governments in areas where unemployment is especially severe.\n\nAs part of his long-term effort to address the plight of the jobless, Conyers earlier this year sparked the formation of a new House Caucus, the*Full Employment Caucus*. Another initiative sponsored by Conyers' office was the holding of a panel discussion on the effects and possible cures of long-term unemployment on June 24 in the Rayburn House Office Building. At the event, Conyers told the hundred-plus attendees that action is needed now to counterthe \"low pace of employment restoration\" that is damaging the welfare of both individuals and the nation at large.\n\nAt the event, moderatorArthur Delaney of the *Huffington Post* described his interviews with long-term unemployed and the evident effects of unemployment on their health and self-confidence, and recommended German-style job sharing as one remedy for the problem. Panelist [*Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute*](http://www.epi.org/publication/truth-todays-long-term-unemployment-crisis/) agreed that policies to \"spread total hours work across more workers\" are a critical element of a broad-gauged package of solutions that also include renewing the long-term unemployment benefit program and increasing policies that increase aggregate demand in the economy, such as more relief to states (rehiring fired teachers, nurses, public safety workers) and infrastructure restoration spending.\n\nShierholz vigorously disputed the argument from the right that long-term benefits are a disincentive to seek work: \"The empirical evidence strongly rejects this concern.\" Nor, she said, does long-term unemployment result in a skills deficit or damage to productivity among jobless workers – \"today's long-term unemployment crisis is not due to something wrong with these particular workers.\" Shierholz added that spending federal funds on jobless benefits, ironically, is one of the more effective ways of fighting unemployment, since providing money to jobless workers who will spend it, not save it,stimulates aggregate consumer demand and job growth. EPI calculations show that the loss of consumer demand caused by 3.4 million unemployed workers not receiving jobless benefits, Shierholz added, would itself cost the nation 300,000 jobs.\n\nPanelist Betsey Stevenson, labor economist member of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, also disputed many of the right wing's contentions about joblessness. Because there is empirical evidence that the long-term unemployed face discrimination in job seeking, she added, policy moves are required to insure fair treatment by potential employers of jobless workers who are victims of \"bad luck and hard times.\" Stevenson said the White House has demonstrated to certain businesses that their own HR departments are discriminating against the long-term unemployed and that the administration is pressuring such employers to improve their practices.\n\nThe professional social network LinkedIn, Stevenson said, has just released a [*jobseeker application*](http://blog.linkedin.com/2014/06/19/new-job-search-mobile-app/) to improve access to opportunities as they are posted. There was no discussion by the panel on how many long-term unemployed had access to smartphones.\n\nAs for the government promoting economic policies that can restore rapid growth in job creation, Stevenson suggested in the event's question and answer session, the options that Obama administration faces are limited. Three major factors make for slow growth in job creation at present: \"Recovery from a financial crisis is always slow and difficult;\" also, the US since 2009 has seen an \"unprecedented\" loss in jobs with state and local government, and finally the Baby Boomers are retiring, which reduces consumer demand and hurts job creation. Despite some political resistance, Stevenson suggested, the Obama administration is working to \"make sure this is a fair recovery,\" notably by supporting a higher minimum wage and the availability of pre-school programs for all American children.\n\nAnother way that the Obama White House is trying to make progress on long-term unemployment, Stevenson said, is through the forging of public-private partnerships. Examples include the \"Skills for Chicago and the Future\" program that has been expanding the training and the skills of jobless workers in Chicago, as well as the federal government's funding of \"ready to work partnerships\" under the Department of Labor's H1B program, in which businesses receive support for providing jobless workers with paid internships and paid work experience.\n\nOne White House goal, Stevenson said, is to \"work with businesses that have signed the pledge\" to help jobless workers, \"to find out what works and what doesn't.\"\n\nPanelist Judy Conti, of the National Employment Law Project, pointed out that the biggest crisis overall is that \"there aren't enough jobs and enough people filling those jobs.\" The plight of the long-term jobless is only part of the crisis, Conti said: \"less than half of the unemployed \\[overall\\] are getting benefits\" at this point. Her organization has not given up on the fight to reauthorize long-term unemployment benefits, Conti said, but the focus has been on trying to get people back to work. There is surprising bipartisan agreement that getting people back to work is important, she added, but one problem is how to fund this. People on the left tend to want to finance job creation and unemployment benefits through tax reforms that increase costs to business: \"people on the right tend to favor reducing spending ... often on other programs helping low income people.\"\n\nConti joined the panel consensus on the need for spending on infrastructure recovery and resumption of aid to states that has been cut through sequestration, to re-employ laid-off teachers and other public employees. She said the latter measure alone would cut the unemployment rate by one percent. And she noted that the automation of corporate hiring practices through Internet applications and Internet applicant screening is discriminating against the long-term unemployed with screening software that bumps those with low credit scores. This is \"a horrible Catch-22\" for many long-term jobless who have hard times paying their bills, since the longer these workers remain unemployed, the worse their credit ratings tend to become; and the worse their credit ratings become, the harder they find it to obtain work.\n\nAlong with Stevenson, Conti called for public-private partnerships as one tool in fighting long-term unemployment, and she urged \"employers to train hiring managers to overcome subconscious biases against unemployed workers.\" The NELP furnished a position paper at the panel event, [*\"Tackling the Long-term Unemployment Crisis\"*](http://www.nelp.org/page/-/UI/2014/Issue-Brief-Tackling-Long-Term-Unemployment-Crisis.pdf?nocdn=1), that details many of the proposals Conti brought to the panel.\n\nAlso scheduled to speak on the June 24 panel, but unable to attend for health reasons, was Michael R. Strain, of the moderate conservative American Enterprise Institute (AEI). Strain is the author of a Winter 2014 article in *National Affairs*entitled \"A Jobs Agenda for the Right,\" which argues strongly that the job destruction effects of the recent \"Great Recession\" are haunting the economy still.

For example, he suggests at one point accepting a \"sub-minimum wage\" for some job categories to bolster hiring, with the federal government then subsidizing the workers receiving such a wage by bolstering their incomes, probably through the earned income tax credit. Conti at the June 24 panel discussion vehemently rejected any idea of the \"sub-minimum\" wage being a solution.\n\n**However, political progressives are likely to welcome some of Strain's other suggestions, including his heretical support for the Federal Reserve's \"quantitative easing\" (QE) policies and the notion of \"carefully targeted infrastructure spending.\"\n\n**According to Strain, \"Many conservatives have criticized QE, but unfairly so,\" since there is reason to think that QE has stimulated demand in the housing market and created more jobs for construction workers, while arguably having a \"positive effect on the economy as a signal in and of itself of the Fed's commitment to a strong labor market.\"\n\nAlthough Strain did not speak at the June 24 event, all the other panelists bemoaned the congressional gridlock that has kept new federal money out of the workforce equation.\n\nAs moderator Delaney recalled, the first opponent of long-term unemployment compensation renewal was former Sen. Jim Bunning, who initially earned some enmity even from Republican colleagues for his intransigence in blocking the funding of renewed long-term jobless benefits. Now, Delaney acknowledged, Bunning's callous disregard of the long-term jobless has become Republican gospel, meaning the House is likely to be a constant barrier to renewed benefits for these workers.\n\nPresent at the June 24 panel event were two local DSA members as well as a representative of the National Jobs for All Coalition (NJFAC). The latter group, which like DSA has made passage of Conyers' HR 1000 a priority, has worked with the Congressional Full Employment Caucus to co-host a July 9 -10 strategy briefing on building a national movement for full employment.\n\nSee [*www.njfac.org*](http://www.njfac.org/) for more details and updates on the national strategy session.

By Benjamin Ross. Oxford University Press, 2014, 249 pp.\n\n\n\nThe subject of suburban sprawl is already the focus of a semi-genre of books that have decried the soullessness, ugliness and environmental destructiveness of unchecked exurban development. Authors such as Jane Holtz Kay, James Howard Kunstler and Daniel Lazare have built on each other's works to build a case for urban living, \"smart growth\" and transit-oriented communities, and against the housing subdivisions, office parks and shopping malls that have spread across the landscape like kudzu in the years following the Second World War. Nevertheless, these critics have been mostly on the losing end of a 70-year war battle against sprawl.\n\nWith *Dead End: Suburban Sprawl and the Rebirth of American Urbanism,* Ben Ross has joined the ranks of sprawl's critics, although he himself lives in the suburbs – albeit the relatively urbanized Montgomery County, Md. Ross, an environmental scientist by trade (and who was at one time affiliated with DSA), was moved to write his book after many years of advocacy for Maryland's proposed light-rail \"Purple Line\" that would connect many of the closer-in Montgomery and Prince George's County communities. Ross draws from his experiences – as well as from an impressive body of research – to produce a highly readable historical study of the origins of urban sprawl, why it has been so hard to limit over the past decades, and how a changing political landscape might be turning the tide against sprawl.\n\nRoss covers much of the ground already sown by earlier critics of suburbia, but he adds an original contribution to the literature: the extent to which the growth of suburbs has been driven by suburbanites' desire to gain and protect social status. The earliest advocates of suburbanization, such as French utopian socialist Charles Fourier, were driven by concern for workers crowded into unhealthy tenements during the Industrial Revolution – and even Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels called for the \"abolition of the distinction between town and country.\" However, once suburbs took off in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, they quickly became bastions of wealth and privilege – and whiteness.\n\nRoss credits Frederick Law Olmstead, the late-19<sup>th</sup>-century landscape architect, as being the father of the modern park-like suburb, as seen in his plan for Riverside, Ill., with its winding streets, houses set back from the curb, and plentiful greenery. Olmstead's work came before the auto age, and his suburbs revolved around rail stations, making them necessarily small and relatively compact, with a modest commercial district near the station. Decades later, the coming of the car unmoored suburbs from public transportation, making possible the rise of subdivisions containing nothing but housing, where residents might have to drive miles for a quart of milk.\n\nOlmstead also was architect of the covenant, a restrictive clause attached to a house's deed that placed conditions on use of the property. Early covenants contained language banning commercial activities in the home and requiring payments to homeowners' associations. The early 20<sup>th</sup> century saw the rise of covenants banning racial and ethnic minorities from owning properties in certain communities; these were mostly used to keep out blacks, but some covenants also excluded \"Jews ...Italians, Greeks and Slavs.\"\n\nCovenants, in Ross' analysis, were one leg of a three-legged stool used by suburban nimbys – a neologism derived from the phrase \"not in my backyard\" – to keep unwanted people and property uses out of their neighborhoods. The other two legs were zoning and historic preservation. Zoning built on covenants by putting the muscle of local government behind land-use restrictions, while historic preservation laws have been abused by \"\\[n\\]imbys who pose as preservationists,\" speaking \"of why they like the old building, when their real passion is dislike of the new one.\" And, of course, the cost of upscale suburban development has effectively excluded persons of modest means.\n\nThe resistance of suburbanites – and many urbanites as well – to changes in their surroundings have often been attributed to concern about property values. Ross, however, argues that these homeowners often undercut the values of their own properties by opposing denser development, especially high-end apartments and retail, that would make surrounding tracts more valuable. Likewise, zoning, covenants and historic preservation place limits on homeowners' use of their properties, thereby undercutting their value. The nimbys' real motivation, Ross says, is to preserve their status as persons of privilege by keeping \"less prestigious people and activities out of their neighborhoods.\"\n\nWhile the quest for status fueled the rise of suburbs, Ross argues, it has sometimes had an upside for cities as well. As far back as the 1920s, certain subcultures have rebelled against the sterility and isolation of suburbs, and Jane Jacobs' seminal 1961 book *The Death and Life of Great American Cities* gave urban living a new cachet. Bohemians, artists, and political radicals have long embraced the vitality, density and diversity of cities – ironically leading many counter-cultural enclaves to become magnets for affluent status seekers who proceed to gentrify their neighborhoods. Once funky locales such as Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco as well as several DC neighborhoods (the U St. corridor is one example) become the stomping grounds for new urbanites who embrace their neighborhood's bohemian reputation while choking it to death with their un-bohemian lifestyles.\n\nStatus-seeking certainly has had a role in suburban and urban development, although I think Ross gives it greater weight than it deserves – compared to the quest for corporate profit, which has been the biggest driver of suburban growth. Developers acquire cheap land in the suburbs, lobby governments to build and expand highways to and through their properties (supposedly to relieve congestion on existing roads), and then make big profits from building housing, offices and shopping malls. They then move farther out, and repeat. Ross does not ignore this, and he explore the role of a broad coalition of right-wingers – funded by the Kochs and Mellons, given an intellectual sheen by conservative think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute, and joined by the Tea Party – to fight back against limits on suburban growth, with some success. The urban growth boundary adopted by Portland, Ore., has been a specific target of the right's ire, but the limits have thus far survived efforts to overturn them. Yet Ross ascribes this backlash to fears of single-family homeowners being robbed of \"their privileged place in the residential pecking order\" more than to corporations angry about being told where they can and can't build.\n\nRoss offers many of the same solutions as other critics of suburbia: better public transportation, denser development, removing subsidies for drivers and limiting parking. He does, however, frame his solutions within the context of expanded democracy – of the need to overturn \"snob zoning\" with true public control of development. \"The principle of one person, one vote must replace the restricted voting of suburban land tenure,\" he writes.\n\nHe goes beyond mere policy solutions to also offer political strategy, based on his experiences with Maryland's Purple Line. The potential exists, he believes, for a pro-urban, anti-sprawl coalition of environmentalists, transit advocates, promoters of low-cost housing and, yes, developers seeking to profit from the opportunities that smart growth makes possible.\n\nThe future of cities and suburbs is still being written, as is the fate of Ross's beloved Purple Line – which, although it has cleared many political and bureaucratic hurdles, has yet to break ground. Yet with growing concern over global warming and climate change, the need to address the environmental impact of the car and car-dependent suburbs has never been greater. *Dead End* adds a valuable resource to this effort.\n\n[*Supreme Court Majority Rulings: More Rights for Corporations, Fewer Rights for Women and Labor*](http://dsadc.org/supreme-court-majority-rulings-more-rights-for-corporations-fewer-rights-for-women-and-labor-2/)\n\nSunday, July 13th, 2014\n\n***The Washington Socialist &lt;&gt;* Summer 2014**\n\n*****By Kurt Stand*\n\nAfter home health workers successfully organized in Illinois, their wages increased, they had opportunities for skill-training previously lacking, and they were able to get health care coverage previously unavailable. None of that was of interest to the majority of Supreme Court justices, however, who ruled in *Harris v. Quinn* that they were not \"full-fledged public employees,\" thus could not be required to pay dues. The result, for unions in that sector, will be a massive loss of revenue, making it more difficult to organize and represent a group of workers who already are hard-placed to assert their rights.\n\nWorkers impacted by that ruling are overwhelmingly women and comprise the working poor. The Supreme Court's decision in *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby* and *Conestoga Wood Specialties v.* *Burwell* specifically impacted women, by allowing categories of for-profit corporations to refuse to allow their employees contraceptive coverage in their health plans. The result puts a further burden on women, especially those least able to afford any additional expense.\n\nThe consequence of each decision, with those who sit in comfort rejecting or making decisions that harm those who have fewer resources is a commentary on the political direction of our times. As many have noted too, this is another instance in which the \"family-friendly\" rhetoric of the conservative right is contradicted by the anti-woman social polices they put in place. And each decision was political, reflecting an agenda that, since Reagan's presidency, has been pushed by all three branches of the federal government whenever the opportunity has presented itself.\n\nAlthough the Court majority was careful in both cases to not make as sweeping a decision as they might have done, in neither case as sweeping as they might have been, both the Harris and Hobby Lobby cases represent a chipping away of previously established rights and practices and open the door for further limitations on women's reproductive rights, and workers' labor rights. Moreover, Hobby Lobby's restriction on an Affordable Care Act mandate represents a further step in limiting the federal government's ability to protect vulnerable parts of the population, while the logic behind the Harris decision marks a step toward reducing the ability of unions to engage in political action. The vigorous dissents of Ruth Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan notwithstanding, the Court majority has been building a set of precedents that threaten the entire legal edifice of pre-existing social and labor programs, and of protection of civil and women's rights.\n\nService Employees International Union (SEIU) President Mary Kay Henry spoke to that danger in a press release decrying the Hobby Lobby decision: \"The Court's decisions today will cause real harm to the physical and economic health of America's women workers and their families. Beyond that, the decisions may open the door to even broader attacks on preventive healthcare and also basic workplace rights, including freedom from gender discrimination or the right to unite together in a union.\"\n\nThe restrictions on those rights stand in contrast to the Supreme Court's extension of corporate rights. The logic of the Court's grant of free speech rights to corporations in its Citizens United ruling is evident in the recent cases too – which was the focus of a statement issued by National Nurses Union (NNU) Executive Director Rose Ann DeMoro, \"The goal of the anti-union crowd is to disempower the ability of nurses and other healthcare workers to speak out for patient and public safety on everything from food inspections to a healthier environment to safer health care settings.\" She then added, with specific reference to the Hobby Lobby decision for its direct attack on women's health: \"Increasingly we see this court cynically manipulating the tradition of free speech to further expand the power of corporations over all segments of public life,\" said DeMoro. \"From decisions that money equals free speech, which especially benefits large corporate interests to protecting corporations from consumer challenges to anti-union decisions, the First Amendment has been steadily corrupted by this court.\"\n\nThese decisions those go to a core divide in US society – who has the freedom to choose, to act. The implication of these decisions and of the overall corporate/conservative agenda is that liberty and power should reside in those with wealth. Business can determine who gets (or doesn't get) health care, business can determine who works (or doesn't), for how much and for how long. It is a direction that is profoundly undemocratic socially, yet at the same time is profoundly hostile to individual freedom — for it is women's individual right to control her own body, it is health care worker's individual ability to attain a secure standard of living that these decisions call into question. The Supreme Court's actions should serve as a reminder that only through broad democratic participation and control over political and economic institutions, only through broad and universal social provisions, can individual liberty be maintained. Preventing such assaults on popular rights will require, in the months and years ahead, renewed organizing, public action and electoral action aimed not only at challenging the specific policies now being imposed, but also the ideological and political climate that allows these to take place.

The Czar's and the Soviet's absolutist legacy has minimized local governance and citizen initiative. Ukraine leaders, like Russia's, appoint the heads of its states, thus consolidating power at the top and minimizing local representation. This lack of civic dynamism contributes to the current problems by hiding differences unless there is open revolt, dodging the messy democratic process of resolving differences in the public sphere. The privilege of national power may also figure in the economic corruption that has infected both Russia and Ukraine. An irony of the East and West during the cold War was that in the West you could disparage the government but not your foreman. In the East you could disparage your foreman but not the government. Limiting criticism of your government only allows differences to fester and maybe leaves leaders free to focus on their own advantage instead of serving the people.\n\nAnother issue in Ukraine is its potential relationship with the European Union (E.U.). Given what E.U. austerity has done to southern Europe, some have to ask why join it. One answer is that such a move may limit corruption and thus eventually allow the economy and democracy to grow. What has been played up is the political differences between Ukraine's East and West. Ukraine's East is not only more Russian culturally and historically, but its business is more with Russia. Ukraine's defense industry in the East is still providing material and services with Russia's military. Otherwise they would shut down.\n\nRussia's role in Ukraine suggests a focus not readily understood. Russia' breaking treaties and grabbing Crimea has made some in Sweden and Finland nervous and consider joining NATO. The reaction by a senior advisor to Putin was: \"Finland should think of the consequences, if it ponders joining NATO. It must ask could joining start World War III?\" This advisor also called the E.U. colonies of the U.S. Some in Russia seem to believe the Ukraine problem is a U.S. plot.\n\nRussia and the U.S. see themselves as uniquely important world leaders. Some of us think we are so important that we only see other \"world leaders\" as the actors. This Czar-like self-aggrandizement has affected both the U.S. and Russian self-image while smaller countries like Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq have to teach us humility. Let's hope we all learn humility soon. We will not be able to see the world viably until we can see all the actors.

One spirit had led Scrooge to revisit the holidays of his own past; the second had shown to him the difficult lives led by the English lower classes – including that of his clerk, Bob Cratchit, and his family – this Christmas and every day; the third had foretold Scrooge's own death and how little sorrow there would be to see the old miser go. He mulled over the message of the ghosts and the visions they had revealed to him. Should he repent of a life dedicated to accumulating money and use some of his wealth to help raise up the less fortunate?\n\nThen he thought of his journeys of the past night, how real yet unreal, and how so much seemingly had happened as would easily occupy a week or more. All of that could not have happened in a single night, Scrooge thought. Then he suddenly slapped himself on the forehead: It had been only a dream! There were no spirits; he had not left the comfort of his bedroom! It had all been in his head.\n\nScrooge breathed a sigh of relief. \"And to think, I had almost convinced myself to change my ways, to give up the pursuit of profit!\" he said. \"Imagine how that would have drained my bank account! Become a woolly-headed old philanthropist tossing coins to beggars in the streets. How could free enterprise prosper if every businessman acted that way?\"\n\nHe now felt like his old self again. Happily he shaved and dressed, and then strolled out into the busy street where he greeted every \"Merry Christmas!\" with a testy \"Bah! Humbug!\" He stopped by a confectionary store where he bought two dozen gingerbread men, and then returned home to enjoy biting off their heads.\n\nBut his greatest joy was anticipating returning to the office the following day. Cratchit would surely slink in late, no doubt hung over from the previous day's merrymaking. When I catch him not at his desk on time, Scrooge thought, I'll put the fear of dismissal into his head, and then dock his pay! He rubbed his hands eagerly. Maybe Christmas can be joyful after all, he mused.\n\nAnd so on Boxing Day Scrooge walked into his office a few minutes before nine. As he had predicted, Cratchit's chair was unoccupied. Scrooge took a seat at his own desk and was having a pleasant time reading his profit ledgers when he heard a commotion outside.\n\n\"What the dickens is that?\" Scrooge barked to himself. He hurried to the door and flung it open to find himself face to face with Cratchit. The clerk was not alone; behind him stood a line of men and women, many of them – it seemed to Scrooge – bearing a strong resemblance to the working-class characters he had seen during his outing with the Ghost of Christmas Present. All were carrying placards bearing slogans such as \"Unfair!\" \"Scrooge Abuses His Workers!\" and \"A Living Wage for All Cratchits!\" They were chanting a slogan such as Scrooge had never heard: \"The people united/will never be defeated!\" The people – united! What kind of nonsense was that?\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" Scrooge screamed at Cratchit. \"You were supposed to be at your desk fifteen minutes ago! Get to work this instant or you're fired!\"\n\n\"Not until our demands are met,\" said Cratchit calmly. \"We are on strike – against you and all bosses who drive workers like slaves for starvation wages.\"\n\n\"All of us 'ave walked out!\" shouted a man whose sooty clothes identified him as a coal miner. \"We can't expect you rich folk to do the right thing out of the goodness of yer 'earts, can we?\"\n\n\"Once a capitalist, always a capitalist!\" said a young woman, attired for factory work. \"It's in yer blood.\"\n\n\"We don't want none of yer charity!\" shouted a man. \"We'll fight for what's rightfully ours!\"\n\nCratchit handed Scrooge a leaflet, which the old man perused nervously. It listed the workers' demands: a living wage, health benefits, safe working conditions, retirement pensions. \"What?\" bellowed Scrooge. \"Have you all gone mad?\"\n\n\"No, we've just come to our senses,\" Cratchit replied.\n\n\"I'll bring you to your senses!\" Scrooge screamed. \"You're fired!\"\n\n\"And who will do all the work – you?\" Cratchit asked. Scrooge looked around at the determined faces of the picketing workers.\n\n\"Bah! Humbug!\" he screamed, before hastily fleeing into the sanctuary of his office. As he cowered inside, the marching and chanting outside resumed.\n\nPanting and sweating, Scrooge looked warily at the leaflet Cratchit had handed him. What now? Scrooge wondered. What would he and his fellow business owners do?\n\nHe had no idea. \"God help us every one,\" he moaned.","order":0},{"title":"Facing the Next Two Years of GOP Dominance: Thoughts on Progressive Responses to the Election","date":"2014-12-01","issue":"December 2014","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"For socialists and other progressives, as we look back on the event, there's some good news and some bad news about the 2014 election. The good news, for some of us, is that some timid and mediocre Democrats this year lost their bids for political office. Their losses, which many analysts had expected, arguably stemmed from an inability or unwillingness to present low-income and middle class voters, African Americans, Latinos and younger voters with a compelling reason to come to the polls on Nov. 4.\n\nSome progressives therefore see the election as powerful evidence that the Democratic Party, to mobilize its own political base, urgently needs to become much more progressive, especially on issues of income inequality and job creation. Thus it's possible that this year's low turnout and stunning Democratic losses will result, over time, in a better Democratic Party. There's also a minority on the left sees the election as reason for progressives to abandon the Democratic Party entirely for some third party that presumably would be better — for example, the Greens.\n\nThe bad news about the election, of course, and some would say the terrible news, is that a ruthless, hypocritical, economically elitist, scientifically brain-dead, racist, demagogic, gay-bashing, immigrant-bashing, religiously bigoted, union-busting and sexist GOP managed to win extensive power, both nationally and in dozens of state governments.\n\nObviously when we consider the historical long term, this year's Republican sweep of the Senate races and the victories of numerous conservative Republican governors don't compare to, say, the devastation of medieval Europe by the Plague, or the sacking of Rome by the Visigoths. On the other hand, many winning Republicans this year apparently do have the morals of Visigoths.\n\nOver the past generation, the GOP has gained growing political clout partly by prostituting its policy wing to powerful rightwing corporations and the super-wealthy, as political scientist Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson have noted in their book *Winner-Take-All Politics.* In service to the upper \"1 percent,\" Republicans since Reagan's day have racked up enormous national debts by giving sweeping tax cuts to the rich, then have turned around and argued that in the interest of \"balanced budgets,\" it is urgently important to slash liberal spending programs to help the poor, the middle class and the environment.\n\nRecently many of these same Republicans have demanded reductions in federal spending for food stamps at the very time they have denounced Obama for failing to improve the economy enough to reduce poverty and unemployment – a stunning display of political hypocrisy and Social Darwinism that seems designed to reduce low-income Americans to economic desperation.\n\nOver the past few years, partly in response to Obama's sweeping 2008 election victory, Republicans at the state level also have worked diligently to suppress the voting – and some would say, the voting rights – of low-income voters and racial minorities. In this way they have essentially worked to undermine American democracy, no matter what they may think they are doing: in the view of some black commentators, they are effectively working to bring back Jim Crow politics, at least in the South.\n\nRepublican governors in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Indiana over the past few years have drastically reduced the bargaining rights of unions. Michigan governor Rick Snyder's astounding success in making his state – long a bastion of the UAW, and hence of union strength – into a \"right to work\" state strikes some pessimistic labor observers as a blow aimed at the very existence of organized labor in this country.\n\nRepublican attacks on \"welfare cheaters\" over the years, meanwhile, have repeatedly used racially loaded code words to spread negative stereotypes about black Americans in general, amounting to what some critics call \"dog whistle\" racist politics, and the Republican Party's longstanding homophobia and attacks on women's reproductive rights are notorious.\n\nIn terms of global climate change, the GOP leadership today appears to be split between politicians who, like Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, may actually have convinced themselves that the whole issue is a giant liberal hoax designed to wreck the U.S. economy, and a minority of intelligent Republicans, like John McCain and Mitt Romney, who must know better, and have said so in the past, but are now willing to reverse course 180 degrees and lie about the problem for political advantage.\n\nNow, for all intents and purposes, the fine, upstanding people who have been promoting this brand of sleazy politics for the past generation are apparently going to dominate the U.S. Senate and a majority of state governments around the country through 2016. What are these likely to bring us in the way of political leadership — except stupidity, hypocrisy, cruelty and greed?\n\nAnd yet no matter how angry some progressives are about this reality, and no matter how depressed or simply numb others may feel in the wake of the Nov. 4 results, the practical question facing all of us is what do we need to do now, under adverse circumstances, to work and fight for a better future in what promises to be a fairly bad time?\n\nI can't speak for anyone in DSA except myself, but to me, the next two years present progressives and democratic socialists with several important challenges. One urgent one, arguably, is providing what solidarity we can to those groups and constituencies whom the Republicans have targeted most harshly in recent years – notably new immigrants, African American voters, the poor of all races, public-sector unions, and advocates for women's reproductive rights and freedoms. LGBT people also urgently need our support, although recent legal rulings in favor of gay marriage and polls showing a growing acceptance of gay people in this country, even among Republicans, may mean that the new GOP majority in the Senate won't be as hostile to gay rights as Republicans traditionally have been.\n\nHow much real support the progressive left can or will provide to liberal environmental groups over the next two years is a good question. However, environmental groups and environmental causes are likely to take a shellacking from the GOP-dominated Congress through 2016. Some extreme GOP conservatives, like Sen. Inhofe and Texas governor Rick Perry, are echoing the Koch brothers / fossil fuels industry / U.S. Chamber of Commerce line that excessive government regulation is the cause of most of the country's economic woes; therefore Republican attacks on EPA funding and EPA legal mandates seem fairly likely.\n\nOn the Keystone XL Pipeline issue, Senate Republicans and a minority of Senate Democrats have just failed by a one-vote margin to pass a filibuster-proof bill in favor of completing the pipeline's last leg, and when the Republicans take control of the Senate veto in January they seem likely to push through another pipeline bill that Obama will find it hard to resist. Already, in the run-up to the recent pipeline vote, *Washington Post* columnist Ruth Marcus has suggested that Obama needs to \"throw the Congressional Democrats under the bus\" on the pipeline, trading his approval for Keystone for GOP acquiescing to something else Obama wants – continued authorization for EPA to continue regulating CO² emissions from coal-burning power plants, for example. Some liberal Democrats also seem to favor letting the pipeline through in order to save the careers of the few remaining Democrats representing coal- and oil-dependent states, assuming that Louisiana senator Mary Landrieu survives a tough run-off race in a few weeks' time.\n\nOne of the sleeper issues that progressives urgently need to attend to over the coming months, meanwhile, is the risk that Obama and the new Republican leadership in the Senate, in order to prove that they can transcend partisan wrangling and \"get things done\" as voters supposedly are demanding, will agree on two sweeping new measures to benefit huge multinational corporations at the expense of labor, consumers, and even the legal sovereignty of American governments, whether at the state, local or federal level.\n\nJudging from analysis in the *Wall Street Journal, New York Times* and *Washington Post* published in the first few days after the election, two areas of likely bipartisan comprise that business interests are hoping the GOP victory will make possible are\n\n\\(A) passage of \"fast-track\" authority allowing Obama to push the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and possibly a proposed Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) through Congress with minimal debate; and\n\n\\(B) joint efforts by Republicans and Democrats to \"reform\" the U.S. tax code by drastically cutting income tax rates for large corporations.\n\nAccording to the Obama White House as well as the Republicans, corporate tax \"reform\" in the way of steeply lower rates is needed to make U.S. corporations more globally competitive, while possibly reducing the motivations big companies have for shifting their headquarters overseas to take advantage of so-called tax inversions. Even liberal Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon joined with Republican conservative Dave Camp of Michigan this year to propose a version of corporate tax reform, and with the GOP in charge of the Senate and liberal Democratic voices more muted than they have been, it's possible that such \"reform\" could now sail through Congress and be signed into law.\n\nSo far, the mainstream media report that bipartisan agreement on corporate tax reform has been blocked because Obama and the Democrats want such a tax law change to produce new revenue for the government, so as to reduce government deficit, while the Republicans – despites decades of grandstanding on and the U.S. national debt — are demanding that it be revenue-neutral. But if Democrats and Republicans can compromise their differences, corporate tax rates may be slashed further, at the likely cost of even greater income inequality being generated by the tax code.\n\nToward the end of November, veto threats from the White House appeared to stall a more pernicious version of this tax proposal, pending adjustment to ease the burden on poor and middleclass taxpayers.\n\nOn TPP, TTIP and other 'free trade\" issues, Obama is on record as favoring such agreements, both to contain Chinese economic power in the Pacific and supposedly as a way of generating new U.S. jobs. Public Citizen, on the other hand, has compared TPP to \"NAFTA on steroids\" and argued that it will give foreign corporations covered by the treaty the legal power to overturn U.S. laws that interfere with their profitability in ways that allegedly generate trade distortions.\n\nThe AFL-CIO and many environmental and consumer organizations have been hostile to TPP, and Harry Reid as Senate Majority Leader has blocked \"fast track\" legislation that would allow Obama to get such complex trade treaties through Congress with little debate. With Mitch McConnell replacing Reid in January, effective liberal Democratic opposition to a fast-track treatment for TPP will evaporate, leaving progressives hard-pressed to stop this corporate power grab.\n\nEven some Tea Party Republicans at the grassroots level are suspicious of corporate flight and \"free trade\" legislation, as demonstrated in the 1990s by Ross Perot's crusade against NAFTA; and this creates at least the potential for a truly \"bipartisan\" campaign to stop \"fast track\" authority for TPP approval. Yet it remains to be seen whether socialists, liberals, green activists, unions and grassroots Republicans can mobilize enough popular resistance to keep corporate-friendly Democrats and the Republican leadership from pushing through TPP by 2017.\n\nOther possible casualties of the GOP's big win this year are the U.S. Postal Service, Postal Service workers and their unions, and the federal workforce in general. As Melanie Trottman and Kris Maher reported in the Nov. 6 *Washington Post,* some labor observers are saying the election results \"could send a message to politicians that they can take on labor and survive,\" leading to \"more efforts to rein in public-employee pensions, curb collective-bargaining rights for federal workers, and push right-to-work laws that allow employees in unionized workplaces to opt out of paying union dues.\"\n\nFor federal workers and postal workers in general, the outlook seems especially grim. The new GOP chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee is Sen. Ron Johnson, a former plastics manufacturer from Wisconsin and a Tea Party Republican who issued an alarmist report on federal deficit reduction in 2011.\n\nAccording to a Nov. 10 *Post* article by Joe Davison, Johnson expects government deficit spending to total $127 trillion over the next 30 years. Johnson's 2011 report therefore recommended reducing the other federal workforce by 10 percent and cutting the number of federal contractors by 15 percent. In addition, Davidson reports, the report has suggested \"eliminating the Office of Special Counsel, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Office of Government Ethics and the Federal Labor Relations Authority, all of which deal directly with federal employees.\"\n\nDavidson's *Post* article further quotes the Senator as saying that \"I really don't think that the public-sector employees should be unionized,\" and as advocating that the Post Service should go through bankruptcy proceedings, which \"really would turn the post office into a private entity.\"\n\nGiven the reality of labor give-backs in the private sector over the years, where health-care and retirement benefits have been repeatedly reduced, Johnson has reportedly said it is \"unrealistic\" for public-sector employees to \"believe they are immune from modifications in their pay and benefit packages.\"\n\nAccording to Davidson's \"Federal Diary\" piece in the *Post,* Johnson is saying he will look for areas of bipartisan agreement in his committee, so his most extreme ideas on the federal workforce are unlikely to become law overnight. Yet his chairmanship of the committee does mean that federal employee unions will face a very challenging political environment when the new Congress convenes in January.\n\nStill another long-term challenge for progressives, democratic socialists and even moderate liberals that the new Congress will present lies in the area of presidential appointments, both to the federal bureaucracy and to the federal judiciary. Mainstream media commentators expect the Republicans to block many if not most Obama nominees to the federal courts, in particular, which could mean that conservative Republicans get to stack the entire federal court system with rightwing, business-friendly judges for decades to come.\n\nDuring the darkest days of the American Revolution, patriot Tom Paine wrote that \"these are the times that try men's souls.\" Paine should have added, \"and women's souls, too,\" or simply written \"human souls\" and had done with it, if he hadn't fallen pretty to the sexism of his times. But DSA members and other progressives in the United States, whether we're trying to work inside or outside of the Democratic Party and the electoral arena, ought to remember and embrace Paine's sentiment.\n\nFor democratic socialists, the inconvenient truth is that no matter how much we might have wished it otherwise, and no matter how differently Marx may have envisioned things turning out in 1848, the struggle for a humane and democratic socialism has been a long, hard slog that has lasted for more than a century now. In the more developed capitalist societies of Western Europe and the United States, there have been no sudden revolutionary breaks that led to success – at least not yet – and the mass of working people have yet to declare themselves all to be socialists.\n\nEspecially in advanced capitalist countries of the West, as Antonio Gramsci argued in his *Prison Notebooks,* the fight for socialism has become a \"war of position\" comparable to the grisly and endless trench warfare of World War I, not a \"war of movement\" comparable to some of Napoleon's lightning military strikes in the early 1800s. What socialists require to win a \"war of position,\" a la Gramsci's phrase, is a mixture of determination, movement-building and organization-building, plus the patience to keep fighting for decades.\n\nIn a war of position, as opposed to a war of movement, important battles may be lost, but the side that has the most determination, the best organization, and the most success in identifying and mobilizing resources has a long-term chance of winning the war. I think democratic socialists would do well to remember that as we face what could be a series of discouraging and defensive fights in the months and years ahead.","order":1},{"title":"Good Reads for Socialists, December 2014","date":"2014-12-01","issue":"December 2014","author":"","body":"The Black Friday demo at the H Street Walmart, including many from Jobs with Justice, as portrayed in words and pictures by the excellent blog *DCi*st: [*http://dcist.com/2014/11/protesters\\_gather\\_outside\\_dc\\_walmar.php*](http://dcist.com/2014/11/protesters_gather_outside_dc_walmar.php)\n\nHow much trouble are unions in after the 2014 election debacle?

Graylan Hagler, senior pastor of Plymouth United Church of Christ, an at-large City Council candidate in the recent plebiscite.\n\nHagler, an Independent candidate who came in behind several other Independents in a race won by Democrat Anita Bonds and Independent Elissa Silverman, pointed out that of around 100,000 votes cast in the crowded at-large Council race, \"60,000 were undervotes.\" Those voters, who could vote for two candidates because two seats were available, cast a vote for only one of the candidates. The Democratic establishment, he said, had called for a \"bullet vote\" to ensure that Bonds, an undistinguished legislator who had been appointed to a seat made vacant by a prosecution for corruption, would win an electoral victory.\n\nThe stakes in the race were illustrated, he said, by the comparative silence about the real issues in the campaign – housing, poverty and the need for a living wage, and gentrification. The decline of really *public* housing as both a concept and a concrete fact in the District is illustrated by Barry Farms. The Farms, originally a grant to newly freed slaves, is now a victim of the elite-managed cycle into profiteering and out of public hands. Public housing that is judiciously neglected by both government and its alleged private-sector allies becomes vulnerable to takeover and gentrification by the always-lurking private sector predators.\n\nHagler observed, for instance, that in areas targeted for redevelopment police protection was virtually absent until the developers started to buy up the property. Once they had the property, the police came back and cleaned up the neighborhood *before* any new development took place. Clearly this could have happened in a way that benefited the original occupants but it didn't.\n\nHagler recounted the dismantling of public housing as a program and an idea stemming from the 1992 imposition of a financial authority or \"Control Board\" on the District by Congress, punishing the voters for returning the recently-deceased Marion Barry, Jr. to the mayoralty after his drug conviction. Anthony Williams, director of the Control Board and Barry's successor as mayor, systematically turned over the city's affordable housing stock to the private sector for management and redevelopment, especially through land-assembly of contiguous vacant residences. A persistent joint strategy of government and developers was to allow communities and neighborhoods to deteriorate until they could be characterized as requiring redevelopment in order to save them.\n\n\"Racial politics are class politics,\" Hagler asserted, likening the business-based Federal City Council to a White Citizens Council that stays above the fray and leaves the dirty work to Klan-like elements. He observed that D.C., alone among Eastern seaboard cities from Boston to Richmond, had no neighborhoods that were poor *and* white.\n\nHagler contrasted that steady corporatization of the housing stock with the confrontational politics of the Community for Creative Nonviolence (CCNV), which in the 1980s advocated for the homeless with tactics that prefigured the Occupy movement (and had longer-lasting consequences and results).\n\nAsked how neighborhoods could be improved without gentrification, Hagler observed that organization for action was a prerequisite, along with exposure of the moneyed interests behind public policy.\n\nThe Socialist Salon is a monthly discussion meeting of Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America.

Going home, you see a careening SUV that knocks this waiter/bicyclist off the road. The film then has scenes from different personal views leading up to the tragedy. The views come from two families brought together by their children and their mutual lust for money. One family, led by a hedge fund manager, is quite well off but even for them the market fluctuates. The other father is looking to cash in on this new friendship with the rich family. Three different views bring in new relationships and you might not guess the ending. It is interesting that only one person in the film works, and he gets run over. *Human Capital* is a film of desire, greed, and the value of life in a community where finance capital propels people's lives and labor is disposable or an afterthought.\n\nThe film is very well done with superb acting, dialogue and plot. The director is Paolo Virzi, who has specialized in comedies but has now expanded to drama. This Italian film is drawn from an American book called *Human Capital: A Novel* by Stephen Amidon, who lives in New England and Italy. The book was highly acclaimed by the *Washington Post* in 2004. The book and the film's main technical flaw, according to some reviewers, is an inaccurate account of the mechanics of hedge funds and explanations of risk. However, these inaccuracies might have added to the drama and conflict of the film.\n\nThere are many definitions of \"human capital\" but the one identified in the film's credits is from the insurance industry and is used to quantify the potential earnings of a life. This meaning can be used in evaluating the value of a wrongful death and to identify the waiter's monetary loss to his family.\n\n\n\nThe film is to be released in February or sooner and some previews are already out.","order":4},{"title":"Living in Poverty: The Insider's View","date":"2014-12-01","issue":"December 2014","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Review of *Hand to Mouth: Living in Bootstrap America*. By Linda Tirado. G.P. Putnam's Sons, 2014. 196 pp.\n\n\n\nBarbara Ehrenreich's 2001 book *Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America* provided readers with a powerful, witty, first-hand look at the struggles of low-wage workers shut out of the American dream. And yet, as Ehrenreich took on the guise of a housecleaner or Walmart associate in order to gather material, I couldn't help yearning for the voice of a real low-wage worker to supplement that of Ehrenreich, who could resume her relatively comfortable life as a writer once her research was completed.\n\nNow we have such a voice: that of Linda Tirado. Her book *Hand to Mouth: Living in Bootstrap America*, is an alternately angry, funny, profane (often all of these at the same time) and always eloquent look at her own struggles trying to raise a family and stay one step ahead of bill collectors while lurching from one dead-end job to another. Tirado got \"discovered\" when she posted a pointed reply on an online forum to a query about why poor people often act in self-destructive ways. Her mini-essay went viral: It appeared in *The Nation, Forbes* and the *Huffington Post* and led to an offer to expand her thoughts into book form. (Ehrenreich, a DSA honorary chair, generously contributed the book's forward).\n\nTirado draws from her own experiences to illustrate why the cycle of poverty is so hard to break. Working two low-paying, part-time jobs, as Tirado has done, is a treadmill of driving, loss of sleep, absence from home and the constant fear that one of her employers will suddenly upset the juggling act by changing her schedule and forcing her to lose one of her jobs. Poor living conditions and poor diet make it harder to hold down any job while exacerbating health problems – which, even in Obamacare America, require funds that the poor often don't have. \"Poverty is fucking expensive,\" she says, and provides ample illustration of how the poor pay a premium for their poverty through interest on payday loans, lack of ready cash for economical bulk-buying, and other catch-22s seemingly designed to make the poor even poorer.\n\nThis being largely a personal account and not a policy analysis, Tirado is stronger on how the poor get that way – and get poorer – than what to do about alleviating poverty. But she does asks the non-poor to take the first step – to try to understand the poor and the difficulties they face rather than mindlessly criticize them as dysfunctional or irresponsible.\n\nPerhaps Tirado will encourage other low-wage Americans to come forward with their stories. Whether or not they do, *Hand to Mouth* is a powerful and valuable addition to understanding of the real barriers poor Americans face in their effort to break out of poverty.","order":5},{"title":"Metro DC DSA Plans for the Coming Year","date":"2014-12-01","issue":"December 2014","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"Members of Metro DC DSA's Steering Committee together with active members of the Local have decided to make the \"Fight for Fifteen,\" – the campaign for an across-the-board $15 minimum wage in our region – to be the priority for our work agenda in the coming year.\n\nThis decision was made by the 11 participants at a strategy committee meeting held on Sunday, November 23. Details of our work within the \"Fight for Fifteen\" campaign will be discussed and put to a membership vote in an early 2015 membership meeting. Other potential work in the coming year may include gathering signatures to encourage a potential Bernie Sanders presidential campaign and support for the initiatives of Jobs with Justice. We also will build on the relationships developed last year in local electoral activity through our endorsements of Andy Shallal for Mayor, and Rev. Graylan Hagler and Eugene Puryear for City Council in DC as well as the campaigns members took part in as individuals in suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nThe \"socialism,\" in our socialist activity will continue to be present in our work – as demonstrated in Seattle and elsewhere, the fight for a just, democratic public policy on incomes is socialist to the core. Our monthly Socialist Salons will continue to explore different aspects of socialist theory and practice, both at the local and at the national & international levels. Themes in the coming year will include – among other topics – socialist feminism, immigration struggles, the African-American radical tradition, and environmental justice. And the \"social\" nature of socialism will still be present through our once-a-month \"Happy Hours,\" which now includes a regular gathering in Northern Virginia in addition to the gathering held in DC. Our monthly online journal *Washington Socialist* will continue to bring these together by reporting on the work of the local and its members as well as providing a forum for \"think\" pieces on political, theoretical and cultural themes. Membership meetings will henceforth incorporate presentations on arenas of on-going or potential engagement. The local will conduct a survey early in 2015 to better determine the views, energy level and interests of all members, including those who pay dues but are not otherwise active.\n\nDiscussion at the strategy meeting also addressed the need to address members' concern with both national/international issues and local community struggles in order to better balance our work throughout the area – a breakdown of our 208 national DSA members locally indicates that 44 percent live in Maryland, 33 percent in DC proper, and 23 percent in Virginia. A report on national DSA helped place in context the work breakdown of the Local's activity last year and the contents of the *Washington* *Socialist* indicated what we already knew about the extensive work we have done. Written reports detailed the extensive activity Metro DC DSA engaged in last year as well as the wide-ranging themes addressed in the *Washington Socialist* – these providing a firm basis upon which to build for the future. Although the national political picture is bleak, the meeting was conducted in a spirit of hopefulness and the spirit of determination to do our part in bringing about much needed change to our society.","order":6},{"title":"Progressive Maryland Faces Political Challenges, Expands Suburban Md.

Arguing for renewed organizing starting now, Stafford said \"we can't just wait for another election.\"\n\nProgressive Maryland will resume the fight for paid sick leave for all workers (twice turned down the legislature) as well as reforms to eliminate tax loopholes enjoyed by out-of-state corporations and reversing the weakening of the estate tax. Also on the agenda: a redistricting commission, a continuing battle to reverse the Citizens United decision and a concurrent fight for public financing in state elections.\n\nMetro Washington Labor Council President Jos Williams fired up the crowd with his statement that with the election of Republican Larry Hogan to the governorship, \"the \\[deep Blue Maryland\\] bubble was burst\" and the task now is \"reclaiming our state.\"\n\nWaybright said that the Republican victory \"will make our work a little more difficult\" but suggested it could increase participation as well. Stafford, introducing himself with an account of how a supportive, active government had enabled him to get an education despite a tough background, warned \"there are forces that are trying to take all of that back.\"\n\nProgressive Maryland counts 23,000-plus individual members and 30 affiliated organizations and has offices in Silver Spring and Baltimore. Eleven union locals, the DC Building and Construction Trades Council, the state and two county NAACP organizations, several peace and justice organizations, Maryland NOW and several religiously based social justice groups are among the organizational affiliates.","order":7},{"title":"Sleep and Accept or Awake and Sing: Performing Clifford Odets Today","date":"2014-12-01","issue":"December 2014","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"**Theatre as Past**\n\nKnowing the end point of a given historical process can make the outcome of prior social developments appear inevitable; the choices left unfulfilled along the way dismissed as irrelevant or marginal. Yet that assumes history has an end point, ignoring the reality that existing relationships are themselves in a constant state of flow. Progress may look to have been inevitable for those whose family trajectory took a path out of poverty and toward comparative prosperity, family stability, a settled state of being; the conflicts of Depression-era life may appear to belong to a different world or be the fate of others less fortunate (or less worthy). The truth that such apparent gains may prove hollow, or that setbacks to challenges of political or social conventions from one period may provide the soil for subsequent re-emergence of such challenges — the truth that settled \"facts\" may be far from settled — is then lost. Whether the past is depicted as frozen or as still full of life are alternatives that can be set before us in the theatre, rendering revivals pointed or pointless.\n\nAs was the case with the just-closed Olney Theatre production in Montgomery County of Clifford Odets' 1935 play, *Awake and Sing*. Groundbreaking in its day, the challenge for the director and cast was to give it a contemporary relevance. It was a challenge not met; what the audience saw was a museum piece. Perhaps providing a glimpse of a life those in attendance recalled from their own now-distant childhood or heard in stories their parents or grandparents told, the performance allowed, encouraged, a sweet feeling of memory for times gone by, pleasurable even when watching painful scenes. Enjoyable, certainly, moving at times, but far removed from the anger that comes through in every line of dialogue as written. Efforts were made in the stage setting and display of artifacts throughout the building to be true to the original significance of the play and locate it historically; the attempts fell flat because of a superficial view of history that presents the past in one-dimensional terms. A superficial view encapsulated by the notion that relevance comes by depicting the family drama as \"timeless,\" thereby rendering it meaningless as all family dramas (on stage, in life) take place in time. In consequence, nothing in the production spoke to the emotional impact it had on audiences in the 1930s, no attempt was made to have an equivalent impact on audiences today.\n\n**Past as Prologue**\n\nSocial conflicts reached a high-water mark in the US in the years leading up to World War I. The war and its aftermath left many of the radical hopes contained in political movements of the time unfulfilled, replaced by a celebration of individualism, \"Americanism,\" the culture of celebrity and the worship of material gain — even though millions were left behind in this supposed march of progress. A questioning of the emptiness and pain contained in all the glitter gave rise to a rebirth of critical writing during the 1920s. This was what underlined the rejection of such \"progress\" by those who went off to Paris — Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Kay Boyle, John Dos Passos, H.D.. to name but a few; it was behind the bitter realism of writers like Sinclair Lewis, Dorothy Parker, Ring Lardner, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Stephen Vincent Benet, William Carlos Williams; behind the upsurge of the Harlem Renaissance and the work of Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larsen, James Weldon Johnson and many more.\n\nUnlike in previous periods, the theatre joined the other arts in giving voice to suppressed or ignored truths. Up the early 20th century, American stage had primarily offered works derivative of European models or provided uncritical comic/melodramatic entertainment without pretense to anything deeper. Pioneering plays by Maxwell Anderson, Laurence Stallings, Susan Glaspell, and, most significantly, Eugene O'Neill, brought life to drama, depicting the intersection of personal/family conflict in the context of societal tensions thereby providing a critique of the oppressions contained in everyday life. All this was in the air when the Depression brought the illusion of endless paths toward prosperity to a screeching halt, and set a framework that allowed the best of the new writing to connect individual fate with social conditions while engaging in the search to find hope where hopelessness was all around.\n\nAnd perhaps none did so more effectively than Clifford Odets, who breathed in the air of 1920s literary and theatrical developments alongside the conventions of Yiddish theatre — where melodrama and comedy were used to depict the tension between tradition as self-protection and tradition as self-repression, in the process expressing the inner-tension of immigrant life. Odets combined these various currents in *Awake and Sing* via its depiction of tenement family life, in its telling a story through conversation in everyday speech, in its rootedness amongst the Jewish poor (it was the first Broadway play with exclusively Jewish cast). By combining the various currents of theatrical and literary innovation, that rootedness did not isolate the Jewish immigrant experience as singular; rather, it allowed for points of connection, as other immigrants, other audiences, could hear the language of their lives and conflicts. Though such techniques and subject matter were to become staples on and off Broadway in following decades, it was new in Odets time — new to commercial theatre, and because of showing the political in the personal, new to radical theatre in the US; mirroring forms of expression adopted by dramatists such as O'Casey in Ireland, Brecht in Germany, Tretyakov in the Soviet Union.\n\n**The Play**\n\nThe setting of the story told is the Bronx apartment of an impoverished family fearful of losing what little they have, while each member dreams different dreams of a way up and forward. Caught between ideals of socialism that seem unable to compete with the allure of glamour and wealth that Hollywood and magazine advertising suggest capitalism can offer; caught between the lure of success defined by material goods and the reality of a scramble every day simply to make ends meet, anger becomes a weapon against surrender into passivity. The world Odets depicts is anything but benign; all the characters are living a life where a precarious security holding the wolf at bay is purchased at tremendous cost. A cost paid in a bitterness that trumps love. Children and marriage are seen as enormous burdens, especially marriage that doesn't help move the family up the economic ladder. Women are the chief victims of that process, marriage in such a context being depicted as nearly the respectable side of forced prostitution, a vehicle to move even one small notch up the ladder, a means to prevent sliding down further. Powerless when facing the world outside, power is exercised by a cruelty in family life, a cruelty that stems from crushed dreams and reflects the necessity of implacability against the outside currents of instability. Life as lived by those characters and, by extension, to the audiences who first responded to the performances on stage, calls for passion not charity's compassion.\n\nAdding to the power of the play, as written, was its indictment of an older generation who were charged with having given in to those pressures. The generational anger evident in every scene is central — and how could it not be? For the Depression's young people, the bust following the boom greeting them as they reached adulthood was laid at the door of their parents' and grandparents' defeats, illusions, failure. With all doors closed to those just starting out on life's journey, that anger should have been palpable — yet was a conflict lost in the Olney production because it conflicted with the nostalgia of the performance (for nostalgia softens memory – familial or historical – and so softens a sense of pain). Odets' indictment is not one-sided; he makes clear why the older generation acted as they did, why the mother makes harsh choices that hurt those she is trying to protect, rejects the socialism that she sees as simply another encumbrance in a life already filled with wasted sacrifice. The indictment is also political; the grandfather in the play is a socialist, a reader of Marx, a militant who despairs as he sees his children and grandchildren enticed by dreams of material gain. Yet, he indicts himself too, his words have little meaning because his socialism became abstracted from life, a socialism of dreams removed from action, a socialism undone by the too many personal compromises along the road – and so he has become a useless old man, with old dreams that do not speak to this new world. Taking comfort only in listening to records of Italian opera sung by Enrico Caruso, he has refused risk.\n\nReal change, for Odets however, involves real risk – when the granddaughter in the play abandons her child and \"arranged\" husband for a relationship of choice, there is no assumption that those choices will lead to happiness. Instead, her acts are an assertion that personal meaning can only be found by willingness to act cognizant of cost. Costs willingly accepted are the only path out of the personal surrender that leads to desperation manifested by lashing out at those near and dear. So too, when the grandson decides to stay his ground and resist by organizing, he both is and is not following in the grandfather's footsteps; for him socialism is a means to act, not dream. Odets that is, was trying to challenge his audience, to make his theatre-goers feel uncomfortable and question their own choices/compromises, just as his earlier play, *Waiting for Lefty*, was aimed at challenging audience passivity.\n\n**Present as Prologue**\n\nAnd contemporary theatre is still capable of doing the same. Two performances in the 2013-2014 season at Washington DC's Woolly Mammoth theatre provide examples, witness the appropriately long-named work by Jackie Sibblies Drury: *We Are Proud to Present: A Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as South-West Africa, From the German Sudwestafrika, Between the Years 1884-1915*. The fully scripted play is performed by six actors — three men, three women — as though an improvisational exercise in how to tell a story, how to stage a story. Doing so, each confronts the others and the lies, myths and exercises in avoidance that most people use to escape discomfort — especially when race is the subject. The characters, nameless throughout, have only the letters of German soldiers home — banal letters, filled with trivialities — to tell the story of the genocide. No written records from the slaughtered Herero people exist, therefore accounts of what took place — even empathetic or sympathetic accounts — come from outside the experience.\n\nWhen victims are not allowed to tell their own stories, the tragedies they undergo are not seen for themselves — a point brought home when one actor's claim that what happened in Southwest Africa was a precursor to the Holocaust is challenged in anger. The pain of oppression wrought in colonial Africa was awful enough in its own terms without having to be compared to the pain suffered in Europe. Similarly, when one (white) character attempts to demonstrate sensitivity by speaking about a painful family memory of witnessed racist violence, he is upbraided; it is not his painful memory that is relevant, but that of the victims. The barbs the actors throw at each other are barbs thrown at the audience, the conversation on stage about stories and truth, about written records and collective memories, about \"plays\" and history come back again and again — telling the story of the past to regain impact or telling stories to avoid uncomfortable realities. The seeming improvisational telling of the play adds to this, indicating how conversations can move past each other, unintentionally reproducing the prejudices of society that lead double standards in everyday life to go unheard. Linking all is the recognition of how the experience of racism colors the way the past is seen. And not just the past: the play was staged in the wake of Trayvon Martin's murder and conversation was encouraged to grapple with the meaning of George Zimmerman's acquittal.\n\nMike Daisey's ***American Utopias***, also performed at the Woolly, directly moves from the world on stage to a confrontation to the world outside. Daisey's one-man show begins as a running commentary on his personal experience joining in two versions of American utopia. He takes part in the countercultural Burning Man festival in Nevada, a celebration of self-reliance in community that allows a brief moment of escape from the everyday world of work and bills and order, a world all will rejoin immediately thereafter. He next narrates a family trip to Disney World with its vision of order and place created by turning dreams into commodities, Utopia as something that can be stage-managed through masks and play, as something the market can offer for sale. Sarcastic and cutting about these two, Daisey challenges illusions and self-conceits people bring to them. Though he tempers that, he also offers an homage to the honesty many bring to these, their respective sense of belief and striving toward a means of belonging. Daisey condemns the lacks, economic and social, not the various searches for a truer life, however misguided they might be.\n\nAnd that leads to his contrast with a more pointed Utopia: Occupy Wall Street, a utopia that challenged the system at its roots and so was judged a menace to be crushed. His sympathy and solidarity with those who took part is balanced by his own inability to commit, for unlike Burning Man or Disney World, he did not join in. Failing to turn beliefs into action, Daisey did not set foot in Zuccotti Park, and so, like many good people ever and again, standing on the sidelines allowed reaction to regain the upper hand. Thus Daisy turns his non-involvement into a self-indictment, an indictment made all the more real when he spoke of the beatings and arrests suffered by those who took part, his commentary on police violence enhanced by video images of the Park being forcibly cleared.\n\nNon-involvement, watching from the sidelines, is itself a form of complicity — a washing of hands, an acceptance rationalized by the belief that nothing can be done — thus his self-indictment becomes a shared indictment with those in his audience who similarly observed and did nothing. A point he drew home during his performance, by leading people outside the theatre and — from a street corner — urging theatre-goers to break down the gap between good thoughts, staged performances, and the world of oppression and repression, urging each to take action to reclaim public space, take risks, act to change our world.\n\n**Past, Present and Future Choices**\n\nWhich brings us back to *Awake and Sing*. One means to recapture the spirit of the play would be to put it in the setting of an immigrant family in the United States of today; for the world is similarly exploitative to those who live at the margins now as compared to then. The difficulty, however, would be to avoid the distancing — the seeing of other's pain only in terms of them being the other, only in terms of pain. Here one can recall Richard Wright's self-critique of his first collection of short stories, *Uncle Tom's Children* — for they were stories that made readers weep from afar. And so he followed it with *Native Son*, which doesn't allow its central character to turn into an object of unalloyed sympathy. Rather the honesty of its picture forces readers to confront rather than patronize. The novel's central character Bigger Thomas is trapped in a world defined by poverty and racism; the link to most of those who read the novel is not his world of limitations, it is a shared sense of limitation, of walls and barriers, that define the life of most. It is a claustrophobia experienced by all characters in *We Are Proud to Present*..., a claustrophobia Daisey brought home in the telling of the ring around Zuccotti Park as the police charged.\n\nTrapped by student debt, trapped by jobs with no security, trapped by a system that still offers no sense of belonging apart from that which can be bought by wealth is today's reality; Occupy spoke to that sense and so touched a nerve that allowed it so spread so swiftly. And that sense of claustrophobia, of tenement life, of life without choices and possibilities, rings true in every line in Odets play and is why it touched a nerve of recognition in its day — and could in our day too. Claustrophobia is bred by the closed doors of our winner-take-all system with no way out. The competition at the root of capitalism engenders a permanent state of insecurity that enables other forms of injustice to thrive, that encourages a live for today not tomorrow mindset. That insecurity can set jobs against health and the environment, can welcome job growth in the form of prison expansion and overseas war. Today's radicalism is as much a search for meaning as it is for social justice as it is for economic justice — at once, the same and different from strivings in the past.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with a work of theatre aimed at giving an audience pleasure, nothing wrong with enjoying an evening's performance as a form of relaxation and leaving it as that. Yet there is also nothing wrong with a theatre production, with any work of art, making its audience work. Perhaps it is only our alienation from work itself that makes it difficult for many to connect pleasure on a night out and being challenged to think and act. It is a connection, however, as central to artistic values that challenge conventional wisdom as it is to political movements that similarly push against the limits of what is deemed possible, deemed acceptable. Intersecting political and cultural challenges, celebrating work and critical thought, is the best way to keep hope alive in our troubled times.\n\nOdets lived out the choices, the risks, thrown at his audience in his early plays. Eventually leaving New York for Hollywood, he found material success, but though he produced good writing in his later years, nothing matched his early brilliance — he lost his connection with his audience and was unable to re-establish a new one. So too, the risk of political engagement caught up with him. Angry at McCarthyism, defiant in words, he eventually gave in and testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Unlike others who did so, however, Odets did not justify himself. According to most accounts, he died a broken man trapped by the system he hated. It is a story that gives more, not less, meaning to *Awake and Sing*, for it foreshadows the difficult road any would have to follow to escape the impositions of a heartless system. Trying and failing is far more meaningful than a life of non-engagement, for its leaves in its wake a legacy upon which others can build. That is the meaning of the grandfather's admonition which we fail to heed at a cost:\n\n\"That is why I tell you — Do! Do what is in you.

Julia Kann, until recently on the staff of MWCLC President Jos Williams and now with *Labor Notes*, was the public face, ably assisted by Mark Brenner and the New York staff.\n\nKann and Williams opened the morning plenary with a welcome, Kann noting that Washington, DC \"the only unionization to come out of \"Fight for $15\" \\[the minimum wage campaign\\] was in D.C.\" And Williams urged \"if you want to change American society so that justice is simply something that we automatically do... be a troublemaker.\"\n\nThere were morning breakout sessions on Secrets of a Successful Organizer, Know Your Rights on the Job, Assertive Grievance Handling, and Fighting Privatization.DSA members Colson Breen, Monica Owens,Dave Richardson and Woody Woodruff attended the Troublemakers School and scattered to different workshops. \"Privatization is a major issue for my union, American Federation of Government Employees, so I attended \\[that\\] one,\" Richardson said. Presenters Kewana Battle-Mason and Jackie Jeter from the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), and Rich Shelley of the American Postal Workers Union were facilitated by Samantha Winslow of Labor Notes, who also pinch hit for the Washington Teachers Union (WTU). \"The Postal Workers seem to me to be putting up the best fight, picketing Staples all over the country over the opening of post offices in Staples stores staffed by private, Staples employees,\" Richardson observed. On Friday, November 14, as the culmination of a long series of actions, they had a raucous demonstration at Postal Service HQ here in Washington, and at the end of the day embattled Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe announced his \"retirement.\" Shelley also focused on Congress's discriminatory requirement that the Postal Service, unlike any other public-private entity, fully fund employee pensions for the distant future – resulting in paper losses, \"phony numbers,\" for an enterprise that actually continues to make a profit.\n\nOf other public-sector unions, ATU president Jeter outlined the threat to public transit as an increasing number of Metrobus routes were eliminated in favor of Circulator routes designed for affluent areas and employing poorly paid non-union workers with little experience and training. Battle-Mason recounted similar problems with private companies contracted to provide public transit, trimming costs by cutting wages and using poorly maintained vehicles. Battle-Mason had provided similar evidence to a Socialist Salon late in 2013 and it was clear little had changed.\n\nWinslow focused on the need for educators to forge community ties and gave as an example the Chicago Teachers Union strike of the past year, a significant victory against an overreaching Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Chicago's teachers successfully communicated to the public what they were bargaining over, and \"they built those relationships in advance.\"\n\nJeter summed up: Although public sector unions were most under attack now, \"all unions have to start talking collectively about privatization.\"\n\nJos Williams wrapped the session with the admonition that the work ahead required internal union education – \"understand the issue and be committed\" – as well as organizing with other unions to achieve overarching solidarity and mobilizing the community. \"This is going to take discipline,\" he argued, so \"think like an army.\" There ensued a lively discussion in which Richardson, a board member of Jobs with Justice, was vigorously applauded for his statement that it was time for AFGE to resign its seat on the Democratic National Committee both in order to effectively lobby a Republican Congress but also because the Democrats have failed in their supposed goals of passing progressive legislation and of keeping the Republicans out. \"Of course they \\[Democrats\\] have prevented the Republicans from illegally contracting out civilian employees at DoD, by contracting them out themselves. They have also prevented the Republicans from imposing a wage freeze on Federal employees, by imposing a wage freeze themselves. In a similar vein they have prevented the Republicans from starting another losing war in the Middle East, keeping the country in an interminable recession by NOT passing a big enough economic stimulus package, and keeping Guantanamo open.\" The afternoon featured workshops on Creative Tactics, Beating Apathy, Community-Labor Alliances, and Organizing Across Borders, which seem to have been well-received despite an old friend admitting that she fell asleep during the Apathy session. The Community-Labor session featured speakers from JwJ, WTU, and ATU.\n\nAgain there was a lively discussion as all the participants and attendees realized that Labor can't win in this climate without broad community support. DC JwJ director Nikki Lewis observed that unions had a real struggle reaching the community in \"the hyper-transactional capitalist culture.\" Still, she said, victories came after defeats. The Large Retailer Accountability Act, which would have tamed Walmart's low-wage approach, passed the Council but was vetoed by the mayor. But, she said, it broke conceptual ground with the community's consciousness that led to the successful passage of minimum wage hikes in the District. \"The success story that stuck with me,\" Richardson said, \"was that, on day four (of nine) in the Chicago teachers' strike last year, 56 percent of the residents trusted the teachers to do the right thing regarding education while only 36 percent trusted Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\"\n\n\"For those of us, liberals, progressives, and racial minorities as well as socialists, for whom the political system doesn't work, *Labor Notes* and the Troublemakers School offers a different direction,\" said Richardson. \"By focusing on organizing at work and in our communities, it is an attempt to bypass the 'two capitalist party system' in favor of organizing from below for of our rights and our economic well-being.\""},{"title":"Can the Left Regain the Support Of the White Working Class?","date":"2014-04-02","issue":"April 2014","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"Book Review of Andrew Levison: *The White Working Class Today: Who They Are, How They Think and How Progressives Can Regain Their Support, Democratic Strategist Press, 201 pages.*\n\nSince Marx coined the phrase in the 1840s, socialists have urged the \"workers of the world\" to unite despite national and other differences. Here in the United States, labor activists have often found it damnably difficult to follow this wonderful advice. At certain times and in certain places, American radical organizations like the old IWW and the Communist Party in its \"Popular Front\" days have won remarkable – though temporary – successes in getting workers to unite across lines of religion, race, national origin, and even (to a lesser degree) sexual and gender differences. But under other circumstances, racist and nativist movements and clashing religious beliefs have led many American workers to support reactionary politicians who lent credence to the famous boast of 19th century robber baron Jay Gould: \"I can hire half the working class to kill the other half.\"\n\nToday, some historically important barriers to working class unity in this country seem to have fallen, or at least abated, as demonstrated by the strikingly multi-racial and cross-cultural coalition that supported Barack Obama's 2008 presidential run. Still, the 2008 Obama campaign only won the backing of 40 percent of white working class voters. Two years later, in the 2010 midterm elections, white workers gave the Democrats just 33 percent of their votes, while the Tea Party surged and the Republicans recaptured the House of Representatives.\n\nAs 2014 midterm elections approach, can progressive or even moderate Democrats enjoy enough white working-class voters to keep control over the Senate? Or will the disaffection of these voters in conjunction with widespread political gerrymandering help to give the Senate, too, back to the Republicans? And over a much longer term, can the left either inside or outside of the Democratic Party ever win a majority of working class whites to the ideals of democratic socialism??\n\nIn *The White Working Class Today*, progressive researcher Andrew Levison makes a case that liberal and moderate Democrats, at least, can indeed regain the support of many working class whites, whom Levison defines generally as white workers with no more than a high school education who are employed in a wide spectrum of occupational categories doing basically blue-collar labor.\n\nLevison argues further that progressives urgently need to regain the allegiance of such workers, for in his view, working-class whites constitute one of the most important groups of swing voters in US politics. Although the nation's changing demography means whites command a steadily dwindling population majority, and are projected to become a minority in a few decades, it will be many years before progressives can afford to write off the approximately 31.7 million white men and estimated 12 million – 20 million white women (the numbers depend on how certain intermediate jobs are counted) who currently earn their livings from working class occupations.\n\nIf white working class support for Democrats falls back to 33 percent in the presidential election of 2016, Levison warns, if it merely matches what occurred in 2010, the country could see a Republican president in 2017 – a disaster for American progressives and the many different causes we represent.\n\nIn *The White Working Class Today*, Levison draws on a wealth of opinion polling data and around six dozen scholarly studies of working class life to inform readers about how white workers as a group have changed since the 1950s and how progressives need to understand their values and circumstances in order to communicate with them. His conclusion is that moderate progressives can find ways to appeal to these workers, but not through exactly the same kinds of rhetoric that might have worked with unionized factory workers in, say, the industrial heartland a few decades ago.\n\nLevison's polling data offers much less hope for socialists, at least for the immediate future. One key finding is that for the most part, white working class Americans are cultural traditionalists who strongly support evangelical and mainstream Christian churches, the US military and capitalist \"free enterprise\" as they understand it. They are deeply cynical about government as an institution and indeed harbor intense anger towards it; and they have little remaining belief in Keynesian deficit spending as a stimulus for economic growth.\n\nHowever, Levison argues, white working class support for \"free enterprise,\" which some surveys put in the range of 80 percent or more, primarily reflects admiration for small business, which accounts for an increasing important fraction of working class jobs in the wake of large-scale corporate layoffs and the flight of factory jobs overseas. Many formerly unionized factory workers also have been forced by circumstances to become small contractors in the construction business, and have thus themselves become small business owners. As such, they often hire close friends and associates who are known to be skilled, hard workers in order to form teams that can compete successfully for jobs on residential and non-residential construction projects.\n\nConsequently, workers in the construction business often lack the hostile feeling towards \"the boss\" that might have been common in unionized factories as recently as the 1970s. Rhetoric about class warfare has little appeal to them, and they do favor free-market capitalism as small business owners practice it.\n\nHowever, white workers have far more negative feelings about large corporations, especially in the communities of the so-called Rust Belt, and many feel great anger over corporations' destroying large numbers of American jobs through layoffs, factory relocations, automation and outsourcing.\n\nOne reason that hatred for government has almost become a kind of \"new class consciousness\" among white workers, Levison notes, is that they believe – accurately – that the government and the political system at large have been captured by corporate money and corporate lobbying power.\n\nWhite workers also perceive – again accurately – that the corporations along with the super-wealthy are able to get out of paying their fair share in taxes. And while the workers are angry at upper-class greed, they are even more furious with politicians and the government for letting it go unchecked. This offers potential hope to progressives and socialists working on, say, measures to raise taxes on the wealthy or to overturn the Supreme Court's \"Citizens United\" ruling, since making the corporations play by the rules is something many white workers favor.\n\nLevison adds, however, that the data show many white workers also hating and distrusting government because of irksome regulations it has placed on small businesses, because it sometimes champions such \"alien\" values as racial affirmative action, and because they see government as being corrupt and generally ineffective. Given these circumstances, white working class Americans generally reject Keynesian deficit spending, seeing simply it as a matter of government being undisciplined and running out of control. They don't see how deficit spending might help to create jobs, and they worry about the government's debts being inherited by their grandchildren.\n\nOn the other hand, polling data suggests that with the exception of a hard core of conservative \"true believers,\" accounting for about 25 percent of white workers, most working class whites believe that pure unregulated markets are unworkable, and that government must sometimes intervene to correct the market's mistakes. A majority of white workers apparently also support government investment in the future health of the country.\n\nThus a 2011 survey by the progressive group Democracy Corps found that 57 percent of those who answered favored \"a plan to invest in new industries and rebuild the country over the next five years,\" while at the same time 52 percent supported \"a plan to dramatically reduce the deficit over the next five years.\" When asked about the government both cutting the deficit and \"making growth-producing investments in American industry and small business,\" 57 percent of white working class respondents were in favor.\n\nThe numbers suggest that when President Obama, to the fury of many socialists, proposed a few years ago to cut the federal budget while simultaneously having the government support various measures to help the middle class, he was probably on sound political grounds. To intellectuals on the left, the economics of Obama's position were contradictory and self-defeating, but to many white working class voters that Obama and the Democrats needed to attract, they may have seemed like common sense.\n\nThere are a wealth of other findings in this book that also may be of practical and/or theoretical interest to progressive readers. For example, Levison points out that widespread support for the Army among white workers is likely based on the fact that since the end of the draft, the Army in its front-line troops has become an overwhelmingly working-class institution. White workers thus tend to view controversies over military issues from the perspective of front-line troops. Generally this means they need to believe that \"the Armed Forces are doing the right thing.\"\n\nHowever, among white workers there is an important split between those who believe in the military imposing American values on other societies by force and \"a cautious view that wants to avoid foreign wars unless genuinely necessary for the security of the United States.\" Thus an unpublished survey from 2010 found 47 percent of the respondents favoring a gradual drawdown of US troops in Afghanistan and just 46 percent wanting the US to \"stay the course and finish the job in Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe divisions within the white working class over the more extreme forms of US militarism echo what Levison finds about attitudes toward several other issues of interest to liberals and progressives. On many questions, a significant minority or even a majority of white workers favor the right wing option. However, a small minority of these workers are progressives themselves, and a significant fraction of moderate swing voters occupy the political middle. Liberals can reach many of these voters in the middle and get them to support progressive positions, Levison argues. But this is possible only through arguments that appeal to the workers' common sense and by avoiding angry or dogmatic rhetoric in favor of a balanced, \"on the one hand, on the other hand\" approach to discussing the issues.\n\nFor example, the polling data indicate strong support for religion among working class whites; however, a majority do not support an exclusive form of Christianity that finds all other religions to be suspect. Similarly, while a large majority of white evangelical Protestants surveyed a few years ago strongly opposed both homosexuality and abortion, almost a third of the evangelicals polled said homosexuals should be accepted by American society, and 26 percent favored the legality of abortion in \"most\" circumstances. To recruit support for progressive politics among white workers, Levison concludes, Democrats need to recruit these moderate swing voters.\n\nTurning to immigration, another hot-button issue, Levison's data found large majorities of working class whites opposed to \"illegal\" immigration, and deeply offended by the notion of immigrants breaking the law to enter the US. Many working class whites also believe that an irresponsible government is giving favored treatment to undocumented immigrants – in terms of welfare payments, for example – and find this outrageous. A substantial number of anti-immigration respondents also have viciously racist feelings against Latinos, Levison states; he doesn't specify just what fraction.\n\nYet there are contradictory feelings of empathy for individual immigrants among some working class people who oppose undocumented immigrants as a group. Many white workers who have worked alongside immigrants in the construction industry also express admiration for their hard work and loyalty to family – both crucial values for working class whites. When given the choice by pollsters, Levison notes, most working class whites want tougher border enforcement\" and an eventual path to citizenship for immigrants – an arguably contradictory stance that angers many immigrant rights activists, but one the Obama administration is apparently echoing.\n\nTo gain significant support among white working class voters, Levison concludes, progressives need to pay careful heed to the political divisions within this group, then use balanced, common-sense appeals to win the moderate middle fraction of these workers to basically tolerant positions. What progressives must not do, he argues, is take the basically arrogant tone that liberal author Thomas Frank, for example, used a decade ago in *What's the Matter with Kansas?* (2004). In that book Frank suggested that Kansas voters were being seduced by merely cultural politics into ignoring their \"real\" self-interest, which Frank portrayed as almost exclusively economic. If progressives want support from white working class Americans, Levison argues, we actually need to listen to what they think is important, and find ways to respond to it.\n\nThe points above are only a few highlights of what recent research as Levison recounts it shows about white working class attitudes. The book also has intriguing things to say about the differing political implications of Christian radio and country music radio, for instance, and some detailed discussion of the rather complex attitudes that white workers bring to politics and economics. A few ambitious chapters focus on how progressive groups, like the AFL-CIO's associate group Working America, can best do outreach to moderates and even a few Republicans in the working class. The book also offers sobering evidence about white working class attitudes toward most college-educated professional workers, whom many working class respondents portray as as \"cold,\" \"arrogant\" and overly obsessed with money and career at the expense of family.\n\nHow democratic socialists should or will respond to Levison's findings is probably a matter for debate. Meanwhile, many readers will probably notice one huge hole in Levison's documentation of white working class attitudes. Except for a few brief remarks about immigration, and except for noting that white workers in the South are generally much more conservative than those elsewhere, Levison includes virtually no data about how white workers today think about race and racism, especially relating to African Americans. This is unbelievably large omission for any serious study of how white Americans of any class think about society. With that caveat, however, *The White Working Class Today* seems like a careful examination of the attitudes that a critical part of the US electorate brings to politics. It should be of interest to many DSA members.","order":0},{"title":"Crossing the River to the Future: Heartbreak and Hope in the 'Tallest Tree in the Forest'","date":"2014-04-02","issue":"April 2014","author":"Kurt Stand","body":"Slavery is a word simple to say, yet a concept difficult to grasp – owning another human being, owning someone's children for life, being able to sell people on the market like cattle and doing so publicly with an air of moral acceptability; it all speaks to the abject cruelty that is a part of our country's origins. That slavery – racial slavery — was a central feature of the birth and development of the United States makes the inequality and level of division and distrust it fostered that much harder to overcome. And while slavery is in the past, its continuing impact on our society is a reminder that this past is not so very distant.\n\nPaul Robeson was the son of a slave, a reality important to remember if his full measure as a human being and as an advocate for peace and justice is to be grasped. For the nature of that struggle, the vision of a democratic heritage and a possible democratic future that was embodied within his life, is a reminder that beauty and love, equality and justice are part of our past and can be our future too. We lose much if all we remember of the past is defeat and suffering. The quality of resistance can create its own bonds that counter oppression by embracing the worth of each. Robeson writes of this in his autobiography, *Here I Stand*:\n\n\"It was in Britain – among the English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish people of that land – that I learned that the essential character of a nation is determined not by the upper classes, but by the common people, and that the common people of all nations are truly brothers in the great family of mankind. If in Britain there were those who lived by plundering the colonial peoples, there were also the many millions who earned their bread by honest toil. And even as I grew to feel more Negro in spirit, or African as I put it then, I also came to feel a sense of oneness with the white working people whom I came to know and love.\n\n\"This belief in the oneness of humankind about which I have often spoken in concerts and elsewhere, has existed within me side by side by side with my deep attachment to the cause of my own race. ... I do not think, however, that my sentiments are contradictory; and in England I learned that there truly is a kinship among us all, a basis for mutual respect and brotherly love. \" (pp 56-57).\n\nThe varied sides of Robeson's conviction – pride in being black, in his African roots, his sense of connection with all working people irrespective of race or nationality, joined by his opposition to those who live by off the labor of others – are given voice in the *The Tallest Tree in the Forest*. A one-man tour de force, written and performed by Daniel Beaty, it was staged at the Arena Stage this winter. The play's narrative is a series of flashbacks, with Robeson as an old man, wounded in spirit and physically frail, looking back on his life of achievement and commitment. Beaty enacts in one scene the two influences upon Robeson as a child that he would unite as an adult: the brother who physically resists racism even in a time when lynching was not unknown, and his father who taught him the classics so that he could make the heritage of the world's learning his own\n\nRobeson went on to be a star athlete at Rutgers in the 1920s, when a black athlete allowed to play college football was still a rarity. He then went to law school at Columbia – but the law profession held no future for him when neither a white judge nor white clients would listen to a black lawyer. But it was the era of the Harlem Renaissance, and Robeson, who had grown up hearing and singing spirituals, found his calling in the songs he sang; his outstanding voice infused his music with the spirit of resistance and hope. Beaty sings Robeson's songs powerfully, allowing us to grasp their yearnings. Robeson's explanation of one such song's meaning is especially poignant:\n\n> From the days of chattel slavery until today, the concept of travel > has been inseparably linked in the minds of our people with the > concept of freedom. Hence, the symbol of a railroad train recurs > frequently in our folklore – in spirituals and gospel songs, in blues > and ballads – and the train is usually \"bound for glory,\" and \"heading > for the Promised Land.\" And there are boats, too, like the \"old Ship > of Zion\" and the \"Old Ark\" that will take us over the waters to > freedom and salvation.\n\nPoignant for those words were written when Robeson – like W.E.B. DuBois — had his passport lifted and was denied the right to travel. Even in the McCarthy era there were no grounds to charge him at trial, so the blacklist imposed at home was reinforced by denying his right to go abroad where people were willing and eager to hear him perform.\n\nPoignant and political. During Robeson's travels abroad in the 1930s he achieved a success and stature not yet possible in the still deeply segregated United States. Encouraged and supported – and prodded and cajoled – by his wife Eslanda Goode Robeson he became an actor as well; the limited roles open to him on Broadway were greatly expanded on the London stage. And during the dozen years abroad his inchoate sense of rebellion and assertion of dignity in the face of the unrelieved racism of US society was given a political content. His encounters with Welsh miners, engaged in their own resistance to poverty and degradation through collective action and through song, became a pathway to understanding the oneness of all people's search for dignity. A trip to Germany enabled him to see the face of fascism – the face of the mob manipulated by the powerful in assaults on Communists, socialists and unionists, on artists and those who don't fit in, and on Jews. Robeson's deep hatred of racism led him to a strong affinity with Jewish determination to resist anti-Semitism, a bond that would last his whole life.\n\nHe went to Spain during the civil war; he saw in the Spanish people's resistance to fascism, saw in the international brigades of volunteers taking up arms to defend liberty, a model of the brotherhood of resistance all peoples fighting for a true democracy he sought for in life. His encounters of people from Africa – a continent then still almost entirely enchained as European colonies — gave him an appreciation of the independence struggle he soon made his own with his leadership of the Council on African Affairs. And from all these his interest in the Russian revolution, in the Soviet Union grew – and in his travels there he found an acceptance as a human being that he never found in the US or in London, found a path of development that embraced equality that he felt was the path of the future and which cemented his socialist convictions. The *Tallest Tree in the Forest* recounts this past and with it Robeson's decision to put to use the celebrity he achieved by returning to the United States and fully engaging in the struggle for social justice in his own land.\n\nAnd there he achieved a position of acclaim, becoming one of the most widely known and honored people in the US, a leader in the civil rights movement, a speaker and singer at numerous union conventions, demonstrations and rallies, a voice for the war against fascism and for giving that war content by fighting all forms of discrimination and injustice at home. And, in a few years, he went from being a political leader and a popular performer into a pariah, denounced by many who once welcomed him, listened to him; until he was driven into such isolation that Robeson became virtually unknown. It is a story that serves as a reminder of the power of the system to repress those it opposes — the fears stoked by pseudo-patriots as the Cold War commenced, the anti-communist witchhunts of the McCarthy-era and the power of racism all combined in an unforgiving assault to drive Robeson from the public arena. The two signal events – a speech Robeson gave at the Paris World Peace Conference in 1949, in which he denounced US racism and the growing danger of war against the Soviet Union, was distorted into a statement that US blacks would not fight in such a war. The alleged statement became an excuse to cause his ostracism, including from civil rights organizations and unions for whom he had spoken many times in the past. And with that came threats of violence that turned into action at Peekskill, New York when a mob whipped up into a frenzy of action, motivated by the trio of racism, anti-Semitism and anti-Communism, attacked the crowd of thousands who came to hear him perform. The threat of such violence led to the cancellation of every other of the hundreds of concerts Robeson had scheduled, led to the withdrawal of all his records from radio play or record store sale, and so completed his isolation. Robeson's name, photo, awards, were removed from Rutgers' record books, his name was stricken by the NAACP from the list of its honorees – he became an \"unperson,\" in his own homeland.\n\nAttacks which took a toll on him as a human being; the complications of his support for the Soviet Union as it engaged in its own wave of repression – and anti-Semitism — that caught some of Robeson's own friends in its web is not neglected in the play nor is the personal side of Robeson's life – the whole is looked at from his point-of-view as an older man who wears on his countenance the blows reigned upon him in those years. Beaty tell the story not only in Robeson's voice, but in that of other characters as well and gives a sense of the walls closing in on him. So it is that he tries to give depth to his portrayal of Robeson, through playing the role of Essie too — using her unfairly at times as a foil, as the counter-argument to bring into relief Paul's growth and development. By the end of the play, however, Beaty gives full credit to her courage and depth of understanding. Both are evident in the following passage from her book, *African Journey*, written after a trip through the continent in 1945:\n\n> Walls have been built against us, but we are always fighting to tear > them down and in the fighting, we grow, we find new strength, and all > their weaknesses. > > We have not built any walls to limit our world. > > We look at slavery – personal, economic and social slavery – and we > know that it has done us grave injury. But we have always fought that > slavery, resisted it everywhere, continuously; and in the fighting, in > the resistance, we have survived and grown strong. > > In fighting a just cause, in resisting oppression, there is dignity. > > We look at those who have enslaved us, and find them decadent. > Injustice and greed and conscious inhumanity are terribly destructive. > > Yes, I am glad and proud I am Negro. (pp 151-152)\n\nThose convictions were hers – and his, and, again, give added meaning to the denial of his right to travel, the attempt to enclose in walls a life devoted to breaking the barriers that deny freedom.\n\nThere are, however, two weaknesses in the play. First, the context of Robeson's life and politics is not given sufficient weight. Robeson was in every respect an exceptional human being, yet he was also a person of his times – who worked in concert with numerous others. He was part of the left-wing of the New Deal, part of the hundreds of thousands, of the millions who tried to stay true to those values when repression set in and so served as a bridge to the arising movement of the 1960s (even when he was not personally remembered). Even in defeat, he was never alone – a fact which should not be forgotten and downplayed.\n\nThe other weakness is in a lack of a challenge to the audience – the end of the play rightly notes the progress made since Robeson's days, but does not note how much more progress there needs to be before there we are a land of equality and justice. We, as audience members, empathize with Robeson, feel critical of those who abandoned him, honor him for helping blaze a trail that did result in remarkable changes in recent decades – yet are never made to feel a connection between the history told on stage and our present.\n\nIt is not enough to sympathize or empathize, rather – it is also important to act, to take a stand, when it is hardest and most difficult to do so. It is wonderful to be reminded of a life as beautiful and committed as Robeson's but nobody in the audience should have walked away thinking that this was all in the past. Victories have been won: Robeson – who died in 1976 — applauded the progress of the civil rights movement; but racism remains, neo-colonialism remains, wars continue, the division and exploitation of workers remains – and powerful forces of repression remain to silence those who speak out. And audience members should have been made to feel challenged to do more than they have to end the injustice all around us in the here and now.\n\nThough criticisms don't take away from the *Tallest Tree in the Forest's* strengths – or politics. The second act opens with Beaty as a \"professor,\" explaining what causes the state to target an activist. Speaking out for racial justice can mark a person as a threat to the system, speaking out for workers rights can do so too. But those who are advocates for workers rights and racial equality are the people those in power most hate, fear, attack. And few people embraced those values as passionately as did Robeson.\n\nRobeson expressed his beliefs in \"Ballad for Americans.\" It is a song that speaks to the underlying commonality of all people while celebrating their distinctiveness. It roots the strength of our country in the varied forms the labor of working people takes – and defines that as the content of the democracy to which we should aspire as society, a democracy at the root of his conception of socialism. It is a vision expressed in lines Robeson quotes to end his autobiography, a verse from Pablo Neruda's *Let the Rail Splitter Awaken:*\n\nLet us think of the entire earth\n\nAnd pound the table with love.\n\nI don't want blood again\n\nTo saturate bread, beans music:\n\nI wish they would come with me:\n\nThe miner, the little girl,\n\nThe lawyer, the seaman,\n\nThe doll-maker,\n\nTo go into a movie and come out\n\nTo drink the reddest wine ...\n\nI come here to sing\n\nAnd for you to sing with me.\n\nSources:\n\n*The Tallest Tree in the Forest*, Written and Performed by Daniel Beaty, Directed by Moises Kaufman; Arena Stage, January 10 – February 16.\n\nPaul Robeson, *Here I Stand*, Othello Associates, 1958\n\nEslanda Goode Robeson, *African Journey*, The John Day Company, 1945\n\nMartin Duberman, *Paul Robeson*, Alfred Knopf, 1988","order":1},{"title":"Eco-Collapse Is a Greater Risk for Class-Divided Societies, Suggests New Study by U-MD Modeler","date":"2014-04-02","issue":"April 2014","author":"Andy Feeney","body":"The *Guardian* newspaper would undoubtedly have displeased conservatives anyway when it publicized results of a recent computer study concluding that a fairly large number of \"advanced\" civilizations throughout history have fallen victim to large-scale collapse. Anthropologist Jared Diamond argued as much in his best-selling 2007 book *Collapse*, which linked the collapse of the statue-builders of Easter Island and the eventual disappearance of the Viking settlements in Greenland to the failure of these societies to recognize environmental limits. Collapse's clear implication was that the advanced society of the United States, too, is probably whistling past the graveyard. However, some other anthropologists challenged some of Diamond's methods, and anyway, the basically neo-Malthusian implications of his book are ones that conservatives have become comfortable ignoring.\n\nThe main highlights of the new computer modeling study that recently attracted the *Guardian*'s attention, however, were shorter and perhaps easier to read than Diamond's longish book. Also, the study, with mathematician Safa Motesharrie of the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy serving as lead researcher, and U-MD atmospheric researcher Eugenia Kalnay serving as co-author, focused on two factors that Diamond had mentioned much more obliquely in his work – inequality and social class.\n\nThe study, \"Human and Nature Dynamics (HANDY): Modeling Inequality and Use of Resources in the Collapse or Sustainability of Societies,\" has been accepted for publication in *Ecological Economics*, published by the scientific publishing group Elsevier. In it, the joint authors wrote that while a popular Western belief holds that complex, technically sophisticated societies virtually never collapse, but can draw on their strengths to adapt to new challenges, in fact: \"Collapses have occurred frequently in history, often followed by centuries of economic, intellectual, and population decline. Many different natural and social phenomena have been invoked to explain specific collapses, but a general explanation remains elusive. In this paper, we build a human population dynamics model by adding accumulated wealth and economic inequality to a predator-prey model of humans and nature.\"\n\nThe details of just what the authors did are a little complex and the validity of the mathematical equations they used to build their HANDY model may be beyond the ability of most lay people to follow. But in essence, what Motesharrie et al., did was to construct models of how three different kinds of society might respond to the risks of civilizational collapse resulting from population growth and resource depletion, or at least since the rise of city states in ancient Sumeria several millennia ago.\n\nExamples they cite briefly in the preamble to their study include the rise and fall of Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyrian, Babylonian and many later empires in the Middle East, up through the collapses of the Ummayyad and Abbasid Empires; the development and decline of repeated Egyptian dynasties over many thousands of years; the rise followed by the obliteration of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations in the eastern Mediterranean before the rise of classical Greco-Roman culture; the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, the disappearance of the Hittite empire in Anatolia and the Harrappan civilization of the ancient Indus Valley; the later flourishing and disappearance of the Mauryan and Gupta empires in India; the coming and going of historic dynasties in China; and the \"repeated and overlapping\" collapses of major civilizations in Southeast Asia over a period of 15 centuries, culminating with the end of the Khmer empire of Cambodia in the 15th century AD. The historic decline of Mayan civilization in Central America and a series of complex civilizations in Mexico, along with the evident collapse of ancient Zimbabwe in Africa, also indicate that the phenomena of civilizational collapse is not unique to Eurasia, the authors note. In fact, at least one scholarly study suggests that when settled agriculture was first introduced to Europe in Neolithic times, this was followed \"by a boom-and-bust pattern in the density of regional populations.\" Arguably, the wealth of research on the subject indicates that rather than civilizational collapse being an unusual event in history, it may be the rule — rather than the exception. . The three ideal societies being modeled included (1) an \"equal\" society in which everyone is essentially a worker, and resources, income and wealth are equally shared; (2) an \"egalitarian\" society in which some people (for example, students) are not workers, but incomes are basically equal; and (3) an \"unequal\" society divided between \"Elites\" and \"Commoners,\" in which the Elites capture most of society's wealth for themselves, leaving the Commoners earning bare minimum incomes just adequate for survival.\n\nWhen the three model scenarios were run on the computer, the results indicated that all three kinds of society can suffer from civilizational collapse due to over-population and excessive resource depletion. All three societies, when growth rates are optimal, can achieve a \"soft landing\" solution where population and resource use both adjust to the limits imposed by the environment, without major collapse or major population losses. All three societies also can \"overshoot\" environmental limits and suffer smaller to larger losses in population, yet then return to sustainable levels of resource use – although at lower population levels and lower levels of wealth than the \"soft landing\" societies achieve.\n\nYet class-divided, unequal societies in which the Elites command most of resources and wealth while forcing the Commoners to do all the work, the study suggests, are far more likely to suffer from long-term collapse than the other two model societies.\n\nAs the authors put it, their modeling indicated two different ways in which unequal, class-divided societies can collapse: (a) the Elites can appropriate so many resources at the cost of the Commoners that the Commoners starve or stop reproducing themselves, causing an eventually fatal labor shortage, or (b) the Elites can ensure that the society exploits too many resources and faces environmental collapse, decimating Commoners and Elites alike.\n\nThe authors note: \"It is important to note that in both of these scenarios, the Elites —due to their wealth — do not suffer the detrimental effects of the environmental collapse until much later than the Commoners. This buffer of wealth allows Elites to continue 'business as usual' despite the impending catastrophe. It is likely that this is an important mechanism that would help explain how historical collapses were allowed to occur by elites who appear to be oblivious to the catastrophic trajectory (most clearly apparent in the Roman and Mayan cases). This buffer effect is further reinforced by the long, apparently sustainable trajectory prior to the beginning of the collapse. While some members of society might raise the alarm that the system is moving towards an impending collapse and therefore advocate structural changes to society in order to avoid it, Elites and their supporters, who opposed making these changes, could point to the long sustainable trajectory 'so far' in support of doing nothing.\"\n\nSumming up, the authors further state: \"either one of the two features apparent in historical societal collapses —over-exploitation of natural resources and strong economic stratification— can independently result in a complete collapse. Given economic stratification, collapse is very difficult to avoid and requires major policy changes, including major reductions in inequality and population growth rates ... However, collapse can be avoided and population can reach equilibrium if the per capita rate of depletion of nature is reduced to a sustainable level, and if resources are distributed in a reasonably equitable fashion.\"\n\nThese conclusions, of course, are only based on computer modeling, and computer models are notorious for being sensitive to the assumptions built into them. It's not clear how much faith scientists should put in the study's scenarios, nor how adequate the mathematical modeling for the scenarios really was. But the *Guardian*'s March 14 story about the report, which among other things noted that it was written with financial help from NASA, drew a furious reaction from some critics, and in the last few days NASA officials have distanced the agency themselves from direct responsibility for the conclusions.\n\nMeanwhile the study has sparked a firestorm of debate in the blogosphere and the media, evoking sharp comments from such varying sources as *The Washington Times*, *Discover* magazine, progressive commentator Bill Moyers, the *International Business Times*, the left-leaning *Independent* in Britain, and a host of others.\n\n*Washington Socialist* readers who are curious about the study and the controversy it has provoked may want to look at the original paper, here: [*http://www.atmos.umd.edu/\\~ekalnay/pubs/2014-03-18-handy1-paper-draft-safa-motesharrei-rivas-kalnay.pdf *](http://www.atmos.umd.edu/%7Eekalnay/pubs/2014-03-18-handy1-paper-draft-safa-motesharrei-rivas-kalnay.pdf)\n\nThe March 14 Guardian blog by Dr. Nafeez Ahmed that brought the study to the attention of the media is here: [*http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists*](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists).\n\nDr. Ahmed's March 212 defense of the study and of his original blog about it can be read here: [*http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists*](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists). Among other things, this latter blog quotes several prominent critics of the Motesharrie study and the HANDY model used to derive it; it also cites a defense of the model and its usefulness by a team led by Dr. Rodrigo Castro of the Department of Environmental Systems Science at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.\n\nFrom a socialist perspective, what is fun to speculate about is to what degree the study and the controversy about it may influence the politics of the mainstream American environmental movement, and how. For much of the later 20th century, many militant environmentalists were inspired by the gloomy population theories of Rev. Thomas Malthus, whose famous 1798 *Essay on Population* was explicitly reactionary in its politics. Specifically attacking the utopian anarchist theories of William Godwin and the moderate French revolutionary the Marquis de Condorcet, who had speculated about the eventual establishment of a peaceful, egalitarian society through evolutionary means, Rev. Malthus in 1798 argued that \"misery\" or extreme poverty was needed to keep poor people from causing a demographic disaster through having too many children.\n\nMalthus also argued that the twin institutions of \"private property\" and economic hierarchy are essential in staving off an over-population disaster.\n\nBut in their study, Motesharrie et al., have put forward a seemingly logical model of how excessive economic hierarchy and unequally distributed property should cause exactly the sort of environmental disaster that neo-Malthusian environmentalists have always wanted to avoid. Could this possibly push some traditional environmentalists toward eco-socialism?","order":2},{"title":"Ethics, race overshadow other issues in DC primary election","date":"2014-04-02","issue":"April 2014","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"Muriel Bowser's victory in the DC Democratic primary for mayor on April 1 can be largely attributed to District voters' continued anger at the string of ethics lapses among elected officials. Unfortunately, the chatter over whether defeated Mayor Vincent Gray is or is not a crook forced issues of critical importance to the District – education, affordable housing, the rise in homelessness, how to achieve statehood – to take a back seat.\n\nReflecting Bowser's victory was former Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner Brianne Nadeau's win over four-term incumbent Ward 1 Councilmember Jim Graham. Nadeau ran a largely one-issue campaign, focusing on Graham's involvement in a Metro development deal that was tied to a contract to run the DC lottery. Graham offered his support to a businessman for a contract to run the DC lottery if he would drop a bid to work on Metro projects, allegedly as a favor for a campaign contributor. In past years, Graham's behavior could be written off as the kind of routine wheeling and dealing one expects from elected officials. But with three DC councilmembers having been convicted of crimes over the past two years and a mayor who may join them, voters had zero tolerance for anything bearing even a whiff of scandal.\n\nThe allegations against Gray, on the other hand, cause Graham's actions to pale in significance. The secret \"shadow\" campaign conducted by recently convicted businessman Jeffrey Thompson tainted Gray's 2010 victory and cast a long shadow over the mayor's entire first term. Thompson, whose wealth depended on his company's securing contracts with the city, spent $668,000 off-the-books dollars to help Gray defeat Mayor Adrian Fenty, and after the election the Gray administration paid Thompson's health-care company over $7 million – not a bad return on investment. However, earlier this year Thompson's luck ran out when he pleaded guilty to criminal charges and said that Gray knew all about the secret campaign, notwithstanding Gray's claims of ignorance of the affair. U.S. Attorney Ron Machen has all but promised that an indictment of Gray is forthcoming.\n\nBowser has been justifiably criticized for lack of accomplishment during her seven years on the DC Council, not only by her opponents but by Council colleagues and the media as well. Her signature issue has been an ethics bill that she shepherded through the Council in 2012 as she eyed a run for mayor against a scandal-plagued incumbent. The jury is out on whether the bill is tough enough to restore the confidence of DC voters in their elected officials. But Bowser was a questionable choice for ethics champion, having chosen DC uber-lobbyist David Wilmot as the chairman of her 2012 re-election campaign. Wilmot also represented Wal-mart before the DC government, and it was surely more than coincidence that Bower subsequently voted against the Large Retailer Accountability Act, which would have required Wal-mart and other big-box stores to pay a higher wage than the DC minimum. In addition, Bowser joined the Council as the protégé of former Mayor Adrian Fenty, and supported his controversial takeover of the DC public school system and the teacher-bashing policies of Michelle Rhee, Fenty's appointed chancellor of DC schools.\n\nThat it was Bowser who emerged as the alternative to Gray, rather than three other councilmembers in the race or progressive businessman Andy Shallal, who got less than 4 percent of the vote, can be heavily attributed to race and class divisions in the District. If experience were the only consideration, Ward 2 Councilmember Jack Evans, with more than two decades on the Council, would have been the obvious choice. However, Evans was compromised by his coziness with DC developers and other business interests and drew only 5 percent of the vote. Ward 6 Councilmember Tommy Wells, who finished third with just under 13 percent, failed to make his vision of a \"livable, walkable city\" compelling to more than a core of mostly white newcomers and progressives. Shallal, who was endorsed by Metro-DC DSA, gained the support of some progressives, but failed to gain traction as Bowser emerged as the candidate who could defeat Gray. Councilmember and perennial candidate Vincent Orange was a non-factor.\n\nIndeed, the results show how race still plays a dominant role in the District, even with the African American population having slipped under 50 percent and Latinos increasing in number, if not yet in political influence. Bowser's base of support was the mostly white western half of the city, notwithstanding that she herself is African American, while Gray drew from the heavily African-American eastern wards, although in smaller numbers than in 2010. This indicates that even white voters are leery of jumping on the bandwagon of a white candidate, either out of liberal guilt, concern that race relations could deteriorate under a white mayor in a city that has never previously elected one, or out of a strategic decision that a white could not win. Gray, on the other hand – a resident of heavily African American Ward 7 – tried to paint himself as yet another black DC officeholder being targeted by the federal government. His endorsement by Councilmember and former Mayor Marion Barry, himself targeted 24 years ago by the feds for cocaine use, was intended to make this connection clear to his base. Unfortunately for Gray, it was not enough.\n\nBowser moves to the general election campaign to face David Catania, a Republic-turned-independent councilmember. Catania jumped into the race in the hopes that a crippled Gray would win the nomination and be a relatively easy target in the fall. Bowser's victory throws a wrench into that strategy, and he will undoubtedly cast his record on the council against hers. Yet Catania is asking DC voters to support a white, openly gay, non-Democratic candidate for mayor – all of which would be firsts. Catania is a formidable campaigner, but he has a steep hill to climb.\n\nA mayoral campaign between Bowser and Catania is not one for progressives to look forward to. One can expect them to promise to address the critical issues facing the District but fail to present substantive solutions. DSA members and other progressives can take consolation that progressive Council Chair Phil Mendelson, who was endorsed by Metro-DC DSA, will face only token opposition in the fall. In addition, Catania's leaving the Council to run for mayor makes his seat available for a possible campaign by a progressive third-party candidate or independent. With the general election still seven months away, there may be an opening, however slim, for progressives to have an impact.","order":3},{"title":"GOOD READS for socialists, April 2014","date":"2014-04-02","issue":"April 2014","author":"","body":"&gt;&gt;Well, here's the bad news we have all been expecting. As socialists, we view the long-coherence of any society as being undermined by inequality. A new report spurred by NASA indicates that the relation of galloping resource consumption and climate change to inequality worsens both and makes social collapse more likely.\n\nHere's a summary of the piece in the Guardian:\n\n<http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists>\n\nand here's a link to a PDF of the quite wonkish original...\n\n[http://www.atmos.umd.edu/\\~ekalnay/pubs/handy-paper-for-submission-2.pdf](http://www.atmos.umd.edu/%7Eekalnay/pubs/handy-paper-for-submission-2.pdf)\n\n&gt;&gt;Andy Feeney has vetted the just-released latest assessment of our climate future by the UN's panel on climate change; here's his summary and links to the full document:\n\nImpacts from global climate change are already evident on every continent of the world, according to a new report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and should intensify through the year 2100 in the absence of strong efforts to reduce human civilization's emissions of \"greenhouse\" gases.  There is still some scientific uncertainty over just how severely projected climate change will affect different societies, yet the scientific consensus points to a \"high level of certainty\" that it will have a particularly negative effect on poor people, especially in Africa and southeast Asia. It should also cause disproportionate damage to different population groups as sorted by gender, with women likely to be hurt worse than men; and by age, with children, the sick and the elderly suffering more than healthy working-age adults.\n\nThe IPCC's Part 2 section of its Fifth Assessment report, the part addressing human impacts of climate change, does point to many societies that are undertaking efforts to adapt to climate change — a hopeful sign, according to the IPCC's team of authors. But there is \"high confidence\" that projected levels of change will subject different societies to several key risks, as well as \"medium\" confidence that it will have a host of other negative effects. The key risks for which there is \"high confidence\" of their happening include: Flooding of low-lying coastal zones and small islands by storm surges and sea level rise; inland flooding in urban areas; breakdown of infrastructure and government services during flooding, storms and heat waves; severe water shortages and consequent food insecurity in rural and, later, urban areas from changing climate patterns (all these leading to increased endemic disease as well as incident mortality); and loss of biodiversity, habitat and food sources such as fisheries, including by ocean acidification. *New York Times* reporter Justin Gillis on March 31 provided a hard-hitting, arguably somewhat one-sided account of how bad the IPCC expects the human effects of climate change to be. \"Nobody on this planet is going to be untouched,\" the Gillis story quotes IPCC chair Rajendra K. Pachauri as stating. The IPCC Part 2 report itself is somewhat less forcefully worded and more filled with qualifications than the *Times* story, but hardly a cause for great optimism.\n\nFor the IPCC's \"Summary for Policy Makers\" for the Part 2 report, click here:\n\n[*http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/IPCC\\_WG2AR5\\_SPM\\_Approved.pdf*](http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/IPCC_WG2AR5_SPM_Approved.pdf)\n\nFor access to the full report, organized on a chapter-by-chapter basis, click here:\n\n[*https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/*](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/)\n\n**&gt;&gt;Now this is a badread**... not awful in tone and intent, but exemplary of limited thinking.

New York: Harper/Collins Perennial, 2014. Paperback $15.99\n\nThis is a book that one roots for. The title's invitation \"Imagine living in a socialist USA\" hits the note for those among us who spend, we may feel, way too much of our time strategizing about how to get to that blissful condition and not enough time enjoying the thought of being there.\n\nThe writers in this anthology, who offer many good future memories of a socialist existence, nevertheless can't seem to wrench themselves from the same sticking points that bother all of us: What's wrong with capitalist society and what can we do to change it? That's certainly on our collective minds, and driving us out of them. But I hoped for more from this book.\n\nMany episodes in this rich compendium do indeed find that sweet spot for us, and moreover are able to use the anatomy of our hoped-for utopia as an analytical tool. But there are many cases where the impulse to explain what's wrong puts a damper on the imagination of what could be. The writers, many well-known, appear to be (like many of us) wrapped too tightly in the struggle to dream as much as promised.\n\nThat, in turn, brings the reader to wonder about the book's audience. Is the already-convinced socialist activist going to learn new things and ideas about how to create that socialist future? Without a doubt, though maybe not a whole book's worth of new things and ideas. Is the person who is underinformed about socialism going to be educated and persuaded? Not so much, though there are several pieces that are unusually accessible, largely because their format escapes the stereotypical left-analytic. Most of the arguments here, though tightly written for the most part, already assume a reader's tilt toward socialism and some familiarity with the way the left's internal arguments are framed. So the audience is not the curious reader who has not dismissed socialism – yet – in part because that curious reader has heard little about it.\n\nThe editors advise us that the book has three sections: an indictment of capitalism; imaginative portraits of what a socialist USA might be like; finally, \"how to get from where we are to where we want to be.\"\n\nThe first section contains only one article, Paul Street's \"Capitalism: the real enemy.\" It mixes feature-style strategies – showing the destructive effect of capitalism on an individual victim with a face and name – with critical structural analysis. Like most of the articles in *Imagine Living in a Socialist USA,* it is solid work. The second section – imagining the experience of a socialist society – is not that different, alas. Specific attempts to create the future experience of socialism with respect to the economy, are hindered by the felt need to explain what is wrong with the present system. That refrain makes some of the essays duplicative even though they are individually solid work, also, and the chance to establish a different vision is dimmed by this pattern.\n\nWomen writers in this section, not surprisingly, break the left-analytic mold more often, and to good effect. Harriet Fraad and Tess Fraad-Wolff, as well as Renate Bridenthal, eschew structural analysis and provide coherent and lyrical paragraphs about a life without capitalist features: \"Imagine feeling safe..... the luxury of time..... life without capitalist efficiency.\" And Bridenthal: \"Imagine waking up looking forward to going to work..... that having children while holding a job is no problem.\" Blanche Wiesen Cook instead offers a tasty history of women who concretely lived \"Dignity, Respect, Equality, Love\" including less-known feminists like Crystal Eastman and Alexandra Kollontai. They prefigured socialist practice as well as promoting it. More of this approach would have given this section the flavor that was apparently intended.\n\nThe articles in the second, \"Imagining Socialism,\" include powerful strategic arguments despite the section head; many could as easily fall into section three, \"Getting There.\" Richard Wolff's economic critique notes pointedly that radicals apply their energies to factors outside the workplace when changing the conditions and relations inside that most unfree and undemocratic of US situations is a better bet. Wolff says \"...socialists' critiques of capitalism over the last century have rarely focused on transforming that internal organization \\[the workplace\\] – which shapes how capitalism works or fails to work – to eliminate the exploitation it engenders.\" As he notes, in that workplace context the relations of production are always in formation – and more subject, perhaps, to radical action – whereas in the political and legal realm the dominance of capital is already institutionalized. Democracy within the workplace could have more bang for the buck than democracy outside it. Wolff, of course, has elaborated on the theory and the \"actually existing\" democratic workplace in *Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism*.\n\nA powerful indictment of US mass incarceration and alternatives to it including communal courts is provided by Mumia Abu-Jamal and Angela Davis in \"Alternatives to the Present System of Capitalist Injustice\" and co-editor Michael Steven Smith complements it with an account of how capitalism and its rulers came to be privileged in the US legal system. Frances Fox Piven imagines a society that not only abolishes poverty with public support but abolishes the degradation and loss of social status that has come to be associated with poverty – a public perception that maintains capitalism's grip and enforces class at the same time that it divides natural class allies.\n\nArun Gupta shows how food security, better supported by government regulation, is an avenue to a fully democratized \"food sovereignty\" and – because food security is so central to everyone's lives – a path to many other democratic determinations within the economy.\n\nThe final section, as noted, is often hard to distinguish from the middle section — articles in both tend to do the same work, setting a problematic capitalist condition, proposing alternatives. But some are distinctive. Kazembe Balagun provides the undertold story of socialist thought and expression within the black freedom struggle, which he calls the \"unfinished chapter\" of that struggle. The civil rights movement and the Occupy movement both, he said, provide \"prefigurative spaces\" that show what can be, and electrifyingly quotes C.L.R. James to the effect that they are \"the future in the present.\" Clifford D. Connor suggests the left needs to be prepared for transformational events, and implicitly raises the question: If the left wasn't prepared to take advantage of the meltdown of 2008-09, will it be ready for the next such opportunity? Diane Feeley elegizes the Detroit that was and argues that the Detroit that is can revive the plant occupations of the '30s and intervene in cavalier plant closings and the financialist strip-out of urban resources through from-below popular audits.\n\nSeveral offerings in the third section stand out as exemplars of socialism. Most engaging is the science fiction writer Terry Bisson's \"Thanksgiving 2077: a Short Story.\" A family gathers in that future year to reflect on their roles in a socialist USA and their memories of how it happened. The table is presided over by grandpa, \"an old union man (IWW 2.0)\" who notes \"if we had dismantled capitalism sooner, we could have stopped global warming. Or at least slowed it.\" Now, he mourns to the grandchildren fresh from their jobs (many working off student loans with public projects) \"half your work is damage control.\" Fighting wildfires and evacuating areas being inundated by rising seas – including, apparently, much of Florida – are typical of the work of socialism in the latter part of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. But too, there's \"commons restoration\" – returning land and infrastructure from private to public ownership – and landfill mining for recyclable plastic \"now that petroleum is under UN interdiction.\"\n\nIn Bisson's story, the transition to socialism was not easy – the narrator's parents were killed \"in the fighting in Philly\" and one at the meal lost an eye in the \"Baltimore Courtroom Assault.\" One of the Thanksgiving celebrants, a young scholar, is working on a project asserting, however, that \"the transition to socialism was easier since the government was more involved with disaster relief than war.\"\n\nOne thing Bisson's story obliquely indicates is the price of delay. The USA of 2077 is not the USA the editors present as the most likely of all the world's nations to be a successful socialist society because of its abundance of resources and skill. The USA of 2077 has lost much of that luster, and life is spare and limited by consensus – an outcome that can be seen in its seed in today's hollowing out of the middle class, the degradation of education at all levels, and the concrete results of worsening inequality. Bisson's future is not a fantasy but the best one can hope for given present trends. The worst is unimaginable. Michael Harrington used to tell audiences that socialism was the likely outcome of most futures, and the question was what kind of socialism – democratic or autocratic. Bisson's future narrowly manages the former.\n\nWhen the writers succeed – and they frequently do – in conveying the calm, unoppressed and fertile experience of a socialist society, it is fleeting. \"Actually existing\" examples are few. As Richard Wolff observes in his useful contribution, the \"lack of a powerful, attractive and credible vision of socialism is a major block to social movements against capitalism, despite the inequality, waste and suffering that system has produced.\" (43)\n\nA theme that runs through many of the articles in this book, as it does through endless conversations in our own DSA organization, is the question of whether reforms are pathways to a viable socialism or side trips, dead ends. Joel Kovel dismisses reformist social democracy in both an article and a poem. \"...socialism can no longer be the reformist social democracy that has betrayed its promise by seeking to perfect capitalism instead of going beyond it.,\" he says in the second section. And in a poem that ends the book, read to the Occupiers of Zuccotti Park, he says that \"that \"your space of occupation is both a site of resistance and a site of production/. .... You are not here to want what they want you to want:/ to help out the Democratic Party;/ to get a seat at the big table;/ to rationalize the deadly regime of accumulation... .\"\n\nIn fact, the book's persistent metaphor is the Occupy movement, which most of the writers explicitly reference. The surreal fact of socialism existing evanescent in one square in the midst of its mortal foe is an almost musical refrain throughout, and can be seen as illustrating the possibility of a socialist life in the midst of the worst of its opposite, \"the future in the present\" as C.L.R. James was quoted above.\n\nDepressingly but accurately, though, most of the writers emphasize the need for a struggle perspective if a future is to be won. Michael Zweig, speaking prose, tells the Zuccotti Park occupiers in \"The Working-Class Majority\" that MLK's well-known \"arc of history.... does not bend by itself. That is our responsibility.\"\n\n*Imagine Living in a Socialist USA* is a collection of excellent, sound work by thoughtful writers on the left, and most socialists (certainly this one) will learn an immense amount from its pages. Though there are individual articles and stories that fulfill the promise of the title, nevertheless, many are too far into the weeds on the vicissitudes of life under capitalism and pathways out of it to get successfully to the full richness of the goal of imagining a socialist future.","order":5},{"title":"Maryland Legislative Roundup: Mike & Mike Kill a Bill","date":"2014-04-02","issue":"April 2014","author":"Woody Woodruff","body":"Less than two weeks remain in the Maryland General Assembly's 2014 session. Many of the high-salience items for the left – the minimum wage and earned sick leave bills, for instance – are hovering. The minimum wage bill was badly roughed up during its passage in the House of Delegates – indexing and a corresponding raise for tipped workers were stripped out, notably. The administration's original bill is still under consideration in the Senate.\n\nBut one bill, which would have opened up opportunities for serious reform in the state's ability to plan its own destiny independent of corporate capitalism, has met an unusually foul end.\n\n[*The bill promoting a Maryland's Future commission*](http://dsadc.org/an-update-on-marylands-legislature/) to develop plans for a post-military economy for the state was derailed in mid-March by the two top dogs in the Assembly – House speaker Mike Busch and Senate president Mike Miller. The Commission for Maryland's Future, [*a project of Fund Our Communities and Peace Action,*](http://dsadc.org/maryland-looks-at-formal-state-body-on-defense-transition/) envisioned a legislative mandate for a study group that would plan for new tech and and knowledge-based businesses, including alternative energy production, as a logical successor industry to building superfluous F-35s for Lockheed. In its inception it would have involved (gasp!) industrial policy, actual democratic planning, rather than allowing corporate capitalists to keep on calling the tune for Maryland. The members of the proposed commission would include academics, environmentalists and techies, labor and human needs activists and so forth – as befits a plan from Fund Our Communities, which seeks to wrest at least some of the Pentagon's hoard for state and local government and social needs.\n\nNot a happy place for Mike & Mike, who had the CMF bill summarily killed. The House Economic Matters Committee, previously insulted by this correspondent as a \"graveyard for good ideas,\" provided an unfavorable report (death sentence) March 3. In the other chamber, it was nixed March 13 by a unanimous Senate Finance Committee (including by five co-sponsors of the bill, one of whom was the chairman). Reliable sources indicate that one of Lockheed's many registered lobbyists stirred that pot in the Senate committee.\n\nIn its place, and solely by fiat, the two Mikes decreed that there would be a \"private sector commission\" that would advise them, that is the two Mikes, on how to pursue \"a joint legislative and business economic development agenda\" that was apparently announced in January to no fanfare.\n\nAnd who serves on that commission to advise the two Mikes? Twenty trusty establishment representatives, four of whom are women but all stalwarts of the private sector. Even the academics are steeped in the nonpublic sector; one's day job is to commercialize and monetize the research of one of the state's top research universities. There are six legislators, none likely to rattle any corporate cages, including one from the oft-lethal Senate Finance Committee as well as the chair of Economic Matters in the House. Someone's quid and someone's quo, as always. Environmentalists? Zero. Union reps? One, and no militant. Human and economic rights advocates?

The US has followed this policy except when US business interests were involved or when the Cold War decided foreign citizens were acting against \"perceived\" US interests. The results of ignoring other peoples' views has had the US supporting dictators, the Iranian coup, ignoring a Vietnam plebiscite, and other actions suggesting the US is bigger on talking then acting on our ideals.\n\nNow we see a takeover of Crimea by Russian forces despite a treaty providing security assurance to Ukraine in return for its agreement to discontinue the world's third largest nuclear arsenal in the 1990s. Russia continues to interfere in Ukraine's internal affairs by sending armies to its borders and sending Russian ultranationalists into Ukraine to create problems for the new government, which simply desires to freely choose Western democratic values and economics. Russia may be dissed by former Warsaw Pack nations joining NATO but they had their reasons.\n\nThe coup instigated in Crimea was made by Russian Special Forces without insignias. The coup reestablishes the over 200 years of Russian control of Crimea. Although Russian democracy is less a reality than a formality, in this case, the current majority of the Crimean population seems to want to join the Russia Federation.\n\nThis action startles both the US and the European Union (E.U.) since it's the first time since 1945 that land has been forcibly annexed in Europe. The fate of Ukraine is not clear. Russia has proclaimed that it will look out for Russians being discriminated against. That \"tactic\" was used before World War II by the Germans in Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe world got to this place because of several factors. Putin is playing the strong man, aligning himself with Russian history. The E.U. has dictated terms that Ukraine had to meet to become an E.U. member, thus forcing Ukraine to choose economically between Europe or Russia. Russia has a different opinion since many Russians consider Ukraine the birthplace of much Russian culture and Ukraine's population has many self-identified Russians. The treatment of Russia by the US as a junior partner and a loser of the Cold War did not help.\n\n**What Now**?\n\nWhat would a democratic socialist foreign policy on the Russian-Ukraine dispute look like? It would include an understanding of history, not rushing to war, but probably preparing for actions from a position of common strength. It might support a plebiscite on Crimea's return to Russia supervised by the United Nations. One would attempt to use economic tools and play military options down, but not encourage adventurism from either side.\n\nRussian history is a tale of a national security state and military that goes back eight hundred years and includes an almost two-century occupation by the Mongols or their cousins. The US has had a serious standing military force only since 1941. Russia, unlike the US, has been invaded by most of its neighbors. That history suggests that the ending of the Soviet Union and having the Warsaw Pact countries flip to NATO was a major change and shock for Russia and may have contributed to Russia's current views. Russia has historically needed and implemented a strong defense capability that was also used offensively to expand all the way to Alaska and Afghanistan. In World War II the US was the junior partner to the Soviets in fighting the Nazis. For every American war orphan there may have been 40 to 60 soviet war orphans. That had to have a psychological impact on the Russian mind. Russia has a corrupt elite of oligarchs that weakens its economic creativity and strength of its people and economy. In the US, our elites often use their riches to heavily influence elections and legislation. In Russia the oligarchs use corrupted officials and extra legal means to eliminate rivals in addition to using the US elites' tools.\n\nThe absorption of Crimea by Russia is a fait accompli and a round of sanctions by Europe and the US will result. So far only individual oligarchs are targeted. These sanctions will be at best inconveniences since there is still money to be made trading with Russia.\n\nHowever the territorial integrity of the rest of Ukraine is not clear and the Russian moves are a shock to the security of Europe. Possible further moves on the Ukraine require options to be prepared. Serious sanctions would require blocking trade but much of Europe depends upon Russian natural gas.\n\n**Marshall Plan II**\n\nReviving a Marshall Plan by the US and E. U. could be aimed at long-term loans to allow some NATO nations plus Ukraine to increase weatherization and other technologies to be less dependent on Russian gas. The U. S. loans would allow nations to buy US energy technologies and thus also be a stimulus to the US economy. The aim would be to speed the transition to renewables and permanently decrease the need for Russian natural gas. Creating American LNG exports would only continue demand and would be undercut by Russian gas when the crisis was over. Other aids may be needed in the form of education aimed at creating a less corrupt economy and political sphere in Ukraine.\n\nThe potential for armed conflict over Ukraine seems to be real and steps should be taken to make this option undesirable. NATO's militaries have been decreasing which may have enticed Russian moves. The world order before Russia's latest move assumed the there would be no conventional wars or moves at least in Europe. NATO militaries are configured to have an expeditionary role in places like Afghanistan and Africa while having a symbolic conventional role. NATO militaries have to change to meet this new challenge. However there is a way to balance NATO/Russia military strength without too much cost.\n\n**Lend-Lease II**\n\nThe U. S. could loan NATO surplus armored vehicles (US has 8,000 tanks) to balance Russian arms that have been increasing lately. The aim is not to start a war but to make sure that Russia does not see NATO as disarmed.\n\nThe US and NATO have no treaty obligations to defend Ukraine, so it would be important to signal Russia that NATO is not moving into Ukraine or being a threat. The US and NATO need a discussion on what next steps should be taken if Russia does attack the rest of Ukraine. Serious sanctions could create a blow to the Russian economy. Balancing this blow would require Russia to reroute its pipelines to China which could take years.\n\nStaying with the current world borders has allowed many governments to focus on economic development or internal corruption when the world needs to focus on climate change and development to raise people from poverty. A democratic socialist solution should minimize the possibilities of war and maximize sustainable development and democracy.\n\nA creative diplomatic policy would forgo a winner takes all solution and treat Ukraine for what it has always been, a gateway between the Russia and Europe. However, having Russian armies on Ukraine's border does not lend to honest dialogue let alone creative thinking. Putin's call to Obama can be seen as an attempt to undercut Ukraine's sovereignty by creating a Russian-U. S. solution. Hopefully Obama will not fall for that. Currently we are left with a diplomatic war of maneuver and the hope it will not become hot.\n\n*This post was updated April 2, 2014; the final paragraph was revised to reflect more recent events.*","order":7},{"title":"Shallal, DSA members discuss vision for DC","date":"2014-04-02","issue":"April 2014","author":"Bill Mosley","body":"About 25 DSA members and friends gathered in Northwest DC on March 30 during a wintry storm to hear DC mayoral candidate Andy Shallal discuss his vision for the District of Columbia, whether or not he won the Democratic primary.\n\nThe meet-and-greet and fundraising event for the DSA-endorsed Shallal took place two days before the election that resulted in DC Councilmember Muriel Bowser winning the Democratic nomination.\n\nShallal and his campaign manager, Bob Muehlenkamp, spoke of how the Shallal campaign had \"changed the debate\" by forcing other candidates in the race to discuss issues they preferred to ignore, such as economic inequality, the need for more affordable housing, and how to raise the academic achievement of low-income and minority students.

The World Trade Organization, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund are sufficient for them; these are the principal instruments of their strategy. \\[National\\] governments are still needed, as in the past, to maintain rights, but in the framework of globalization, sovereign authority melts like snow in the sun.\" – *Jean Zeigler, Special Advisor to the United Nations for Human Rights.*\n\n\"The creation of the Euro has functioned, from the outset, as a neo-liberal vehicle. From the Mastricht Treaty \\[which created the European Union (EU)\\] to the current fiscal packages, all agreements behind the common currency have obligated governments to enforce the ever more brutal policies that today we call austerity. ... With the economic crisis each new pact has forced cabinets to take measures the exact opposite of what has been needed. Therefore the crisis has led to a severe recession. The Europe of the Euro is politically, socially and culturally a failure.\"—*Giorgio Cremaschi, former president of the Italian metal workers union, FIOM-CGIL.*\n\nIntroduced in 1999, the Euro is now the currency of 17 countries. Despite the promises of many advocates, it has not led to a more just or peaceful continent. Yet many critics of neoliberalism in the US look toward Europe as providing a more humane model of capitalism than our own – a reversal of a past in which many in Europe looked to the US. It is worth recalling that in the quarter century after World War II, the United States economy seemed to show a path through which the capitalist system could meet the needs of the majority of the working population. Fueled by the enormous wealth accumulated and productive capacity generated while other nations were being devastated by combat, the social contract developed in the late 1940's was built around economic growth. Strong unions negotiated pension and health benefits with large corporations, providing a model non-union firms felt compelled to emulate. A heterogeneous federal/state/municipal system emerged in which public infrastructure spending — financed by high taxation on the wealthy – constituted a de facto jobs program.\n\nThe continued existence of various New Deal programs to help the needy, the increase of agricultural subsidies to keep food prices low, and the expansion of public universities enabled many workers to build a middle-class lifestyle for themselves or their children, and provide a safety net for those without work during cyclical downturns. Racial, gender and other forms of discrimination remained legal and systemic, wide circles of the population were still condemned to lives of poverty, speed-up and harsh factory conditions were on-going sources of conflict; the whole system depended on war and environmental destruction. Nonetheless working-class standards of living were higher than ever before in history. The possibility of class mobility and continued prospects for social reform within the existing framework provided an argument that progress for working people was possible well short of socialism, well short of the universal social programs that characterized western European social democracy or the social market policies of their conservative Christian counterparts.\n\nAnother quarter century and a different picture appeared. In looking at the consequences of neoliberal economics and politics that have dominated social policy under both Republican and Democratic administrations the European model is attractive. Many EU countries provide a stronger safety net, greater social equality and social mobility than we do, along with greater access to food security and better – universal – health care. Mandated paid vacations, paid maternity or paternity leave stand in direct contrast to the countless exclusions from our unpaid family leave law and points to one of the many gaps between the two sides of the North Atlantic. Unions in Europe remain stronger than in the US, as do social democratic and other labor-based, alternative and left-wing parties. And the multi-class celebrations in most European nations of Obama's victory over Bush in 2008 reflected a clear preference for diplomacy over a \"war at any price\" foreign policy, just as the more inclusive European Union spoke to the acceptance of social policies completely absent in NAFTA.\n\nYet all that glitters is not gold. Just as the US system in the 1950s had lacks and vulnerabilities that led to its demise, so too current austerity measures reveal cracks and fissures in a Europe in which neoliberal corporate imperatives dictate public policy. Examples are easy to find. Portugal, for example, is facing bankruptcy, its economy having shrunk over 2% after a decade of stagnation. Unemployment now stands at 17.5%, while for youth the jobless rate is nearly 39%. Those figures are comparable to Italy's larger economy (which also shrank in 2012) and much worse in Greece and Spain, each with more than a quarter of their respective workforces without work – and each with a youth unemployment rate of over 55%. Overall in the European Union, 12% are without work – and with such numbers come budget cuts. Everywhere education spending, mass transit and infrastructure repair, social welfare and pensions are being reduced, while new health care fees and exclusions are being introduced. Moreover, shifting corporate investment has undermined numerous industries and intensified a decades-long process of union membership loss. Many social democratic, green and other left parties have – like the Democratic Party – trimmed their sails, prioritizing market satisfaction over social needs and losing strength in the process. Racial tensions – more accurately, racism— are also on the rise due to mounting insecurity and job competition. Capital can move everywhere in Europe with equal rights, whereas labor moves without equal rights or wages. Immigrants arriving from non-EU African or Middle-Eastern countries live life in a shadow world of shadow jobs with omnipresent police shadowing them.\n\nAnd everywhere parliaments are finding their powers cut; the so-called \"troika\" – the European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund – is able to override elected governments and force cutbacks in social spending and social services based on powers granted by a European Constitution ratified with little popular input or approval. Greece and Italy have both been forced to bow to the dictates of unelected bankers in order to receive any outside aid or investment.\n\nEven more powerful nations suffer. Unemployment in France has reached a record high of 3.2 million, 10.8% of the workforce. On May 5, more than 100,000 marched in a protest called by the Left Front. Led by former Socialist leader Jean-Luc Melanchon, demonstrators demanded that Socialist President Francoise Hollande stay true to his election promises, instead of pursuing austerity and \"labor-flexibility\" in order to comply with EU rules. Budgetary pressures at home that hurt workers, students and pensioners has not, however, meant military cutbacks. France's imperial dispatch of troops to Mali is one of many armed actions in its former colonial empire. Spain too, despite an economy in freefall, had the money to join NATO's imperial adventure in Mali.\n\nWith unemployment at \"only\" 5.8%, Germany is supposedly the exception to the rule. But Europe's woes don't stop at any particular border. April saw 300 BMW jobs go east from a factory in Leipzig to one in the Czech Republic. In consequence, a nearby factory – dependent on BMW – with 170 employees will shut down completely. The union and works council, seeing little hope, offered little resistance. More labor resistance was offered in Bavaria, but with the same result; an auto plant closed shop to set up production further east. These instances can be multiplied many times over as tens of thousands of jobs are shifted from western to eastern Europe.\n\nNonetheless, Germany, with a trade surplus, not a deficit, seems to have escaped the worst aspects of the crisis. Although German labor claims the government undercounts the jobless, no one will deny that its employment picture is far better than in most other European countries. In fact, the German economy's growth at a time when other countries are contracting has given it increased strength within the EU – strength enough to demand austerity abroad that is not fully practiced at home. But beneath the surface, all is not well – poverty is increasing within Germany, exacerbating a growing inequality. This has been made worse by cuts in the powerful social security network that underwrote the nation's economic growth in previous decades – witness an increase in the retirement age, in university fees, in \"exceptions\" to universal social welfare provisions. Employment levels have been maintained only by increasing the amount of part-time and sub-contracted work. The resulting drop in full-time employment has been matched by a decrease in union membership in absolute terms as well as a percentage of the workforce. A growing number of strikes reflect the harsher new climate.\n\nAs in the US, this doesn't make economic \"sense\" – but only if the economy is judged from what will benefit the majority of the population, rather than a small number at the top of society. As an editorial in *Neues Deutschland* (a newspaper close to the German Left Party) explained: \"The current miserable situation and bad outlook are only to a small degree due to financial policies. Much more responsible is the austerity imposed on failing economies by German leadership. It is not only anti-social as it sinks a broad part of the population into deep poverty. It will also throttle economic recovery of the countries that remain still in a recession.\" Force is required to put such a program in place – not only the force of economic power but also the force exercised through increased domestic police budgets, increased repression of immigrants and the force of war. Germany, the world's third largest arms exporter, also sent troops to Mali, sent soldiers to Afghanistan and takes part in other armed \"peace-keeping\" missions in subject parts of the globe.\n\nTo note all the above is not to pretend that the destruction of social insurance or the level of militarism in Germany or Europe as a whole has reached the levels found in the US. In organizing for health care benefits and pension rights, for humane welfare policies or meaningful leave policies, the more advanced measures in place in many European countries should be cited as a reminder that policies deemed impossible here are, in fact, very possible indeed. At the same time, we need to keep in mind that capitalism in Europe cannot, any more than in the US during the 1950s, hold the solution to our social decline. Austerity, neo-liberal corporatism, is not simply the result of particularly malevolent Republican politicians, or particularly opportunist Democratic ones; rather, it is the systemic direction of corporate capitalism today. In neither the US nor Europe can there be genuine freedom without a broad participatory democracy and that there is no democracy without genuine equality – and without peace.\n\nThat is the direction proposed by Sahra Wagenknecht, the German Left Party's deputy chair and parliamentary speaker on economic affairs. She has proposed alternatives to neo-liberal Europe's austerity that include a European-wide capital tax, direct financing of national budgets through a publicly controlled European central bank, the right of individual nations to regulate their own currencies (not now possible in Euro countries) and programs to foster real wage increases, higher pensions, and improved social services – proposals aimed at overcoming existing disparities between and within countries. Beyond that, she has put forth more fundamental goals:\n\n\"If the 500 largest European business concerns were broken up and their production and sales facilities, their buildings and infrastructure given over to each country where located, then Europe would have a new vision, within and without. Then finally changes would be possible that fail today because of the resistance of the core lobby of capital: A European unity that stands for unified living conditions and not for a unity utilized to optimize corporate profits. A European tax union that reforms national tax systems in order to strengthen social equality instead of intensifying inequality. A European foreign and security policy that is not developed to prepare for imperial war, but rather sees itself as responsible for disarmament, \\[global\\] parity and development. A European constitution that is more than ... a lever for disempowerment. A European social union that is fixed on high living standards and binding social rights for all ... Then finally, not only in proclamations and Sunday speeches, but rather in reality, we could change the old armed and war-ridden continent into a new, social and peaceful continent, valuing friendship, life and love.\"\n\n**Note**: *Neo-liberalism* as used here is the economic theory that upholds the primacy of property rights, free markets and free trade and is characterized by deregulation, privatization and withdrawal of the state from public provision. It stands in opposition to Keynesian full employment and social welfare programs. It was first implemented by the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile, then by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government in Britain and Ronald Reagan's Republican Administration in the US. Since the 1980s neoliberalism has dominated both Republican and Democratic public policy. President Obama's stimulus was an example of traditional Keynesian liberalism, his bank bailout an example of neoliberal conservatism.\n\n\n\nQuotes:\n\n(All translations are my own)\n\nJean Zeigler, *L'Empire de la honte*, (The Empire of Shame), 2005\n\nGiorgio Cremaschi, interview, \"Euro-Europa ist gescheitert,\" (\"The Euro and Europe is a Failure\") *Junge Welt*, May 7, 2013\n\n\"Simon Poelchau, \"Hamsterad\" (\"Hamster Wheel\") *Neues Deutschland,* May 4-5, 2013\n\nSahra Wagenknecht, *Kapitalismus im Koma, Eine sozialistische Diagnose* (*Capitalism in a Coma, a Socialist Diagnosis*), 2009\n\n\n\nOther Sources:\n\nDaniel Behruzi, \"Der Osten ruft,\" (\"The East Calls\") *Junge Welt*, April 2, 2013).\n\nJw-Bericht, \"'Tragodie' in Euro-Land\" (\"Tragedy in Euro-Land)\" *Junge Welt*, April 3, 2013)\n\nPeter Steiniger, \"Therapie schlagt nicht an\" (\"Therapy not Working\") *Junge Welt*, May 3, 2013\n\nKeine 'normale' Krise by Rainer Rupp – *Junge Welt* May 4-5, 2013\n\n(Euro-Kritik von links) (Euro-Critic from the Left) by Sahra Wagenknecht, *Junge Welt*, May 7, 2013.\n\nRalf Klingieck, \"Grosses Auskehren unsozialer Politik,\" (\"Sweep Away Unsocial Policies\") *Neues Deutschland*, May 4-5, 2013\n\n\n\n[SOCIALIST TAKEAWAYS: Bastille Day, the anniversary march, DSA convention, local support](http://dsadc.org/socialist-takeaways-bastille-day-the-anniversary-march-dsa-convention-local-support/)\n\n**Bastille Day's Lessons for Socialists**\n\n*By Bill Mosley*\n\nAs national holidays go, Bastille Day – the July 14 celebration of all things France – may seem to us Americans as lacking in substance. Unlike our own Independence Day, the date the United States came into being, Bastille Day marks nothing nearly as momentous as a new country being born. Rather, the French holiday marks the 1789 storming of a notorious Paris prison and the freeing of seven – yes, seven – prisoners. It would be four years before the guillotine claimed Louis XVI and the First French Republic would rise on the ashes of monarchy.\n\nEven the ouster of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette didn't exactly usher in a happily-ever-after era of *liberté, egalité, fraternité*. Within a decade of Louis' demise, republicanism had given way to Bonapartist empire. Then came more kings, another brief era of republicanism, and one more fling with Bonapartism before representative government settled in for good – eight decades after the fall of the Bastille. France's road from monarchy to democracy was very much a two-steps-forward, one-step-back, one-step-sideways journey.\n\nWe think of America's struggle against monarchy as a much cleaner affair. England's American colonists awakened on July 4, 1776 as subjects of King George III and went to sleep as citizens of a new democracy, endowed with the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Right?\n\nWell, not really. The promises of the Declaration of Independence were not fulfilled overnight – and some remain unfulfilled today. Thomas Jefferson's famous dictum that \"all men are created equal\" rang hollow when hundreds of thousands of African Americans were enslaved, including several hundred held by Jefferson himself. The word \"men\" was well-chosen; equal rights for women were not on the Framers' agenda. And not only slaves were deemed less than \"equal:\" free nonwhites as well as white men who did not own property were largely excluded from the franchise in our early days.\n\nIt took a struggle of nearly two centuries – through abolition of slavery, winning of women's suffrage and elimination of legal Jim Crow – before the United States could be truly said to enfranchise all of its citizens (except, of course, colonial subjects such as those in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico). But even with the right to vote, the promised \"pursuit of happiness\" proved out of reach for many absent another set of rights – economic rights.\n\nThe notion that humans have a right to resources sufficient to ensure a decent quality of life is a relatively new one. This idea began to take shape during the labor struggles of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and was given greater voice by the growing socialist movement, which saw itself as the political expression of workplace struggles. For many decades, socialists were at the forefront in championing such then-radical notions as universal healthcare, a minimum wage, old-age pensions and other economic rights. With Franklin Roosevelt's inclusion of \"freedom from want\" as part of his Four Freedoms, a central tenet of socialism had entered the mainstream political debate. However, the continuing dominance of corporate priorities prevented true \"freedom from want\" from becoming anything but a distant dream.\n\nOf course, the struggle for economic rights is only part of the continuing battle for full equality under our Constitution. Immigrants who come to the United States seeking a better life continue to be scapegoated and driven to the shadows. The recent revelations about the extent of the government's surveillance of ordinary Americans show that the Fourth Amendment – our protection against unreasonable government searches and seizures – has been rendered toothless. True gender equality remains a work in progress. The Supreme Court's recent gutting of the Voting Rights Act will make it harder to prevent racial discrimination at the polls. On the other hand, with the Court's striking down of the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, equality for gay and lesbian Americans has taken a giant step forward, if not necessarily over the finish line.\n\nSo what does Bastille Day have to do with American socialists? In celebrating the fall of the Bastille, the French celebrate not the end of a struggle, but its beginning. July 14, 1789 can be said to mark the date the common people of France began to take responsibility for their destiny. Yet a long struggle lay ahead before the promises of *liberté, egalité,* and *fraternité* truly began to be realized. Likewise, socialists – in the United States and across the world – are facing a struggle for economic justice that is really just beginning.\n\nSo let's join our French brethren on July 14 in a chorus of \"La Marseillaise\" with the understanding that the greatest part of our battle lies ahead, not behind.\n\n\n\n***Join DSA for the 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the March on Washington***.

Progressive partners at the [Economic Policy Institute](http://www.epi.org/publication/unfinished-march-overview/), [The Nation](http://www.thenation.com/blog/175022/week-poverty-unfinished-march-washington-jobs-and-freedom#axzz2XqNvRFBa) and other think tanks and analytical media are anatomizing the sorry state of the jobs and freedom landscape. The half-century anniversary of the 1963 march appears to be generating a big-time *hommage* event, and progressives are working to be sure it is more than a re-enactment. Startlingly, the changing distribution of power in the last half-century has put working people, the poor and their progressive allies in some ways farther behind the curve now than then. And racial inequality persists in meaningful ways: housing, education, employment.\n\nDemocratic socialists' structural linkage of racial inequality to parallel inequalities of social and economic class and their roots in unchecked corporate hegenomy have made, and will make, our take on these matters awkward for our alliances. The unfinished business of the 1963 march is, in part, a result of that signal event's focus on the far starker inequalities of the day. But as the EPI report observes, organizers A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin saw some of those linkages very well: \"\\[Randolph and Rustin\\] understood that improving the socioeconomic position of African Americans required an end to both race- and class-based injustices in America.\" Still, the observation this year of the anniversary of that foundational gathering can skew the view of today's conditions.\n\nIt is worth discussing whether the lessons learned in the intervening half-century are applicable to today's conditions. As socialists, we have always looked skeptically at solutions based in party politics. Even so, perhaps not skeptically enough. The political system indisputably has failed to address many issues of the 1963 March's platform. Such allies as we have in today's formal electoral politics are embattled and isolated in ways that would have seemed near-impossible in 1963. Despite the undeniable advances on some fronts since then, many gates to a good society, let alone \"Great,\" are closed, or guarded by the minions of corporate hegemony.\n\nEPI's anatomy of the shortfalls since 1963's hope and promise is a good starting point. But a socialist take, acknowledging the failure of electoral political strategy, looks deeper. EPI economist Algernon Austin identifies:\n\n**Housing**: Neighborhoods remain segregated by race and resources; \"today, nearly half of poor black children live in neighborhoods with concentrated poverty; however, only a little more than a tenth of poor white children live in similar neighborhoods.\" We socialists would add that housing for the many has been degraded or denied by a corporate and policy focus on housing as fungible wealth, seldom matched to or responsive to community or family needs, profligate by its sprawling nature with energy and other resources, blatantly designed to separate social and economic classes on the bogus claim of personal security, and deliberately made vulnerable to bubble finance by corporate fiat. Regulation of this vital resource is distributed over power centers at federal, state and local levels – and hardly by accident — that work at cross-purposes and are easily corrupted by the major money involved.\n\n**Education**: Austin observes that \"In the late 1960s, 76.6 percent of black children attended majority black schools. In 2010, 74.1 percent of black children attended majority nonwhite schools.\" As he notes, inequality of community resources condemns most of those schools to a kind of subsistence learning. Socialists link the impoverishment of communities (see housing, above) and their schools at the deepest level. Education's continued inequality and failure reflects, at the K-12 level, the debased, segregated housing stock that serves as its tax/resource base; higher education is crippled by the corporate free ride now in place in most states' fiscal policies, ratcheting up public university tuition as tax resources flag. Within the education sphere, a well-funded bright line identifies the path of ruling class reproduction through private, branded institutions priced out of the reach of most. A reasonable, detached perspective on the arcane and tradition-bound sphere of education, skills development and personal growth would recommend not tinkering but wholesale replacement of the features and conditions of this essential public activity.\n\n**Work:** Austin notes that the disparity in unemployment between black and white workers remains roughly double in the Lesser Depression, as in 1963, though it improved considerable in boom times in the interval. He notes that the UAW's Walter Reuther spoke at the 1963 march, and \"Reuther and other march organizers believed that the United States had the wealth to provide a job to everyone who wanted to work, but lacked sufficient political will to do so. They launched the march in part to build that political will. It is shocking how relevant their complaint is today.\"\n\nAs socialists, we concur with that halcyon view. But we lament that the terms of employment are far more firmly in the hands of corporate power today than they were in 1963, despite the fair-employment legislation that has intervened. The ruinous long-range effects of Taft-Hartley were only beginning to be felt then, and union strength stood at around 29-30 percent of the total workforce, compared to today's 12 percent. Worker control over their conditions of employment are checkmated by corporate power. Corporate frames constrain the options of workers and limit their freedom to be compensated for their actual skills. The frames extend, as the EPI overview separately observes, to a management grip on compensation anchored by the appallingly low, certainly non-\"living\", minimum wage. No political activity, even in the Great Society years, has come close to penetrating the armor of economic control that drives all those factors and appears to have nearly peaked in the present era.\n\nThe sphere of labor and consumption, an area where US working families need to, and should, exercise collective political will, is instead wholly owned by the corporate hegemons, and administered to their benefit with the collusion of the failed, co-opted political system.\n\nThis, a reader might justly say, is an unpleasant and perhaps exaggerated view of the current situation, the unfinished business of the march. It emphasizes, purposely, what I see as the democratic socialist view of the interlocking coercive factors that tie down both US working families and the broader society in which they increasingly are becoming the helots. The web is more securely woven than ever, and the US political system is co-opted into it just as securely. Rough and scary as the racial conflict of 1963 was, progressive forces across the board carried more weight.\n\nMany DSA members are lucky enough to have knowledge-work kinds of jobs that provide a little more reward, a little more agency and autonomy. But we recognize we are equally locked into a wage-and-hour system that organizes almost fetishistically the total routines of our lives. A job is full-time, or part-time, or even more contingent than that, and often provided or withheld at will by the employer. There is in effect no appeal from that system for individual workers, and less and less respite via the unions, increasingly shackled by labor regulations that tip more and more toward management with every slight, opportunistic shift.\n\nThe fruits of innovation are not applied to redesign of work in society but to the amplification of hegemonic control. As A. Philip Randolph said with his usual startling prescience at the 1963 March, \"Yes, we want a Fair Employment Practice Act, but what good will it do if profit-geared automation destroys the jobsof millions of workers black and white?\"\n\nPart of our work as democratic socialists, we feel, is to keep the totalist nature of this system visible to, under the noses of, the folk being ground down by it. They must be our allies, or we fail. We know that this complex of constraints is designed to be \"normalized,\" to make itself invisible behind the curtain of the everyday. And we know our other duty is to mobilize – in part through that educational, that communicative work – the people under the system's thumb to shake that off and seek to break up the complex of constraints that blights all of our lives.\n\nThe appeal of 1963 was to the political system – so much so, we remember, that the young John Lewis's acerbic attacks on the Kennedy Administration's lackadaisical response to injustice were trimmed out by the \"cooler heads\" in charge of the march. But Lewis's question – where are the politics that will address the injustices of our everyday lives? – is perhaps more unanswered now than it was in 1963. The role of DSA and other organizations and allies on the progressive left is to recognize how limited the political remedies have become as financialization of the 2013 economy has drained the balance from the manufacturing economy in place in 1963, when the head of the UAW was still a national figure. Corporate hegemony is no airy phrase of theory but a representation of today's systemic ruling-class grip on nearly every facet of most lives. Undoing it will require alt-politics to match our alt-labor formations and our Occupy strategies.\n\nThe regional, bottom-up strategies emerging from [work by Richard Wolff and Gar Alperovitz](http://www.demos.org/blog/making-equality-local), among many others, probably offer more return on expenditure of our current resources than pushing at the diminishing part of the electoral sector that has the will or power to effect change. Locating those pressure points – where workers and communities still have the option under law to recover and exercise power in the workplace and in their everyday lives – is not necessarily at the top of our skill set. But it seems to me that we need to get good at that.\n\nThe mobilizing energy of attempts to re-take control of work lives appears more and more a critical piece of the puzzle, a shaking up of local and regional encrustations of power and control that will come to lead the political formations of those regions by the nose. Other alt-methods will be required. Some of them may engender alt-politicians that have the impact on the left that we have seen on the right. There is still room for such anomalies, and DSA and its allies must foster them. But we must not count on them to accomplish our work, at least not\nby themselves. Continuing to pull the shrouds off the moving parts of\nhegemony for all to see, and pushing to encourage and fashion new, popular alternatives to replace them is more necessary than ever. Where the March on Washington pulled the cover off the severest inequalities of race – to much good effect – the effort in 2013 and beyond has to unmask the mechanics of structural class inequalities and show how our society can be different.\n\n**The EPI report:** [**http://www.epi.org/publication/unfinished-march-overview/**](http://www.epi.org/publication/unfinished-march-overview/)\n\n**EPI co-sponsors a symposium, \"Unfinished March,\" July 22 at the AFL-CIO headquarters:** [**http://www.epi.org/event/unfinished-march-symposium/**](http://www.epi.org/event/unfinished-march-symposium/)\n\n**Links to more articles about the 1963 March and its resonances today are in the** [**Good Reads compilation**](http://dsadc.org/socialist-takeaways-bastille-day-march-anniversary-dsa-convention-socialist-support/) **in this issue.**","order":1},{"title":"The Washington Socialist—Midsummer 2013 Issue","author":"Woody Woodruff","issue":"Midsummer 2013","order":-1,"date":"2013-07-14","body":"***The Washington Socialist*&lt;&gt;Midsummer 2013**\n\n*By Carolyn M. Byerly*\n\nMarx and Engels' ideas framed a world gathering of leftist communication scholars in Dublin in late June where 1,400 of us came to explore the theme \"Crises, 'Creative Destruction' and the Global Power and Communication Orders.\" Held at Dublin City University, the meeting of International Association of Media and Communication Research (IAMCR) had a number of notable headline speakers worthy of sharing with our socialist readers.\n\nIreland's President Michael D. Higgins, a former college professor and political leader, [*electrified the audience*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJD2ctD323A&feature=youtu.be) in an opening address by critiquing neoliberalism and decrying the rise of communication conglomerates and the concentrated ownership that they have produced. As he recounted the litany of problems this process has spawned, I mused at his [*complex understanding*](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/broadcasting-in-crisis-says-president-1.1442609) of the situation and his forthrightness in talking about it in what can only be called radical terms. What a refreshing turn to hear this from the president of a nation!\n\nOn June 27, John Bellamy Foster, sociologist on the University of Oregon faculty and editor of the *Monthly Review* journal, responded to the conference theme in a keynote that focused on the intersection of the communications revolution in relation to darker processes. Foster called the phenomenon a \"crossing of planetary boundaries.\" Economic and environmental crises, he said, have intersected to bring us to a point never before known in human history.\n\nWith regard to economics, he said, the financialization process has made an unprecedented shift over three decades such that the financial sector has become dominant. This has occurred in such a way that money produces more money without the intervention of commodities, whose use value has become displaced by raw speculation. Foster observed that large corporations now control so much surplus profit they don't know what to do with it. It is estimated to be in the trillions, and it is not trickling back into the broader economy.\n\nWith regard to the environment, he said, we are seeing the destruction of nature's real value to promote exchange value of its resources. Half of all species are expected to become extinct by the end of this century. Carbon emissions are reaching the point of no return as we see an accelerated melting of polar icecaps and other dramatic changes with ever-increasing rises in earth's temperatures.\n\nHigh technologies were supposed to generate prosperity. In fact, economies continue to stagnate. \"Go green\" with expanded use of digital technology was the mantra to convince us that technology would reduce consumption of natural resources. In fact, we are consuming more. Communication is today little more than an appendage of capital markets, seen, for example, in the Internet's commercialization. Communication companies are giant monopolies.\n\nFoster turned to Shumpeter's explication of Marx and Engel's notion of \"creative destruction\" (originally put forth in the *Communist Manifesto*, 1848), a term that refers to the way that capitalist economic development emerges from the destruction of whatever economic order came before it. Today, monopolies undermine the institutional framework of capitalism with their surplus profits that do not flow back into the economy. This is seen most profoundly in the cheapening of labor, which is suffering. People are revolting against these realities on a \"scale not seen since 1968,\" Foster said, as he referred to Occupy Wall Street, and recent revolts in Turkey and Brazil. As for the role of intellectuals, Foster believes that \"we must not just describe the destruction of the world but enter into the posing of new possibilities.\" He ended without so much as a glimmer of what those might include – we are thus challenged to pursue them in his articles and books.\n\nOn June 28, political theorist Jodi Dean, from the Hobart and William Smith Colleges, explored what she called \"communicative capitalism,\" which offered a scathing critique of social networking, hailed by many as providing a new public sphere. Dean's central thesis is that this new digital phenomenon is no more than \"communicative capitalism\", which is characterized by three key features.\n\nThe first is a change in the form of utterance, i.e., an exploitation of communication by promoting the belief that \"messages are contributions\" that matter, and that all messages have value (be they jokes or brilliant opinions). The second is a decline in symbolic efficiency, i.e., a lessening of the meaning of symbols that we have held in common. Communities are held together by systems of shared symbols, whether they be flags, artwork, or other familiar icons. By contrast, social networking supports the notion that circulating a photo or another image carries the same level of shared meaning with it that as those emerging from more traditional histories, sufferings, or other experiences. In addition, social networkers also assume that the image represents an actual message, i.e., an articulated explanation. She rejects this assumption, which she believes is promulgated by a materialist society shaped by advertising, public relations and other communication forms empty of real meaning. The third characteristic of communicative capitalism, according to Dean, is reflexivity, i.e., the constant reconsideration of what and who we are and what we believe. \"Nothing is ever settled, we don't really make a decision or take a stand,\" she said. As a result, people are unengaged in their social and political milieux.\n\nOne of the more interesting aspects of Dean's analysis was her foray into the capitalist dimensions of her topic. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and other popular websites are not only hugely wealthy from our participation in their offerings but they also commodify our communication with them by accumulating metadata on us that they market to others. Dean emphasized that the profit and power dimensions of social networking (or eCommerce) are not always obvious to those who think they are engaging in social change by using them.\n\nIn a spirited exchange with the audience during Q & A, Dean added that so-called political activism on the Internet has not brought about any real (structural) changes. She gave some compelling examples. The celebrated Arab Spring that emerged in 2010 wasn't brought about by Facebook, as many have claimed, she said, but rather the less visible building up of analyses among popular leaders and intellectuals, the forming of organizations and setting of agendas in more traditional ways among discontented people in North African nations. We have known about the US military's torture in war since the Abu Ghraib photos were posted online nearly 10 years ago, she said, but there is no evidence torture has in any way stopped or lessened. Wikileaks' massive online disclosures of top security documents have produced no changes in government policies, she said. All of these examples illustrate people's participation in democratic communication, of course, but they do not reduce real problems which caused them in the first place nor do they lead to more equality and fairness. What is needed to produce such structural changes, she said, is a vision of communism, something she sets forth in depth in her most recent book, the *Communist Horizon* (Verso, 2012).\n\nI was provoked by these speakers, whose ideas were fresh and consciousness-expanding, but my feminist sensibilities also found me frustrated. Broad macro-level analyses matter, but I believe their abstract landscapes need to be populated by real people at some point. There is an assumption among many Leftists that offering a class analysis is enough because class relations represent the central problem we are meant to grapple with. In truth political and economic equality fall along the fault lines of gender and race.\n\nTo take John Bellamy Foster's reference to the \"cheapening of labor\", for instance, requires a recognition that women's labor is compensated at lower rates than men's all over the world. Women are not only poorer than men but they also work the \"double-day\" of domestic chores in addition to work outside the home (a point also missed by Marx). Jodi Dean's omission of women from her critique was perhaps the most surprising since her work has incorporated feminist analyses. While I am in complete agreement with her on most of her points, I would have liked some recognition from her that digital technology (for all of its commercialized realities) has allowed women the means to mobilize small-scale campaigns that have produced real outcomes that mattered to us women.\n\nIt was, for example, feminists (particularly feminists of color) who used Facebook and other social networking to mobilize public opinion against Don Imus's racist and sexist comments about the University of Connecticut women basketball players a couple of years ago that got him fired from radio. In addition, African American leaders generated a campaign against the news media a few years ago for failing to report on missing Black women like LaToyia Figueroa (as they do on missing White women like Natalee Holloway). Figueroa's case then emerged in the news, prompting police investigations and an arrest. As someone who studies political (and other) communication, I believe these smaller-scale events can be instructive as to the potential value of new technologies in political formation. Popular movements among marginalized peoples begin on the margins and may build over time, with structural change coming later. In addition, social networks are still relatively new and their cumulative impacts in the broader social structure cannot really be assessed for some time to come. My call for Foster and Dean's greater attention to gender dimensions in capitalism does not obviate the need for class analysis. With specific regard to the ownership of social networking sites by the oligarchs who also control the broader political economy, I am one democratic socialist who would like to see DSA take a more active role in addressing communication structures and policies that enable them to exist as monopolies.\n\nUPDATE July 24...
